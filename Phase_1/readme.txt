Abstract: 
=================================================
Every day more than 8 million people travel using ?ight. Safety is a prime
concern in the aviation feld. It is a challenging task to identify all the safety
measures for an aircraft to avoid an accident. The causes of aircraft accidents are often convoluted and tangled. There might be cascading causes
which resulted in an aircraft accident, but they remain obscure after an investigation by humans because of the inability of a person to spot the root
cause of the accident in a long chain of events following an accident. The
objective of the project is to derive intelligence and insights from 2 domains
â€“ Investigation report domain and operations domain and identify areas of
opportunity to improve safety and performance. The scope of the project is
limited to civil aviation aerospace domain. These insights derived can result
in improvements in system design, operational procedures, improvement in
training methods and new mandates thereby enhancing overall safety in the
domain.
The project is in collaboration with Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc.
started in 2019. It is a 3-year project. To retrieve information from data
and enable automated reasoning, we decided to design Knowledge Graphs
(KG) of two domains. Currently, we have built the KG of aircraft accident
reports using data of US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). In
this report, the development of the aircraft accident KG is described. We
have started inspecting the aircraft safety manuals to get started with the
KG of aircraft manuals and operations.

Contents of the folder:
=================================================
1. Data :: Contains Aircraft Accident Reports scraped from NTSB website
(a) PDFs- contains pdf reports of accidents year and month wise.
(b) Texts - processed pdf reports in text format.
(c) Tokenized - Contains tokenized sentences from Texts folder.
(d) OntologyData2001-2018.xlsx - contains all instances for the classes of knowledge graph. This sheet is created by extracting the required information from the NTSB aircraft accident reports.


2. Documents :: contains the documentation of my MTP.
