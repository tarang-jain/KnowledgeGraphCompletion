Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: Broomfield, CO
Accident Number: DEN07LA132
Date & Time: 08/01/2007, 1635 MDT
Registration: N568TD
Aircraft: Bell 206B
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 2 Minor, 2 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Business - Sightseeing
 Analysis According to the pilot, this was his sixth sightseeing flight of the day.
He had just landed and three passengers disembarked.
Three other passengers boarded the helicopter.
As the pilot brought the throttle to full rpm and increased torque, the helicopter turned left about 15 degrees.
Approximately 3 inches of opposite pedal was used to bring the helicopter back to its original heading.
The pilot continued to increase torque and as the skids started to come off the ground, the nose pitched up rapidly and the helicopter rolled to the right.
The left skid was about 3 inches off the ground during the yaw.
The right skid never left the ground.
Full forward and left cyclic had no effect.
The pilot then lowered collective and tried to roll off the throttle.
The helicopter rolled right until the main rotor blades contacted the ground.
A piece of main rotor blade struck a nearby hangar.
The pilot reported no control anomalies and a subsequent examination revealed no discrepancies.
FAA's "Rotorcraft Flying Handbook" (FAA-H-8083-21) defines "dynamic rollover" as "the tendency of a helicopter to continue rolling when the critical angle is exceeded, if one gear is on the ground, and the helicopter is pivoting around that point."
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain control of the helicopter, resulting in an inadvertent dynamic rollover.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - ON GROUND/WATER Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF Findings 1.
(C) AIRCRAFT CONTROL - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND ---------- Occurrence #2: ROLL OVER Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF Findings 2.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.
The sightseeing flight was being conducted under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91 without a flight plan.
The pilot and two passengers aboard the helicopter received minor injuries.
One passenger was not injured.
The local flight was originating at the time of the accident.

The helicopter rolled right until the main rotor blades contacted the ground.
A piece of main rotor blade struck a nearby hangar.
The pilot reported no control anomalies.
On August 15, 2007, the helicopter was examined by FAA and Bell Helicopter investigators.
They reported finding no anomalies.
FAA's "Rotorcraft Flying Handbook" (FAA-H-8083-21) defines "dynamic rollover" as "the tendency of a helicopter to continue rolling when the critical angle is exceeded, if one gear is on the ground, and the helicopter is pivoting around that point."
It elaborates:  "A helicopter is susceptible to a lateral rolling tendency, called dynamic rollover, when lifting off the surface.
For dynamic rollover to occur, some factor has to first cause the helicopter to roll or pivot around a skid...until its critical rollover angle is reached.
Then, beyond this point, main rotor thrust continues the roll and recovery is impossible.
If the critical rollover angle is exceeded, the helicopter rolls on its side regardless of the cyclic corrections made."
