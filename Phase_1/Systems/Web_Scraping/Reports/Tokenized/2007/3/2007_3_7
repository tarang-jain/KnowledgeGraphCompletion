 Analysis The airplane collided with a berm during a forced landing in an industrial building construction site following a loss of engine power.
The pilot stated that during the preflight inspection he did not check the fuel quantity.
He stated that a month prior to the accident the airplane had been "topped off," and then flown about an hour from the right fuel tank.
The pilot also said that during the 160 nautical mile accident flight he did not recall switching fuel tanks.
About 3 miles north of the destination airport the engine sputtered and lost power.
He switched tanks and activated the electric fuel boost pump, the engine restarted momentarily, then sputtered and lost power again.
The pilot switched tanks three or four more times to no avail.
Post accident inspection of the airplane by the FAA revealed that the right fuel tank was empty and the left tank contained about 6 gallons of 100LL aviation fuel.
The fuel line to the carburetor did not contain any fuel.
