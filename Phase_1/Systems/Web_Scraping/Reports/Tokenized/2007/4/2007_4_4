 Analysis The pilot stated he was 15 miles north of the destination airport when he was cleared for a left downwind landing.
He said he switched from the right fuel tank to the left fuel tank, and noted the right fuel tank was indicating 20 gallons.
When he selected flaps, they would not work.
On short final, he attempted to apply power, and noticed the engine was not producing power.
He switched to the right fuel tank, with no response from the engine.
He elected to land in a field, and made a hard landing in the grass, where the airplane nosed over.
