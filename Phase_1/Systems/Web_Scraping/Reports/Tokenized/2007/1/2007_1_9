 Analysis The pilot was performing a takeoff on runway 05, a 2,200-foot long asphalt runway.
About three quarters down the runway, the pilot attempted to rotate the airplane, but it did not respond well.
The pilot then noted that the airspeed indicator appeared to indicate less than the 65-knot speed needed to continue with rotation.
At that time, the pilot aborted the takeoff; and the airplane overran the runway and strucks rocks.
Winds were reported as calm at the time of the accident.
The pilot also reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane.
