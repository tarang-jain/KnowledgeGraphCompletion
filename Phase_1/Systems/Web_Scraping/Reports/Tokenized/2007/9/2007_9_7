Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The gyrocopter collided with high vegetation and rough terrain during a forced autorotation following the in-flight separation of a propeller blade.
The pilot reported that the muffler's mounting strap broke during cruise flight, which caused one composite pusher propeller blade to separate.
The pilot autorotated to a forced landing in a ravine.
During touchdown the gyrocopter rolled over upon impacting 5-foot-high bushes.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: Failure of the muffler's mounting strap and subsequent loss of engine power due to propeller blade separation during cruise flight.
A contributing factor was the unsuitable terrain for a forced landing.
