 Analysis The experimental powered parachute aircraft collided with a fence during an aborted takeoff, resulting in serious injuries to the pilot.
The student pilot's first takeoff and landing were uneventful.
Prior to commencing the second takeoff in calm wind conditions, the pilot "checked and double checked [the] chute and aircraft...everything checked out."
The pilot applied engine power and began taking off from the 40-acre field.
The chute did not completely open and it appeared to be tucked in on the right side, which resulted in the chute drifting left.
The pilot did not maintain directional control of his aircraft, and at 20 feet above the ground he elected to abort the climb as he approached the runway's end.
The airplane impacted a nearby fence at full throttle.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The failure of the parachute wing to completely deploy, which resulted in the pilot's failure to maintain directional control during takeoff.
