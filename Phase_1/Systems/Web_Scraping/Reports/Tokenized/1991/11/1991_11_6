 Analysis AFTER TAKEOFF WITH THE FUEL SELECTOR POSITIONED TO THE AUXILIARY FUEL TANK, THE ENG QUIT DUE TO FUEL EXHAUSTION IN THAT TANK.
THE PLT REPOSITIONED THE FUEL SELECTOR TO THE MAIN FUEL TANK POSITION WHICH CONTAINED AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF FUEL, BUT THE ENG STARTED ONLY MOMENTARILY, THEN QUIT.
THE PILOT LANDED THE ACFT GEAR UP IN A FIELD.
