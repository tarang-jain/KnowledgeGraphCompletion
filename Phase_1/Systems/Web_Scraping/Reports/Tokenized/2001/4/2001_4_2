At the time of the accident, the wind was from 250 degrees at 15 knots.
In his accident report, the pilot said the initial portion of the takeoff was normal, but after the airplane had rolled 520 feet, "directional control was lost and the aircraft departed the runway at about a 30 degree angle."
The airplane became airborne and continued 524 feet before crossing a small ditch and colliding with a barbed wire fence.
The airplane traveled another 40 feet before striking the ground in a right wing low attitude.
The right main landing gear collapsed and the airplane skidded another 16 feet before nosing over.
The pilot said that there were gusty crosswinds at the time of the accident and that is was "likely that a wind gust in excess of the aircraft's capability was encountered."
