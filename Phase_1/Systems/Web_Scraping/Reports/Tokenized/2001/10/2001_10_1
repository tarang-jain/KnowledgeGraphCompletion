 Analysis The pilot said he was in a left turning descent from approximately 1,000 feet agl to approximately 700 feet agl when the airplane's left wing dropped.
The pilot said, "I applied right stick, and simultaneously the airplane entered a spin.
I pushed the stick immediately forward and applied right rudder - waiting for the aircraft to recover.
The aircraft recovered approximately 35 feet from the ground, below a tree line that was quickly approaching.
There was an area of open (unobstructed) ground to my left and I elected to land there.
During the landing one of the landing gear collapsed and I slid to a stop short of the trees."
