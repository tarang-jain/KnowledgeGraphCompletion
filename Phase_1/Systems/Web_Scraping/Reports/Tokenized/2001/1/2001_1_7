 Analysis The student pilot lost directional control of the aircraft during a takeoff run while practicing solo touch-and-go landings.
The pilot stated that after a successful landing he initiated a takeoff and, "as I added power the airplane seemed to shimmy at which time I tried to correct the plane.
As I was unable to correct I powered back to idle and tried to stop which is when the plane went off the left side of the runway and hit a windrow of snow."
The pilot reported, "Hitting the snow made the planes [plane's] tail lift and spin around which made the right wing hit the ground causing damage."

The pilot reported that he had accumulated 1.4-hours of pilot-in-command time.
