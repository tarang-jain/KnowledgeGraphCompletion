Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: Logan, UT
Accident Number: DEN01LA061
Date & Time: 03/03/2001, 1245 MST
Registration: N152RC
Aircraft: Cessna 152
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
 Analysis This was the student pilot's first solo flight.
The first two landings on runway 35 had been accomplished without incident.
The approach for a third landing had to be abandoned because there was an airplane still on the runway.
The next approach resulted in a normal landing but during the rollout, the airplane raised up on its left main landing wheel.
"I couldn't control the plane," the pilot wrote.
The airplane veered "very hard" to the left into a snow bank.
Winds recorded 6 minutes after the accident were from 240 degrees at 6 knots.
This would present the pilot with slightly less than a 6 knot left crosswind component and a 2 knot tailwind component.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during landing.
