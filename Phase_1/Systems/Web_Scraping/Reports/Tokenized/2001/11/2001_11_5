 Analysis The experimental-category amateur-built airplane suffered a broken weld in the right main landing gear during landing, resulting in a separation of the right main gear tire.
The pilot reported that he landed to the north (runway 32) on a 4,529- by 100-foot hard-surface runway.
He reported that he touched down with a light bounce.
He stated that while rolling, there was suddenly a violent pull to the right after hearing a "crunch."
The pilot reported that he applied left brake but that the plane left the runway to the right, went into the dirt and up onto its nose and upper left wingtip.
He reported that the aircraft, including the failed part, had 17.4 hours total time.
The pilot, who had built the aircraft, listed "better construction [technique] by builder" as an owner/operator safety recommendation on his NTSB accident report.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: An improper weld in the landing gear, resulting in separation of the right main landing gear wheel during a normal landing.
Findings Occurrence #1: AIRFRAME/COMPONENT/SYSTEM FAILURE/MALFUNCTION Phase of Operation: LANDING Findings 1.
