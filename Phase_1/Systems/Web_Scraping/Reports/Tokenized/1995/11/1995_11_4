TERRAIN CONDITION - DITCH Factual Information On November 2, 1995, at 1000 eastern standard time, N2132Q, a Cessna 177RG, sustained substantial damage when the main landing gear collapsed during landing on runway 15 at College Park Airport, College Park, Maryland.
The certificated commercial pilot and the passenger were not injured.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed.
The local personal flight was conducted under 14 CFR 91.
The pilot stated: "[The] Gear down switch was actuated and cycle appeared normal.
Visual gear down on both sides, right side was witnessed...smooth and soft flare, smooth main contact with ground.
Nice roll on all three gear, then upon application of brakes, felt a bump as if hitting a log on runway, then a sense of the nose rising, which was actually the seat getting lower and lower towards the ground.
Aircraft doing approx.
30 mph left runway...came to stop leaning to the left."
According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector, when the landing gear collapsed, the aircraft veered off the runway and collided with a ditch.
The aircraft was removed and sent to a repair facility for further examination.
