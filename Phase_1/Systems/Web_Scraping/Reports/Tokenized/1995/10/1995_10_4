OBJECT - WIRE,TRANSMISSION Factual Information On October 1, 1995, at 1845 central daylight time, an Aerostar S60A balloon, N63286, was substantially damaged during an approach to land in a field near Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
The pilot and two passengers were not injured.
The balloon, owned by the pilot, was being operated under Title 14 CFR Part 91.
The personal flight was participating in a local ballooning event.
A flight plan was not filed and visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
In an interview, the pilot stated that she commenced an approach to land in a field located between power lines and an apartment complex.
During the approach, she "passed over the power lines", and about 20 feet prior to touch down, a "sudden, strong gust of wind" pushed the balloon "downward and backward."
Subsequently, the envelope contacted the power lines that she had "passed over", and the basket contacted the ground.
She further stated that, after contacting the ground, the balloon began to slide sideways and contacted another power line.
Examination of the balloon revealed arcing on the basket attaching cables and a torn envelope.
