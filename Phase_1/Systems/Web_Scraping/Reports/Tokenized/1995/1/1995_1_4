ADDITIONALLY, ALTITUDE/CLEARANCE NOT MAINTAINED WHILE ON SHORT FINAL APPROACH RESULTING IN THE COLLISION WITH AN UNMARKED STATIC POWER LINE.
Findings Occurrence #1: UNDERSHOOT Phase of Operation: APPROACH - VFR PATTERN - FINAL APPROACH Findings 1.
(C) DISTANCE/ALTITUDE - MISJUDGED - PILOT IN COMMAND ---------- Occurrence #2: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH OBJECT Phase of Operation: APPROACH - VFR PATTERN - FINAL APPROACH Findings 2.
OBJECT - WIRE,STATIC 3.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed.
The airplane was substantially damaged and the pilot and one passenger were fatally injured.
One passenger sustained serious injuries and one passenger sustained minor injuries.
The flight originated from the Avon Park Municipal Airport, Avon Park, Florida, about 1240.
An individual who was monitoring the Wauchula Airport Common Traffic Advisory Frequency 122.9 due to a gyrocopter fly-in, heard an occupant in N5037 announce that the flight was on left downwind for runway 18, "close in."
He advised that person that there were numerous gyrocopters in the area and in turn advised the gyrocopter pilots by visual signal to stay clear of the fixed wing airplane.
He observed the airplane turn left base and the occupant asked about the fuel supply on the airport.
He then heard the individual announce that the flight was on final approach to runway 18, which he thought the airplane was low.
The individual in N5037 did not mention any problem with the airplane or engine and the witness stated that the engine was operating normally.
Another witness also observed N5037 on the downwind leg for runway 18 stated that the airplane appeared to be low.
He observed the airplane turn left base to final and while on final approach, the airplane appeared to be low.
While on final approach he observed a flash of light just before the airplane nosed over.
He then lost sight of the airplane due to obstructions.
He also stated that he was too far away to hear the engine.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION Information pertaining to the airplane is contained in the NTSB Report-Aviation.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION Information pertaining to the weather is contained in the NTSB Factual Report-Aviation.
COMMUNICATIONS An individual in the airplane announced his traffic pattern positions on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency.
AERODROME INFORMATION The airport is not certificated under 14 CFR Part 139 and has a 4,000-foot asphalt runway designated 18/36, which is a visual runway as defined by 14 CFR Part 77.2.
Unmarked power lines parallel both sides of a road which is located north of the approach end of runway 18.
The road is nearly perpendicular to the runway near the airport.
According to the Orlando, Florida, FAA Airports District Office, the power line was not required to be marked.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT Examination of the accident site revealed a cable on the ground adjacent to the airplane.
The wreckage was upright with the nose landing gear separated.
The right wing fuel tank was damaged resulting in fuel leakage; however, the tank was found to contain about 1 gallon of fuel when drained.
The left wing fuel tank which was not damaged was drained revealing that it contained about 10 gallons.
Examination of the drained fuel revealed no evidence of contamination.
The fuel selector was found to be positioned to the right tank.
Examination of the flight controls revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.
Examination of the Ellison Throttle Body Injection unit revealed that the throttle was at idle.
The carburetor heat was determined to be on.
Examination of the nose landing gear which was separated revealed evidence that the static line contacted it about 17 inches up from the swivel assembly.
There was also evidence that the static line contacted both main landing gear near the juncture of the fuselage.
The engine with engine mount and propeller attached were removed from the airframe and placed on a stand.
The engine was started and found to operate normally.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL Post-mortem examination of the pilot and right front seat passenger were performed by Alexander Melamud, M.D., District Ten, Medical Examiner.
The cause of death for both was listed as multiple injuries.
Toxicological analysis of specimens of the pilot was performed by the Wuesthoff Memorial Hospital Laboratory.
The results of analysis of urine tests were positive for caffeine, nicotine, and nicotine metabolite.
The results were negative for cannabinoids, cocaine metabolite, opiates, benzodiazepines, and salicylate.
The results were positive in the blood for caffeine.
The results of blood analysis were negative for cannabinoids, cocaine metabolite, opiates, salicylate, benzodiazepines, and volatiles.
Glucose (1 MG/DL) was detected in vitreous fluid.
