 Analysis THE PILOT IN THE NUMBER 3 AIRCRAFT, IN POSITION ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY, COLLIDED WITH THE NUMBER 2 AIRCRAFT, POSITIONED FOR TAKEOFF ON THE LEFT SIDE, ABOUT 5 TO 6 SECONDS AFTER THE LEAD AIRCRAFT BEGAN ITS TAKEOFF ROLL.
THE NUMBER 3 PILOT THOUGHT THAT THE NUMBER 2 PILOT WAS TAKING OFF WITH THE LEAD AIRCRAFT AND INITIATED HIS TAKEOFF ROLL AFTER COUNTING TO 5 SECONDS.
THE NUMBER 2 PILOT STATED THAT THE GROUP OF PILOTS DECIDED EARLIER ON INTERVAL TAKEOFFS DUE TO THE NARROW RUNWAY.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The failure of the pilot of the other aircraft to follow pre-briefed instructions and failure to see and avoid the preceding aircraft awaiting takeoff.
Findings Occurrence #1: ON GROUND/WATER COLLISION WITH OBJECT Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - ROLL/RUN Findings 1.
(C) CREW/GROUP BRIEFING - NOT FOLLOWED - PILOT OF OTHER AIRCRAFT 2.
(C) VISUAL LOOKOUT - INADEQUATE - PILOT OF OTHER AIRCRAFT Factual Information On August 1, 1995, at 0900 hours mountain standard time, a North American AT-6B, N105DG, collided with another AT-6, N90629, on the runway at the beginning of a takeoff roll at the airport in Glendale, Arizona.
Visual meteorological conditions existed at the time for the pleasure flight to El Paso, Texas.
The AT-6 (N90629) awaiting takeoff on the runway received substantial damage when the AT-6 (N105DG) behind it started its takeoff roll and collided with the wing of N90629.
The two pilots and one passenger were not injured.
The two aircraft were part of a group of five WW-II Warbirds departing single ship from runway 01 for an across-the-country tour of aircraft celebrating the end of the World War II.
The investigation revealed that N105DG was number 3 in the group of similar aircraft to takeoff.
The number 1 aircraft began its take off with about 5 seconds separation for spacing.
The number 2 aircraft (N90629) was waiting his turn, as briefed, for takeoff when the collision occurred.
The pilot of the number 3 aircraft stated to an Federal Aviation Administration inspector that he didn't understand the pretakeoff pilot briefing regarding the takeoff procedures.
He initiated his takeoff and his left wing collided with the right wing of the number 2 aircraft.
The pilot of N105DG stated in his report that he understood that the number 2 aircraft would be making a formation takeoff with the lead aircraft.
All aircraft taxied onto the runway and he then lined up on the right side of the runway with the number 1 aircraft in view.
He observed the lead aircraft begin its takeoff roll and assumed that the number 2 aircraft was rolling within formation with him.
The pilot counted 5 to 6 seconds for spacing and started his takeoff roll.
He angled to the left to align the aircraft with the runway centerline and then straightened out on the runway centerline.
At this time, the pilot observed the number 2 aircraft still stationary in front and to the left.
He attempted to avoid a collision by going to the right but was unsuccessful.
The left wing of N105DG collided with the right wing of N90629.
The pilot of N90629 stated in his report that he pulled nearly abeam of the lead aircraft and stopped.
After lead began his takeoff roll, he began to count before he released his brakes.
As he reached the count of 4 seconds, N105DG went by on the right and collided with his right wing.
He further stated that the group had briefed at 0800 that morning and it was decided that an interval takeoff would be made because the runway was too narrow.
Runway 01 at the Glendale airport is 5,350 feet in length and 75 feet wide.
The pilot in N105DG stated he was seated in the rear seat.
The front seat was occupied by a pilot rated passenger.
