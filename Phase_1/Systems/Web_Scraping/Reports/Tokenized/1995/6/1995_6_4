The commercial pilot was not injured.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight.
According to witnesses at the airport, the airplane was executing a touch and go landing on Runway 10 at the Easterwood Airport (CLL).
The pilot made a wheel landing and was rolling on the main tires when control was lost and the airplane departed the runway to the left.
The main gear tires stuck in the soft mud at the edge of the runway and the airplane nosed over coming to rest in the inverted position, resulting in damage to the wings and fuselage.
The pilot stated that he was cleared to follow a Saab 340 airplane to land on runway 10.
The pilot estimated that he had a two mile separation behind the landing regional airliner.
The pilot stated that directional control could not be maintained after encountering the wing vortex wake turbulence from the landing aircraft.
He further stated that the light quartering tailwind prevailing at the time of the accident contributed to the accident.
Wind was from 200 degrees at 4 knots.
