AIRPORT FACILITIES,RUNWAY/LANDING AREA CONDITION - RUNWAY Factual Information On July 1, 1995, at 0733 mountain daylight time, a Piper PA-32- 260, N4823T, was substantially damaged during a forced landing at Farmington, New Mexico.
The private pilot and his four passengers were not injured.
Visual meteorological  conditions prevailed.
The following is based on the pilot/operator report.
Prior to departing Page, Arizona, on June 30, the pilot checked the two auxiliary fuel tanks and estimated each contained 5 gallons.
He flew to Farmington, New Mexico, where he requested that the main tanks be filled to capacity.
Prior to his departure from Farmington on July 1, the pilot checked the main fuel tanks and verified they were full.
He did not check the auxiliary fuel tanks.
While performing the pre- takeoff check, the pilot "glanced at" the fuel selector and "thought it was on the left main" fuel tank.
Shortly after takeoff from Farmington and at an altitude of 150 feet, the engine lost power.
The pilot switched the fuel selector "to the next tank to the right," then made a "very hard" landing on the 800 feet of runway remaining.
According to the Piper PA-32 Owner's Handbook, fuel tank selector positions (from left to right) are as follows:  LEFT AUX - LEFT MAIN - RIGHT MAIN - RIGHT AUX.
An OFF position is also provided.
According to the statement submitted by the Federal Aviation Administration inspector who examined the airplane, the pilot stated "he might have made his takeoff" with the fuel selector in the left auxiliary fuel tank position.
The pilot asked the inspector "how long it would take for fuel to reach the engine if it had exhausted the fuel supply from a fuel tank."
The inspector said the right auxiliary fuel tank had about 2 inches of fuel at the bottom of the tank.
The left auxiliary fuel tank "was completely dry as it would not measure on the dipstick."
In the pilot/operator report the pilot wrote, "In the future, I will always check all of the tanks on the airplane and not assume that the auxiliary tanks are unimportant."
