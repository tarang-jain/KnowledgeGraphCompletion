 Analysis WHILE MANEUVERING OVER MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN AT 500 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL, THE AIRPLANE PASSED OVER A RIDGE LINE THEN DROPPED INTO A CANYON.
THE PILOT STATED THAT A 'SEVERE DOWNDRAFT JOLTED THE AIRPLANE...,' AND THE ENGINE LOST POWER.
THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO RESTART THE ENGINE AND THE LANDING GEAR WOULD NOT LOCK DOWN.
A FORCED LANDING WAS MADE TO AN OPEN ROUGH FIELD.
DURING THE LANDING ROLL, THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH THE TERRAIN.
AN EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED A TRACE OF WATER CONTAMINATION IN THE FUEL SYSTEM.
NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND TO INDICATE A MECHANICAL FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DUE TO UNDETERMINED REASONS, AND THE LACK OF A SUITABLE AREA FOR THE FORCED LANDING.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF ENGINE POWER Phase of Operation: MANEUVERING Findings 1.
(C) REASON FOR OCCURRENCE UNDETERMINED ---------- Occurrence #2: FORCED LANDING Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY DESCENT/LANDING ---------- Occurrence #3: ON GROUND/WATER ENCOUNTER WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY DESCENT/LANDING Findings 2.
AIRPORT FACILITIES,RUNWAY/LANDING AREA CONDITION - ROUGH/UNEVEN 3.
(C) AIRPORT FACILITIES,RUNWAY/LANDING AREA CONDITION - NONE SUITABLE Factual Information On July 1, 1995, about 1600 hours mountain daylight time, N4GY, a Cessna 210B, operated by the owner/pilot, was substantially damaged during a forced landing near Lewiston, Montana.
The forced landing was precipitated by a loss of engine power while maneuvering.
The private pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed.
The personal flight departed Butte, Montana, on July 1, 1995, at 1445, and was conducted under 14 CFR 91.
In a written statement, the pilot reported that he was maneuvering in mountainous terrain about 500 feet above ground level.
The airplane passed over a ridge line and then dropped down into a canyon.
The pilot stated that a "downdraft jolted the airplane severely enough to spill cherries from an open flat."
The pilot then stated that the engine lost power.
The electric boost pump was turned on and the fuel selector was switched to another fuel tank; however, the engine did not regain power.
The pilot tried to lower the landing gear for the forced landing; however, the gear did not indicate down and locked even after utilizing the auxiliary gear pump.
During the forced landing to an open rough field, the nose gear was sheared off, the belly was crushed inward, and the right wing was damaged.
During an examination of the wreckage by FAA inspectors from Helena, Montana, fuel was found on board the airplane.
The engine rotated, and  compression developed in each cylinder.
Rocker arm, valve train and accessory gear continuity was established.
All spark plugs appeared unremarkable.
The right magneto produced an intermittent spark due to internal contaminants.
The left magneto produced a spark with hand rotation.
Small amounts of contaminants (water) were found in one of the fuel header tanks, the fuel input filter, and the fuel sump.
