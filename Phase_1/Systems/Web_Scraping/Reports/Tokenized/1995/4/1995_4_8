 Analysis THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO TAKEOFF FROM A GRASS RUNWAY WITH A DIRECT 10 TO 12 KNOT CROSSWIND.
HE STATED 'A GUST OF WIND PUT US AIRBORNE MUCH BEFORE I WAS READY TO BRING UP THE TAIL...BLEW US COMPLETELY OFF THE RUNWAY.'
THE LANDING GEAR CAUGHT THE TOP STRAND OF A BARBED WIRE FENCE.
THE PILOT REPORTED THE AIRPLANE PULLED UP ABOUT 1,000 FEET OF FENCE BEFORE THE AIRPLANE WAS PULLED BACK TO THE GROUND.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions during the attempted takeoff.
The gusty crosswind was a factor.

OBJECT - FENCE ---------- Occurrence #3: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: DESCENT - UNCONTROLLED Factual Information On April 2, 1995, at 1146 central daylight time, a Bellanca 7ECA, N2598Z, piloted by the owner/operator, crashed during an aborted takeoff at a private grass airstrip in Higginsville, Missouri.
The airplane sustained substantial damage when it struck a barbed wire fence, then impacted terrain.
The private pilot and the one passenger on board the airplane received serious injuries.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight, no flight plan was filed.
The pleasure flight operated under 14 CFR Part 91, and the accident occurred during the intended takeoff.
The pilot reported he attempted to takeoff from the 2,300' X 100' grass runway with a direct crosswind which he estimate to be 10 to 12 knots.
He stated "...a gust of wind put us airborne much before I was ready to bring up the tail.
The wind gust blew us completely off the runway.
Unknowingly, as I was attempting to get back to the runway, I picked up the top strand of barbed wire...I pulled up about 1,000 feet of fence before it stopped my flight and caused the plane to crash onto the runway."
The pilot stated the accident could have been prevented if he had been "...very wary of strong crosswinds, particularly when buildings or obstructions are adjacent to runway."
