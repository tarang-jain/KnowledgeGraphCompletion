Location: ERIE, PA
Accident Number: BFO95LA042
Date & Time: 04/01/1995, 1030 EST
Registration: N3546V
Aircraft: CESSNA 150
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis DURING A LOW PASS OVER A GRASS STRIP, THE AIRPLANE'S ENGINE LOST PARTIAL POWER.
THE PILOT OVERFLEW THE STRIP AND ENTERED THE DOWNWIND LEG OF THE TRAFFIC PATTERN.
DURING THE APPROACH THE AIRPLANE'S ALTITUDE WAS TOO LOW AND THE PILOT ADDED POWER.
THE AIRPLANE BEGAN TO 'FLOAT' DOWN THE RUNWAY AND THE ENGINE BEGAN TO BACKFIRE.
THE PILOT DECIDED TO DO A GO AROUND, HOWEVER, THE AIRPLANE'S CLIMB RATE WAS DEGRADED AND THE AIRPLANE COULD NOT CLEAR TREES THAT SURROUNDED THE STRIP.
THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH THE TREES.
THE PILOT STATED THAT HE HAD APPLIED HEAT TO THE CARBURETOR PRIOR TO THE LOW PASS.
POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED NO ANOMALIES.
THE ENGINE WAS STARTED AND RAN FOR FIVE MINUTES WITH NO ANOMALIES NOTED.
CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE TO LIGHT CARBURETOR ICING AT GLIDE OR CRUISE POWER EXISTED.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF ENGINE POWER Phase of Operation: APPROACH Findings 1.
(C) REASON FOR OCCURRENCE UNDETERMINED ---------- Occurrence #2: FORCED LANDING Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY DESCENT/LANDING ---------- Occurrence #3: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY DESCENT/LANDING Findings 2.
(F) TERRAIN CONDITION - NONE SUITABLE Factual Information On April 1, 1995, at 1030 eastern standard time, a Cessna 150, N3546V, lost partial engine power during a low pass over Waisley Airport in Erie, Pennsylvania, and collided with trees during the emergency descent.
The pilot was not injured.
The airplane was substantially damaged.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The local personal flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
The pilot reported that during a low pass over the grass strip at Waisley Airport, the airplane's engine "...started to miss, spit, and sputter."
The pilot stated that prior to the low pass he applied heat to the carburetor and left it on.
The pilot said that he decided to make a precautionary landing and made a downwind pattern for the runway.
The pilot reported, "Did a short downwind pattern, altitude indicated 1250 FT. agl on line up to runway.
The pilot stated that the airplane had "...a poor climb rate..." and would not clear obstacles around the runway.
The pilot stated that he made an emergency landing off the airport and during the descent, the airplane collided with trees.
Postaccident examination of the engine did not reveal any anomalies.
No contaminates were found in the fuel.
The engine was started and run for about five minutes with no anomalies noted.
No airframe anomalies were found.
The pilot stated that he thought "...there was carburetor icing present."
At 0952, the Erie Weather Observation Facility recorded a temperature of 39 degrees Fahrenheit and a dew point of 21 degrees Fahrenheit.
According to Icing Probability Curves, conditions which are known to be favorable to the formation of light induction system icing at glide or cruise power existed.
(See attached Icing Probability Curves.)
