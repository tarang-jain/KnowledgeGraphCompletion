Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: EL INDIO, TX
Accident Number: FTW95LA105
Date & Time: 02/01/1995, 1500 CST
Registration: N6SR
Aircraft: BELL 47G-4A
Aircraft Damage: Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 Minor, 2 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Other Work Use
 Analysis THE HELICOPTER, BEING USED FOR PREDATOR CONTROL, WAS 25 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND WAS CHASING A BOBCAT.
THE PILOT SAID A RIGHT QUARTERING TAILWIND GUST CAUSED THE HELICOPTER TO LOSE TAIL ROTOR EFFECTIVENESS AND IT BEGAN SPINNING TO THE RIGHT.
THE PILOT INCREASED COLLECTIVE AND THROTTLE IN AN ATTEMPT TO REGAIN AIRSPEED, BUT THIS CAUSED THE MAIN ROTOR RPM TO DROOP AND ALTITUDE WAS INSUFFICIENT TO ALLOW THE HELICOPTER TO REGAIN AIRSPEED BY LOWERING THE NOSE.
THE PILOT THEN REDUCED COLLECTIVE TO REGAIN RPM, BUT THE HELICOPTER CONTINUED TO SPIN AND IMPACTED THE TERRAIN.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: THE LOSS OF TAIL ROTOR EFFECTIVENESS.
A FACTOR WAS THE GUSTY RIGHT QUARTERING TAILWIND.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - IN FLIGHT Phase of Operation: MANEUVERING Findings 1.
LOW ALTITUDE FLIGHT/MANEUVER - INTENTIONAL - PILOT IN COMMAND 2.
(C) LOSS OF TAIL ROTOR EFFECTIVENESS - INADVERTENT - PILOT IN COMMAND 3.
(F) WEATHER CONDITION - GUSTS 4.
(F) WEATHER CONDITION - CROSSWIND 5.
(F) WEATHER CONDITION - TAILWIND ---------- Occurrence #2: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: DESCENT - UNCONTROLLED Factual Information On February 1, 1995, approximately 1500 central standard time, a Bell 47G-4A, N6SR, was destroyed when it impacted terrain while maneuvering near El Indio, Texas.
The airline transport rated pilot and one passenger were not injured, but a second passenger received minor injuries.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The following is based on the pilot/operator report.
The helicopter was being used for predator control and was chasing a bobcat about 25 feet above the ground.
The pilot said a right quartering tailwind gust caused the helicopter to lose tail rotor effectiveness and it began spinning to the right.
He increased collective and throttle in an attempt to regain airspeed, but this caused the main rotor RPM to droop and altitude was insufficient to allow the helicopter to regain airspeed by diving.
He then reduced collective to regain RPM, but the helicopter continued to spin and impacted the terrain.
