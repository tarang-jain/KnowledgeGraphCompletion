Aircraft: SCHWEIZER G-164B
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Positioning
 Analysis THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE EXPERIENCED ENGINE POWER FLUCTUATIONS.
WHEN HE SCANNED THE ENGINE GAUGES, HE OBSERVED NO FUEL PRESSURE INDICATION.
HE SET UP FOR A FORCED LANDING, AND THE ENGINE LOST POWER.
HE MANEUVERED OVER A SET OF POWERLINES AND THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER DURING THE LANDING ATTEMPT, SUSTAINING SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.
INSPECTION OF THE AIRPLANE REVEALED THAT THERE WAS SUFFICIENT FUEL ON BOARD, THE GRAVITY FEED FUEL FLOW TO THE FIREWALL WAS VERIFIED, AND THE VENT SYSTEM WAS CHECKED.
EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE AND LOW PRESSURE FUEL PUMP REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF PREIMPACT MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: Loss of engine power due to undetermined reasons.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF ENGINE POWER Phase of Operation: CRUISE Findings 1.
The commercial pilot reported no injuries.
The positioning flight, conducted under 14 CFR Part 91, departed Hershey, Nebraska, about 0900, with a planned destination of Kimball, Nebraska.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed.
The pilot reported that the winds at the time of the accident were from the northwest at 25 gusting to 30 knots.
He experienced engine power fluctuations.
When he scanned the engine gauges, he observed no fuel pressure indication.
He reported the gas generator was fluctuating and the turbine temperature was "OK."  He set up for a forced landing, and the engine lost power.
He maneuvered over a set of powerlines and the airplane nosed over during the landing attempt, sustaining substantial damage.
The wreckage was examined by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airworthiness Inspector.
He reported that the wreckage was moved prior to his arrival.
Sufficient fuel was on board, gravity feed fuel flow to the firewall was verified, and the vent system was checked.
He reported no evidence of preimpact airframe malfunction.
The engine was transported to Dallas, Texas, and examined.
The FAA Aviation Safety Inspector, who observed the examination, reported significant impact damage, minor rotational damage, and no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunction.
The low pressure fuel pump exhibited "major" impact damage and could not be tested.
Partial disassembly revealed no internal damage.
