He said that he was unable to arrest the bounced landing and the airplane exited the runway.
A ground witness told the deputy that the airplane landed normally on the snow-covered runway, but during the landing roll, the airplane "got squirrely" and the airplane veered off the north side of the runway.
The pilot applied power and initiated a takeoff.
The airplane momentarily became airborne, but its right wing dropped and struck the ground.
The airplane spun to the right and came to rest on the ground.

The accident occurred on the third landing.
The pilot said in the aircraft accident report that on the third landing the winds unexpectedly changed and he was unable to avoid stalling the airplane at 30 feet above the ground.
The airplane landed hard on the median area north of the runway and south of the taxiway.
