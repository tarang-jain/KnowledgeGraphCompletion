Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: BONHAM, TX
Accident Number: FTW95LA375
Date & Time: 09/01/1995, 1500 CDT
Registration: N5798J
Aircraft: CESSNA 172N
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 2 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The flight's destination was a farm near Bonham.
During a low approach over the farm field, the pilot decided to abort the landing and go to Jones Field.
During the aborted landing, a partial loss of engine power occurred.
As the airplane descended toward a barn and trees, the pilot banked the airplane to the left and missed the barn.
The left wing struck trees and the airplane impacted the ground coming to rest inverted.
During an engine test run throughout a range of power settings, no mechanical discrepancies were found.
The pilot reported a 102 degree (F) temperature, an altimeter setting of 30.00, and a site elevation of 600 feet.
Utilizing this data, the calculated density altitude exceeded 3,000 feet.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: THE PARTIAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS.
FACTORS WERE THE HIGH DENSITY ALTITUDE AND LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN FOR THE FORCED LANDING.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF ENGINE POWER(PARTIAL) - NONMECHANICAL Phase of Operation: GO-AROUND (VFR) Findings 1.
(C) REASON FOR OCCURRENCE UNDETERMINED ---------- Occurrence #2: FORCED LANDING Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY DESCENT/LANDING ---------- Occurrence #3: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH OBJECT Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY DESCENT/LANDING Findings 2.
(F) WEATHER CONDITION - HIGH DENSITY ALTITUDE 3.
(F) TERRAIN CONDITION - NONE SUITABLE 4.
OBJECT - BUILDING(NONRESIDENTIAL) 5.
OBJECT - TREE(S) Factual Information On September 1, 1995, at 1500 central daylight time, a Cessna 172N, N5798J, collided with trees during an aborted landing near Bonham, Texas.
The private pilot and one passenger received minor injuries and the other passenger was not injured.
The airplane sustained substantial damage.
Centerline Aviation operated the airplane under Title 14 CFR Part 91.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal cross country flight and a flight plan was not filed.
The pilot reported that the flight had departed Addison, Texas, approximately 1420, en route to a farm near Bonham.
During a low approach over the farm field, the pilot decided to abort the landing and go to Jones Field at Bonham.
When the pilot "pushed in [the] throttle, plane sputtered then resumed power."
On climb out, the airplane "sputtered again."
From 80 to 90 feet above the ground, the airplane descended to 30 to 50 feet toward a barn and trees.
With the airplane continuing the descent, the pilot banked the airplane to the left and missed the barn; however, the left wing struck trees and the airplane impacted the ground coming to rest nose down.
Structural damage occurred to the firewall, right wing, and fuselage.
An engine test run (sheet enclosed) was conducted in the presence of the owner's representative and the FAA inspector.
Throughout a range of power settings, no mechanical discrepancies were found.
The pilot reported a Fahrenheit temperature of 102 degrees, an altimeter setting of 30.00 inches, and the site elevation as 600 feet.
Utilizing this data, the calculated density altitude exceeded 3,000 feet.
Pilot Information Certificate: Private Age: 28, Male Airplane Rating(s): Single-engine Land Seat Occupied: Left Other Aircraft Rating(s): None Restraint Used: Seatbelt, Shoulder harness Instrument Rating(s): None Second Pilot Present: Yes Instructor Rating(s): None Toxicology Performed: No Medical Certification: Class 3 Valid Medical--w/ waivers/lim.
