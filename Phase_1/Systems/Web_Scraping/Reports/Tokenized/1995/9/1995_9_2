OBJECT - TREE(S) Factual Information On September 1, 1995, at 1115 eastern daylight time, a Grumman AA-5, N9528L, was destroyed when it impacted the terrain during an attempted go around at the Welke Airport, Saint James, Michigan.
The private pilot and one passenger reported minor injuries.
The personal flight originated in Three Rivers, Michigan, about 0830, and was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91 in visual meteorological conditions.
No flight plan was filed.
The pilot reported that the left fuel gage was not working and both fuel tanks were full prior to departure.
He did not lean the engine during the flight and used fuel from the right tank for approximately one hour.
He switched to the left tank for the remaining 1.7 hours of the flight.
The pilot initiated a go around during an attempted landing on runway 17.
When the airplane was at an altitude of about 50 feet, the engine lost power.
The pilot attempted to land the airplane on the remaining runway.
The airplane departed the runway at the departure end and "slid into the trees."
Examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector revealed both fuel tanks were ruptured.
A "trace" of fuel remained in the right tank.
The left tank was empty.
No fuel remained in the fuel lines and about 3/8 inch of fuel remained in the carburetor bowl.
An inspection cover in the outboard section of the left fuel tank and the quick drain in the right fuel tank were stained a red color.
