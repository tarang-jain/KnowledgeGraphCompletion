He stated that the first indication of trouble was an unusual noise in the engine compartment, followed by a drop in fuel pressure.
He stated that after the fuel pressure dropped, and the engine began to run rough, he switched to the right fuel tank.
He stated that the engine continued to run rough, and that the engine eventually lost all power.
He attempted an emergency landing on a highway.
