 Analysis During takeoff, the airplane experienced a total loss of engine power.
The pilot maneuvered the airplane to avoid traffic.
As a result, the airspeed became too low and the descent rate could not be stopped.
The airplane slid off the paved roadway into a ravine.
Postaccident examination revealed the engine had low compression in one of the two cylinders.
The pilot stated he thought the loss of power resulted from an ignition problem.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: a loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.
A factor related to the accident was the presence of traffic requiring the pilot to perform an evasive maneuver.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF ENGINE POWER Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - INITIAL CLIMB Findings 1.
MISCELLANEOUS,ENGINE - LOW COMPRESSION 2.
(C) REASON FOR OCCURRENCE UNDETERMINED ---------- Occurrence #2: FORCED LANDING Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY LANDING AFTER TAKEOFF ---------- Occurrence #3: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY LANDING AFTER TAKEOFF Findings 3.
(F) OBJECT - VEHICLE 4.
EVASIVE MANEUVER - PERFORMED - PILOT IN COMMAND 5.
The pilot reported minor injuries.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.
The personal 14 CFR Part 91 flight was not operating on a flight plan.
From the pilot's written statement, the airplane made a normal takeoff, at approximately 300 feet the engine lost total power.
After an unsuccessful restart, the pilot attempted to land on a paved road.
The pilot stated, "...glide was extended to avoid traffic.
As a result, the airspeed was too low and descent rate could not be arrested ...
."
The airplane came to rest in a ravine alongside the road.
Post accident examination of the airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI), revealed low compression on one out of the two cylinders.
The pilot/owner believes the problem might have been an ignition problem.
