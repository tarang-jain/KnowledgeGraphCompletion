Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: COLLINSVILLE, OK
Accident Number: FTW96LA068
Date & Time: 12/02/1995, 1400 CST
Registration: N236CD
Aircraft: AVIAT A-1
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot reported that while approaching his private airstrip to land, he reduced the engine power to idle, 'pulled on the carburetor heat,' and glided for 3 to 5 minutes.
He also reported that he never 'cleared his engine' during this glide.
Subsequently, he realized the approach would be 'short' and that additional power would be needed to reach the airstrip.
He moved the throttle forward, but there was no increased power response.
The pilot further stated that the airplane was very low to the ground, and there was not enough room to maneuver.
During a forced landing, the airplane impacted transmission wires and then the ground.
The temperature and dew point were 75 and 53 degrees, respectively.
According to icing probability charts, conditions were favorable for carburetor ice.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's improper planning/decision, his failure to periodically clear the engine during the glide, and failure to see-and-avoid the transmission line during the approach for an emergency landing.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF ENGINE POWER(TOTAL) - NONMECHANICAL Phase of Operation: APPROACH Findings 1.
(C) PLANNING/DECISION - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND 2.
WEATHER CONDITION - CARBURETOR ICING CONDITIONS 3.
CARBURETOR HEAT - SELECTED - PILOT IN COMMAND 4.
(C) POWERPLANT CONTROLS - IMPROPER USE OF - PILOT IN COMMAND ---------- Occurrence #2: FORCED LANDING Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY DESCENT/LANDING ---------- Occurrence #3: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH OBJECT Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY LANDING Findings 5.
OBJECT - WIRE,TRANSMISSION 6.
The private pilot sustained minor injuries.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the cross country flight that originated at Vinita, Oklahoma, approximately 45 minutes before the accident.
No flight plan was filed.
The pilot reported in his Pilot/Operator Report and during a telephonic interview with the investigator-in-charge that he was approaching his private airstrip to land.
He reduced the engine power to idle, pulled on the carburetor heat, and glided for 3 to 5 minutes during the approach for landing (the pilot reported that he never "cleared his engine" during this glide).
He realized that he was "short", and needed power to make the airstrip.
He moved the throttle forward and there was no increased power response.
The pilot further stated that he was very low to the ground and had no room to maneuver.
During the forced landing, the airplane impacted transmission wires and the ground.
Evaluation of the weather, at the time of the accident, revealed a temperature of 75 degrees and dew point of 53 degrees.
The enclosed icing probability curve chart indicates that this float type carbureted engine was being operated in a region of serious carburetor icing conditions.
