 Analysis The student pilot had planned to practice stop-and-go landings on runway 34.
He said the airplane touched down on all three wheels simultaneously, because he did not flare sufficiently.
The left main and nose wheel came up, but instead of going around, he pushed the nose down.
The airplane began to veer to the left, and the student corrected by applying right rudder.
When the left main wheel contacted the runway, the airplane veered further to the left.
The student applied additional right rudder retracted the flaps and added power to abort the landing.
