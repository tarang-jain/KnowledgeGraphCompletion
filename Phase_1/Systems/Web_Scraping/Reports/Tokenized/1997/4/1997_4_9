 Analysis After reviewing the flight planning, the flight instructor (CFI) approved the student pilot's solo cross-country flight.
The student then departed on the cross-country flight for his destination, which was 110 miles away.
The student said he found some of his check points, but after the planned elapsed time, he could not find the airport.
He continued to search, and did not use his radio for assistance.
The student became disoriented, and the airplane was tracked on radar into Class 'B' airspace, until it impacted the ground about 2 miles from an international airport.
The student  reported he was forced to land 'after running out of fuel' about 85 miles west of his destination.
The airplane manual stated there were 3.5 gallons of unusable fuel.
About 2.5 gallons of fuel were drained from the airplane.

The Inspector reported that the pilot landed up slope on hilly, rough terrain.
The nose landing gear and strut were broken off and lying on the ground near the initial impact point.
The firewall was bent upward approximately 2 inches and the right wing tip leading edge was crushed causing spar damage and buckling at the wing root.
Flaps were found at the 35 degree position.
