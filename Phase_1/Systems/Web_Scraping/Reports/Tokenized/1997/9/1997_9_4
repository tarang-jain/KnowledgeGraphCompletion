The pilot stated to the inspector that upon landing at 110 knots airspeed, he was unable to stop, when full brakes were applied, before departing the end of the wet runway.
A witness, at the accident site, stated that he saw the airplane "well high on the final approach glidepath", and that the airplane landed "very fast" and touched down " about mid field".
The FAA inspector stated, that after the airplane departed the end of the wet runway, it rolled down an embankment collapsing the nose gear, damaging the inboard structure of the left wing ribs, and the nose gear bulk head on the right side.
The inspector found skid marks on the runway, and no mechanical or system malfunctions were identified during the wreckage examination.
Runway 36 was 3800 feet in length and made of asphalt.
The runway conditions for that day were 84 degrees Fahrenheit and light rain.
According to the pilots operating handbook for the Beech 95-A55, the estimated landing roll for this airplane, at 84 degree Fahrenheit temperature, normal approach speed of 87 knots, and under dry conditions would be 1,650 ft.
