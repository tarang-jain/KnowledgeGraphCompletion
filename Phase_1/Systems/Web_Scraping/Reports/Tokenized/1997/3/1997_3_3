Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: PARKER, AZ
Accident Number: LAX97LA118
Date & Time: 03/01/1997, 0815 MST
Registration: N9033H
Aircraft: Balloon Works AX-8B
Aircraft Damage: None
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 Serious, 2 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis After about 15 minutes on a 'Hare and Hound' flight, the pilot noticed a drop in fuel pressure (while flying at a low altitude).
He switched fuel tanks, but the balloon had begun to descend.
The pilot attempted to stop the descent by using a good tank, but the balloon continued to lose altitude and landed hard on flat terrain, before the descent could be stopped.
The pilot and other pilots reported low level wind shear in the area at the time.
No mechanical malfunction was reported.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the pilot's inadequate in-flight planning, which resulted in an excessive descent and subsequent hard landing, due to a drop in fuel pressure along with shifting winds at low altitude.
Findings Occurrence #1: ALTITUDE DEVIATION,UNCONTROLLED Phase of Operation: MANEUVERING Findings 1.
(C) IN-FLIGHT PLANNING/DECISION - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND 2.
(F) FUEL SYSTEM,TANK - LOW PRESSURE 3.
(F) FUEL MANAGEMENT - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND ---------- Occurrence #2: FORCED LANDING Phase of Operation: DESCENT ---------- Occurrence #3: HARD LANDING Phase of Operation: LANDING Findings 4.
TERRAIN CONDITION - OPEN FIELD 5.
(F) WEATHER CONDITION - SUDDEN WINDSHIFT Factual Information On March 1, 1997, at 0815 hours mountain standard time, a Balloon Works AX-8B, N9033H, owned and operated by the pilot, collided with the ground near Parker, Arizona, during a local pleasure flight.
The balloon was not damaged and the pilot and one of two passengers onboard were not injured.
The other passenger received a serious injury to the ankle.
Visual meteorological conditions existed at the time.
According to the pilot, after 15 minutes of flight, he noticed a drop in fuel pressure and switched to another tank with the balloon making a corresponding drop in altitude and change in direction.
A continuous application of the burner blast valve did not stop the rate of descent and a hard landing occurred.
The pilot stated that the loss of the propane fuel pressure in the number 2 tank just prior to the changeover to the number 4 tank, along with a wind shear, caused the balloon to collide with the ground.
Wind shears were reported by several balloonists upon debriefing their flights later that morning.
The pilot operator report did not indicate a mechanical malfunction or failure.
