 Analysis The flight instructor (CFI) and private pilot had reviewed airwork, turns, stalls, slow flight, take off and landings.
They elected to practice procedures for a simulated engine failure.
According to the CFI, 'on go-around, engine failed to produce power, resulting in forced landing....'  The FAA inspector stated that during the approach, they were at a fast landing speed and high on the approach.
At an altitude of about 100 feet above the ground, they attempted to go around and advanced the throttle, but the engine did not respond.
