 Analysis Shortly after takeoff in gusty winds, the forward baggage door opened.
The pilot attempted to return to the airport when the airplane impacted trees and descended into the river.
The passengers stated the airplane was at a low altitude, the wings were rocking left and right, and a buzzer was sounding just before the accident.
One passenger stated to his knowledge the baggage door was latched, but not locked prior to takeoff.
Inspection of the baggage door latch after the accident showed it was in the latched position.
No failure of the latch was noted which would have resulted in it opening during the flight.
The takeoff was performed on runway 16 and the winds were from 210 degrees at 13 knots, gusting to 21 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed which resulted in a stall.
Related factors were the pilot's diverted attention and gusty wind conditions.

Witnesses reported that the forward baggage door opened during the takeoff.
The pilot and two passengers sustained fatal injuries.
One passenger sustained serious injuries and one sustained minor injuries.
The 14 CFR Part 91 business flight was destined for Fort Dodge, Iowa.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an IFR flight plan was filed.
One of the passengers stated he arrived at the airplane around 0630 cdt.
He stated the airplane was already out and the pilot and passenger doors were open.
He reported the forward baggage door was closed and the pilot went into the hangar to get the key.
They opened the baggage door and put a briefcase in.
The same passenger stated that since not all the passengers were there yet he decided to make some telephone calls on his cell phone which was in the briefcase.
He stated he made the calls and he put the briefcase back in the baggage area once again.
He stated he thinks he closed and latched the baggage door, but he was not sure.
He reported that he did not "double latch" the door because he knew others were coming and figured they would have baggage to stow.
He stated the pilot then went into the hangar to answer the telephone and he went to use the facilities.
When he returned the other passengers had arrived at which time they entered the airplane.
The passenger stated he was in the front right seat for takeoff.
The pilot started the engine and did the "mag checks" and everything was normal.
He stated they departed to the south and at an altitude of about 50 feet above the ground the front cargo door opened and stayed "straight up" the entire time.
The pilot stated they would have to go back and land.
The passenger stated the airplane seemed to "wallow" as they climbed and likened it to landing in a strong crosswind.
According to the passenger, the pilot made a comment about needing to turn the airplane into the wind at which time the pilot initiated a turn to the left.
The passenger stated the airplane motion became more erratic as they climbed.
He stated the pilot raised the gear and he recalled hearing a buzzer going off.
The pilot then moved the flap handle and stated "...we're going in."
He stated the right side of the airplane then contacted the trees and the airplane descended into the water.
He stated the green water filled the airplane followed by darkness.
The passenger reported he unlatched his seat belt and felt around thinking he needed to go to the right.
He stated his shoulder harness was still catching and after he freed it he was able to exit the airplane.
The other surviving passenger reported that it was turbulent and after takeoff the wings were rocking left to right.
He stated he heard a couple of "buzzers" go off, but he wasn't alarmed as he had heard them before when flying in this airplane.
He reported they flew over powerlines and noticed the altitude was low.
He stated the nose was higher then normal and the pilot was fighting with the controls because of the turbulence.
He reported that at this point, he felt they were going to crash.
He reported the airplane impacted trees along the river then dove into the water in a 45 degree nose down attitude.
This passenger reported the engine sounded normal until the airplane impacted the trees.
He exited the airplane through a broken window.
