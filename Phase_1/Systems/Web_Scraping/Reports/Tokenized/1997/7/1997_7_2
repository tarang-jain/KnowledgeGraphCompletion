The commercial pilot reported no injuries.
The 14 CFR Part 137 aerial application flight was not operating on a flight plan.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.
The flight departed Satanta, Kansas, at 2025 cdt.
Post accident examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI), stated that the pilot reported that about two miles from the departure airport the engine backfired and lost power causing an emergency landing.
The airplane's fuel system was inspected and the fuel tanks were empty due to rupture in the fuel line caused when the airplane ground looped and settled on the top of the upper wing.
The fuel strainer was inspected and held clean aviation 100LL fuel (blue in color).
The fuel line was repaired and fuel was added to the wing tanks for the engine test run.
The forward spark plugs were removed and cleaned and oil which had run into the cylinders when the airplane was inverted was allowed to drain.
The existing propeller was removed and a serviceable propeller installed for the test run on the airplane.
The propeller was pulled through to clear all the cylinders of oil.
The engine was then motored over with the starter and after several attempts the engine started.
The engine ran rough until it burned the remainder of the oil out of the cylinders and warmed up.
The engine was then ran at 2100 rpm's and produced 32 inches of manifold pressure.
There were no mechanical or backfiring problems discovered during the test run.
The pilot did not submit the required National Transportation Safety Board's form 6120.1/2 under Title 49, Part 830.15.
