Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot extended the landing gear 3 to 4 miles prior to landing.
During the landing flare the landing gear warning horn sounded.
The pilot reported that it was too late to initiate a go- around so he continued the landing during which the landing gear collapsed.
Postaccident testing of the landing gear system revealed the hydraulic pump circuit breaker would pop when the landing gear was extended.
This resulted in the gear being in a trailing unlocked position.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the circuit breaker for the hydraulic pump popped during gear extension which resulting in the failure of the landing gear to lock in the extended position.
