The airplane collided with wires and terrain and a postcrash fire ensued.
Examination of the airframe and flight controls revealed no evidence of a precrash mechanical failure or malfunction.
Disassembly of the engine assembly revealed no precrash anomalies or discrepancies that would indicate the engine was not capable of running and producing power before the accident.
