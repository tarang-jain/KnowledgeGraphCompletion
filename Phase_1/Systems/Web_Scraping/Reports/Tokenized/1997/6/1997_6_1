Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: HEALY, AK
Accident Number: ANC97LA081
Date & Time: 06/01/1997, 1825 AKD
Registration: N3602A
Aircraft: Piper PA-22
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot was departing in a tailwheel equipped airplane from a runway that was located along and above a small creek.
A right crosswind of about 8 knots was prevailing at the airport.
During the takeoff roll, the right wing began to rise.
Full right aileron control did not prevent the right wing from continuing to rise.
The airplane departed off the left edge of the runway and became airborne.
It then stalled and descended about 75 ft to the ground in a near nose level attitude.
The airplane received damage to the left wing, fuselage, and landing gear.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions, and failure to maintain directional control of the airplane and runway alignment.
Factors relating to the accident were: the crosswind, and the proximity of a creek (ravine) to the runway.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - ON GROUND/WATER Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - ROLL/RUN Findings 1.
(F) WEATHER CONDITION - CROSSWIND 2.
(C) COMPENSATION FOR WIND CONDITIONS - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND 3.
(C) DIRECTIONAL CONTROL - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND 4.
(C) PROPER ALIGNMENT - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND ---------- Occurrence #2: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: OTHER Findings 5.
(F) TERRAIN CONDITION - RAVINE Factual Information On June 1, 1997, about 1825 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Piper PA-22, N3602A, crashed during takeoff at the Healy River Airport, Healy, Alaska.
The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country personal flight when the accident occurred.
The airplane, registered to and operated by the pilot, sustained substantial damage.
The certificated private pilot, the sole occupant, received minor injuries.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, Fairbanks Flight Standards District Office (FSDO), reported the airplane was departing runway 15.
Skid marks on the runway indicated the airplane departed the left side of the runway, down an embankment.
The airplane came to rest about 75 feet below the level of the runway.
On June 3, 1997, at 1345, in a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC), the pilot reported he started the takeoff with a right quartering headwind of about 5 knots.
He noticed a dark cloud about 1 mile to the west of the airport.
During the takeoff roll, the right wing began to rise.
Full right aileron control could not prevent the right wing from continuing to rise.
The airplane was pushed to the left, off the edge of the runway.
The airplane then stalled, and descended to the ground in a near nose level attitude.
The airplane received damage to the left wing, fuselage, and landing gear.
The closest official weather observation station is Healy, Alaska.
The NTSB pilot/operator report (NTSB form 6120.1/2) was not returned by the pilot.
