Location: Medford, OR
Accident Number: SEA05CA003
Date & Time: 10/01/2004, 1705 PDT
Registration: N2849Z
Aircraft: Piper PA-22/20
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot was practicing touch-and-go landings in crosswind conditions, and during his first landing there was a 40 degree crosswind at five knots.
As he was cleared for his second landing, the tower advised him that the wind had changed direction and speed, and he was therefore landing in a 60 degree crosswind of seven knots.
During his second landing, he relaxed his "cross control input" too much during the landing flare, and the aircraft's left wing began to lift.
He therefore elected to execute a go-around, but as he added power the aircraft began rotating to the left.
He therefore elected to try to put the aircraft back onto the runway, but as it touched down, the aircraft was not aligned with the runway, and it therefore quickly veered to the left.
As the aircraft departed the side of the runway, the tip of its right wing came in contact with the terrain resulting in substantial damage to the wings internal structure.
According to the pilot, there was nothing wrong with the aircraft, and the accident was simply a result of his failure to adequately control the aircraft in the crosswind conditions.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's inadequate compensation for crosswind conditions during landing, resulting in his failure to maintain directional control.
Factors include the presence of crosswinds.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - ON GROUND/WATER Phase of Operation: LANDING - FLARE/TOUCHDOWN Findings 1.
(C) COMPENSATION FOR WIND CONDITIONS - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND 2.
(C) DIRECTIONAL CONTROL - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND 3.
(F) WEATHER CONDITION - CROSSWIND ---------- Occurrence #2: ON GROUND/WATER ENCOUNTER WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: LANDING - ROLL Findings 4.
