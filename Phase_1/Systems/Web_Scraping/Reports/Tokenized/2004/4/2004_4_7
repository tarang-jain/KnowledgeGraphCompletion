The pilot attempted a forced landing to an open field near the east shore of the lake.
During the forced landing, the airplane's right wing struck several branches on the top of a 50-foot tree near the edge of the field.
The airplane spun to the right, approximately 180 degrees, and struck the ground in a nose-down attitude approximately 100 feet southeast of the tree.
