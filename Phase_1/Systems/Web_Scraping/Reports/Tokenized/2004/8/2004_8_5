 Analysis During landing on runway 18 at an uncontrolled airfield, a Cessna 140 collided with an amateur built Rose Parakeet A-1 biplane that landed on runway 36 and was taxiing to the end of the runway.
Four other airplanes involved in the fly-in had previously landed on runway 36 prior to the collision.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain visual lookout for other aircraft while landing.
Findings Occurrence #1: COLLISION BETWEEN AIRCRAFT (OTHER THAN MIDAIR) Phase of Operation: LANDING Findings 1.
The Cessna 140 was registered to Ray's Used Equipment of Nocona, Texas, and operated by the pilot.
The Rose Parakeet A-1 was registered to and operated by the pilot.
Neither of the two private pilots were injured.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and flight plans were not filed for either flight.
Both airplanes were operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as personal flights.
The cross-country flights for both airplanes originated from Fairview Airport (7TS0), near Rhome, Texas, at 0750.
The 4,032-hour pilot of the Parakeet A-1biplane reported in the Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB Form 6120.1/2) that prior to landing on runway 36, he observed four other airplanes using runway 36 as the active runway.
The pilot further stated that after landing on runway 36, he taxied down the remaining 500 feet of the runway to exit at the parking area adjacent to the departure end of runway 36, as he was looking out of both sides of the cockpit.
When approximately 300 feet from the departure end of the runway, "an explosion from the right wing occurred."
The pilot stated his airplane rotated to the right, as he noticed a yellow airplane on the grass adjacent to the runway facing south.
The 3,600-hour pilot of the Cessna 140 failed to complete and return an NTSB Form 6120.1/2, as he was requested.
The witness also stated that the bright yellow Cessna 140 was slightly off the ground when the two airplanes collided.
The Lake Texoma State Park Airport (F31) features a single (18/36) asphalt runway, 3,000 feet long by 50 feet wide.
The airfield is uncontrolled (non-towered) and operates under class G airspace.
The common traffic advisory frequency is 122.8 megahertz.
Examination of the Cessna 140 by the FAA inspector revealed that the right wing spar was bent and the leading edge was structurally damaged.
The right aileron was severed.
Examination of Parakeet A-1 biplane revealed that the upper and lower right wings sustained damage and were separated from the fuselage.
