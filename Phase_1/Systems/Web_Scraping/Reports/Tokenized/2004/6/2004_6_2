AIDS TO NAVIAGATION The OWA Instrument landing system runway 30 (ILS RWY 30) approach depicted TONNA, a nondirectional radio beacon, as the approach's locater outer marker / instrument approach fix located 5 nautical miles on a course of 302 degrees to runway 30.
The TONNA frequency was depicted as 379 kilohertz (kHz).
The initial and intermediate segment altitudes were 2,900 feet mean sea level (MSL) and the description height for all categories of aircraft was 1,345 feet MSL or 200 feet AGL and 1/2 statute mile visibility.
The ILS RWY 30 approach lists only FARMINGTON VOR, located 33.5 NM on a 172 degree course to TONNA, and ROCHESTER VOR located 29.9 NM on a 302 degree course to TONNA.
The VOR / DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) RWY 30 approach lists only HALFWAY VOR.
A flight inspection of the OWA ILS RWY 30 was conducted on June 2, 2004, by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
The Flight Inspection Report -  Instrument Landing System stated that "facility operation found satisfactory."
AIRPORT INFORMATION OWA has an airport elevation of 1,146 feet MSL and is equipped with runway 12-30 (5,500 feet by 100 feet, concrete) and is served by VOR/DME and ILS approaches to runway 30.
Runway 30 is equipped with a medium intensity approach light system with a runway alignment system and runway alignment indicator lights.
Lighting for runway 12-30 consists of high intensity pilot controlled lighting, runway 12 has pilot controlled runway end identifier lights, and runway 30 has runway end identifier lights.
Both runways are equipped with 4-identical light unit precision approach path indictor lighting systems.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION The wreckage area was located in an agricultural field about 4.36 nautical miles and 301 degrees from OWA at the following Global Positioning System Coordinates: 44 degrees 04.789 minutes North, 093 degree 09.918 minutes West, elevation of 1,267 feet MSL.
The wreckage path, which was about 1,900 feet in length and oriented on a magnetic direction of 160 degrees, consisted of a damaged house, trees, and airplane wreckage.
The damaged house had a 3-foot wide swath of roof damage that contained pieces of the airplane's left wing.
A 10 foot by 5 foot by 4 foot deep ground scar contained the propeller, which was separated from the engine and buried within the ground scar.
Both propeller blades exhibited S-shaped bending, twisting, and chordwise scoring.
The engine and nose section of the airplane was located several feet southeast of the ground scar.
Both wing fuel bladders were broken open and a smell consistent with aviation fuel was present at the accident site.
The fuel selector contained a liquid consistent in color and smell to 100 low lead aviation fuel, and the selector was between the off and the left fuel tank positions.
The flight control system was destroyed and all control surfaces were located along in the wreckage area.
Inspection of the aileron, elevator, rudder, and flap control cables exhibited necking consistent with ductile fracture; no worn or abraded areas were noted at these areas.
The trim tab actuator was separated from its mounting surface and was extended approximately 2.2 inches, which equates to a 25-degree tab up (nose down position).
The flap jack screw was extended about 0.5 inches, which equates to a flap position of 0-5 degrees.
The engine driven vacuum pump was attached to the engine and removed for inspection.
The inspection revealed that the vacuum pump drive shaft was intact and the drive shaft gearing was undamaged.
The attitude indicator and directional indicator gyros were moved by hand about their gimbals without binding.
Both gyros were then disassembled and noted to have circumferential scoring on the gyro and interior gyro housing.
The instrument panel exhibited impact damage.
The tachometer gauge indicated approximately 2,900 rpm and a tachometer time of 2,048.4 hours.
The altimeter indicated approximately 1,100 feet MSL and the altimeter's setting window indicated 29.68 inches of mercury.
The automatic direction finder receiver indicated a frequency of 379 kHz.
The ignition switch was in the "Both" position.
The "Stby Vac" control knob was in the full forward position.
The engine components and accessories were intact except for the fuel pump, oil filter, and vacuum pump.
The fuel metering unit was connected by a fuel line.
The oil sump was crushed and the number six cylinder head was crushed and deformed in the aft direction.
The left side intake and exhaust pipes were separated and the forward section of the oil sump was separated.
Both forward sections of the crankcase halves were crushed to the aft area of the number six cylinder attachment point.
The crankshaft was separated aft of the propeller attachment flange.
The oil filter was opened and inspection of the filter element revealed an absence of metallic debris.
The left magneto was broken in half and the rear half was missing.
The right magneto exhibited impacted damage and could not be rotated by hand.
The top spark plugs, Champion RHB-32E, were removed and displayed a color about their electrodes consistent with normal wear as depicted in the Champion Aviation Check-A-Plug Card.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION Autopsies of the pilot and pilot-rated passenger were conducted by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office on June 3, 2004.
The FAA's Final Forensic Toxicology Fatal Accident Report of the pilot reported that no ethanol and no listed drugs were detected in muscle.
The FAA's Final Forensic Toxicology Fatal Accident Report of the pilot-rated passenger states: 16 (mg/dL, mg/hg) ethanol and 6 (mg/dL, mg/hg) acetaldehyde detected in muscle.
The report notes: the ethanol found in this case is potentially from postmortem ethanol formation and not from the ingestion of ethanol.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION The FAA, Cessna Aircraft, and Teledyne Continental Motors were parties to the investigation.
Pilot Information Certificate: Private Age: 50, Male Airplane Rating(s): Multi-engine Land; Single-engine Land Seat Occupied: Unknown Other Aircraft Rating(s): None Restraint Used: Instrument Rating(s): Airplane Second Pilot Present: Yes Instructor Rating(s): None Toxicology Performed: Yes Medical Certification: Class 2 Valid Medical--w/ waivers/lim.
