 Analysis According to both pilots, after landing, the airplane was cleared to taxi to the north ramp.
Both pilots stated that the CFI in the left seat took control of the airplane in order to position and park it.
The pilot in control of the airplane at the time of the accident, CFI- left, stated, "while pushing the left rudder, [his] foot slipped down and off the [left] pedal."
He stated that he then immediately "pushed full left rudder, but the right wing... hit one of the corner metal poles."
The pilot not in control of the airplane at the time of the accident, CFI-right, stated that as the pilot in control "was beginning to set-up the aircraft's turn, his foot immediately slipped off of the rudder.
This caused the aircraft's wing to hit a fence pole."
