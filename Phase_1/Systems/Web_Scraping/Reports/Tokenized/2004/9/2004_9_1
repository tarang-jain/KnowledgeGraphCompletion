 Analysis The pilot stated that he was not aware of the wet runway condition on the grass/sod runway surface prior to arriving at his destination airport.
The pilot further stated that the active runway was orientated on a 020-degree magnetic heading, and the grass/sod surface was about 3000 feet long and 200 feet wide.
The pilot also said, because of the 150-foot tall trees on the approach end of the runway, he established a steeper approach angle and faster approach speed than the normal profile for touchdown.
According to the pilot the airplane touched down about 500 feet beyond the approach end of the runway.
After landing the pilot recalled that airplane braking was not effective, and stated that the airplane began to "hydroplane", and he was not able to stop the airplane.
The airplane continued off the departure end of the sod runway collided with a fence, and came to rest on Brunswick Highway in Waycross.
