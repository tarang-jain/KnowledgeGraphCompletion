Registration: N421SD
Aircraft: Cessna 421B
Aircraft Damage: Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries: 5 Fatal, 1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Business
 Analysis The airline transport pilot (ATP) stated the airplane was between 200 to 300 feet on initial takeoff climb when the right engine lost power and the airplane yawed to the right.
The pilot lowered the nose of the airplane to gain airspeed, pulled the right power lever rearward and nothing happened.
The pilot did not feather the right propeller and started moving switches in the vicinity of the boost pump switches.
The ATP passenger stated, he did not think the left engine was producing full power.
He scanned the instruments with his eyes looking at the manifold pressure gauges.
"One needle was at zero and the other was at 25-inches.
The manifold pressure should have been 39-inches of manifold pressure.
The ATP passenger observed trees to their front and thought the pilot was trying to make a forced landing in an open field to their left.
The ATP passenger realized the airplane was going to collide with the trees.
Just before the airplane collided with the trees, the pilot feathered the right engine.
The ATP passenger observed the right propeller going into the feather position, and the propeller came to a complete stop.
Examination of the right engine revealed no anomalies.
Examination of the left engine revealed the starter adapter gear teeth had failed due to overload.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's improper identification of a partial loss of engine power on initial takeoff climb resulting in a collision with trees and the ground.
A factor was a partial failure of the left engine starter adapter due to overload.

(F) 1 ENGINE 2.
(F) ENGINE ACCESSORIES,ENGINE STARTER - OVERLOAD ---------- Occurrence #2: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: DESCENT - EMERGENCY Findings 3.
OBJECT - TREE(S) 4.
(C) EMERGENCY PROCEDURE - IMPROPER - PILOT IN COMMAND 5.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed.
The flight plan was not activated.
The airplane was destroyed and there was a post-crash fire.
The commercial pilot, and four passengers were fatally injured.
The airline transport pilot-rated passenger (ATP) reported serious injuries.
The flight originated from Collegedale Municipal Airport, Collegedale, Tennessee, on December 2, 2004, at 1318.
The ATP passenger seated in the right front cockpit seat stated the pilot departed from runway 03 without completing an engine run-up.
The airplane was between 200 to 300 feet on initial takeoff climb when the right engine lost power and the airplane yawed to the right.
The pilot lowered the nose of the airplane to gain airspeed, pulled the right power lever rearward and nothing happened.
The pilot did not feather the right propeller and started moving switches in the vicinity of the boost pump switches.
At one point the ATP passenger stated, he did not think the left engine was producing full power.
He scanned the instruments with his eyes looking at the manifold pressure gauges.
"One needle was at zero and the other was at 25- inches.
The manifold pressure should have been 39-inches of manifold pressure.
I assumed the zero reading on the manifold pressure was the right engine.ï¬‚ The ATP passenger observed trees to their front and thought the pilot was trying to make a forced landing in an open field to their left.
The ATP passenger thought the airplane would skim the top of the trees and they would be able to complete the forced landing to the open field.
He then realized the airplane was going to collide with the trees.
Just before the airplane hit the trees, the pilot feathered the right engine.
The ATP passenger observed the right propeller going into the feather position, and the propeller came to a complete stop.
As soon as the airplane came to a stop he observed he pilot slumped over in his seat, and then observed the airplane was on fire.
He immediately exited the airplane, and departed the crash site seeking assistance.
A witness stated he was walking in his front yard when he heard an airplane approaching. "
The engine sounded like it was surging."
The airplane approached his home from the south going north, and was located above the tee line.
The witness observed the airplane make a left bank estimated at 20-degres degrees.
The airplane disappeared from view behind the trees and smoldering smoke pursued.
The witness called the emergency 911 operators, and notified them of the accident.
He then observed an individual coming from the direction of the crash site and saw a ball of fire when the airplane exploded.
Another witness who lives near the airport stated he and his wife were in their home when they heard an airplane approaching.
He assumed that the airplane had departed from Collegedale Municipal Airport.
The airplane sounded like a twin-engine airplane and it sounded as if the airplane was flying low.
He went outside and observed the airplane flying towards him.
The left engine was turning but he could not see propeller blades as if it was idling, and the engine sounded like a Harley engine.
The right engine was not running.
It appeared the pilot was trying to start the right engine.
The propeller would turn and stop.
It did this about two times.
The airplane was about 100 feet high and was descending fast.
The airplane was observed to start a left turn towards an open field in the vicinity of Pine Hill Road and McDonald Road.
The witness stated he knew the airplane was in trouble and he told his wife that the airplane was going to crash.
The airplane disappeared from view and he heard it hit the ground and subsequently observed smoke rising in the general area of Pine Hill Road and McDonald Road.
He called the airport to report the accident and his neighbor called the 911 emergency operators.
