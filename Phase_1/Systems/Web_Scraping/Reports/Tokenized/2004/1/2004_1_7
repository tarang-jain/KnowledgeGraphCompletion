Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: Fishers, IN
Accident Number: CHI04LA052
Date & Time: 01/02/2004, 1420 EST
Registration: N21992
Aircraft: Piper PA-32RT-300
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 4 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The airplane sustained substantial damage on impact with trees during a circling instrument approach.
The pilot stated, "Descended to 1340 msl [mean sea level] and continued to 20 DME but did not clear clouds.
Descended to 1100 msl and broke through at south end of runway.
Remained clear of clouds and entered left, downwind circling approach to rwy [runway] 15 and proceeded with circling north entry.
Clipped uppermost small branches of a tree with left wing in the middle of the turn, pulled aircraft higher for clearance and continued approx 1/4 to 1/2 mile to land on rwy 15 without further incident."
Weather was: Wind 190 degrees at 12 knots, gusting to 17 knots; 3 statute miles visibility; present weather mist; sky condition overcast 300 feet above ground level; altimeter 29.87 inches of mercury.
Remarks rain began at 1416 and rain ended at 1428.
According to the published instrument approach procedure the circling minimum descent altitude was 1,340 feet msl and its weather minima was 1 statute mile visibility.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot not maintaining altitude/clearance from the trees during the circling approach, his continued descent below minimum descent altitude, and the pilot not performing a missed approach.
A factor was the trees the pilot impacted during the circling approach.
Findings Occurrence #1: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH OBJECT Phase of Operation: APPROACH Findings 1.
(F) OBJECT - TREE(S) 2.
(C) ALTITUDE/CLEARANCE - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND 3.
(C) MINIMUM DESCENT ALTITUDE - CONTINUED BELOW - PILOT IN COMMAND 4.
The personal flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 91.
Instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed at the time of the accident.
An Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight plan was on file and was activated.
The pilot and his three passengers reported no injuries.
The flight originated from the Huntsville International Airport-Carl T Jones Field (HSV), near Huntsville, Alabama, about 1210 and landed at UMP, its destination.
The pilot stated: N21992 Received standard flight briefing and filed an IFR flight plan with Anniston, AL FSS [Flight Service Station], on Friday morning, 1-2-04.
UMP was projected to have 700 feet msl [mean sea level] ceilings by our arrival time at 1300 hours CST.
Departed HSV at approximately 1110 hours CST, enroute direct SHB [Shelbyville] VOR, direct UMP.
...
Weather at IND [Indianapolis International Airport] was visibility 1 [statute mile], [overcast] at 300 msl with winds 180 at 12 [knots].
ATC advised N21992 that 2 aircraft had tried to land at UMP earlier that morning, but both had shot missed approaches.
Pilot told Indy approach control that he still wanted to try the approach and permission was granted.
Crossed SHB VOR at 3000 msl, picked up the 330 radial and descended to 2400 msl to begin the approach.
Tracked radial to 15 DME [distance measuring equipment] and began descent at APPIE [intersection].
Descended to 1340 msl and continued to 20 DME but did not clear clouds.
Descended to 1100 msl and broke through at south end of runway.
Remained clear of clouds and entered left, downwind circling approach to rwy [runway] 15 and proceeded with circling north entry.
Clipped uppermost small branches of a tree with left wing in the middle of the turn, pulled aircraft higher for clearance and continued approx 1/4 to 1/2 mile to land on rwy 15 without further incident.
Flight was 2:09 minutes long.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) interviewed a witness.
The FAA's record of interview with that witness stated: The aircraft was at full power as it was [making] more noise than normal aircraft on landing.
The wings were rocking back [and] forth (Top-Gun).
Looked like it was going to hit the chimney of the house across the street.
DAMAGE TO AIRCRAFT The pilot reported that the damage to the airplane was multiple light dents on the left wing, from main gear to wing tip.
He said that a substantial dent was present in the left wing approximately 24 inches inboard from the wing tip.
The frontal area of fiberglass wing tip was damaged and the strobe light/positioning light was broken.
A slight dent was noticed on the left aileron.
Pictures revealed a semicircular dent in the leading edge of the left wing.
The dented area appeared to be crushed rearward about four inches.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION The pilot held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single engine land and instrument airplane operations.
The pilot reported that his last medical examination was conducted on August 14, 2002, and that he was issued a third-class medical certificate with a limitation for corrective lenses.
According to the pilot's report, he had accumulated a total flight time of 1,320 hours and his last flight review was completed on July 9, 2002.
The pilot reported a total of 158 hours in actual IMC and 45 hours as simulated IMC.
The pilot's last recorded instrument proficiency check was completed on July 9, 2002.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION N21992 was a 1978, Piper PA-32RT-300, Lance, serial number 32R-7885265.
The Lance was a low-wing monoplane of all metal construction and was equipped with a constant-speed propeller, wing flaps, and retractable landing gear.
Its engine was a 300 horsepower Lycoming IO-540-K1G5D, serial number L-18528-48A.
The Lance can accommodate a pilot and up to five passengers.
The pilot reported that the airframe and engine had accumulated 2,475 hours total time and that the last annual inspection of the airplane was on September 25, 2003.
The airplane had accumulated 23 hours since that inspection.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION Forecasted weather at the time of the accident was IMC.
An IFR weather briefing and flight plan was filed with Anniston FSS.
The aviation area forecast at 1050 was as follows for Indiana: The northern half of the state was forecast to be overcast at 1,000 feet mean sea level (msl) with cloud tops at 6,000 feet msl.
Visibility is 3-5 statute miles with mist.
Outlook is reported as marginal visual flight rules (MVFR).
The southern half of Indiana was forecast to be overcast at 1,000 feet msl layered up to 25,000 feet msl.
After 1500 it will become overcast at 4,000 feet above ground level (agl), topping out at 6,000 feet agl.
At 1433, the Eagle Creek Airport, near Indianapolis, Indiana, located 13 nautical miles and 241 degrees from UMP, recorded weather was: Wind 190 degrees at 12 knots, gusting to 17 knots; 3 statute miles visibility; present weather mist; sky condition overcast 300 feet agl; altimeter 29.87 inches of mercury.
Remarks: Rain began at 1416 and rain ended at 1428.
AIDS TO NAVIGATION According to the published instrument approach procedure for the VOR runway 33 approach at UMP, the final approach course was 330 degrees, the category A circling minimum descent altitude was 1,340 feet msl, and its weather minima was 1 statute mile visibility.
APPIE intersection is listed as that approach's final approach fix.
The missed approach point is listed as 5.5 nautical miles from the final approach fix.
AIRPORT INFORMATION The East Central US Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD) indicated UMP's field elevation was 811 feet.
