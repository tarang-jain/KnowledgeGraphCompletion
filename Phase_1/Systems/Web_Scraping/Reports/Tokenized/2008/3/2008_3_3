Aviation Incident Final Report
Location: Dallas, TX
Incident Number: DFW08IA074B
Date & Time: 03/01/2008, 1012 CST
Registration: N652SW
Aircraft: BOEING 737-3H4
Aircraft Damage: Minor
Defining Event: Ground collision
Injuries: 137 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 121: Air Carrier - Scheduled
 Analysis The airplane was taxiing to a terminal gate utilizing the taxiway centerline as it passed a stationary airplane that had completed a "pushback" from a terminal gate.
The taxiing airline transport pilot perceived the distance between the two airplanes adequate to continue to the terminal gate, however, the left winglet from the taxiing airplane struck the right horizontal stabilizer of the stationary airplane.
The top portion of the winglet sheared off, and imbedded itself in the horizontal stabilizer of the stationary airplane resulting in minor damage to both airplanes.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be: The failure of the taxiing flight crew to maintain an adequate clearance from the stationary airplane.
There were no injuries to the two airline transport pilots, three flight attendants, and the 102 passengers onboard SWA411, or to the two airline transport pilots, three flight attendants, and the 132 passengers onboard SWA15.
Both airplanes sustained minor damage.
Day instrument meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules (IFR) Flight plan had been filed for SWA411 on the flight from the Birmingham International Airport, Birmingham, Alabama.
An IFR flight plan had been filed for SWA15 with the intended destination of William P. Hobby Airport (HOU), Houston, Texas.
SWA411 had landed on runway 13 left and had a clearance to taxi to gate 2.
While taxiing southbound on taxiway D past SWA15 at gate 11, the left winglet of SWA411 collided with the left horizontal stabilizer of SWA15.
SWA411 immediately stopped in position on taxiway D and shut down both engines.
At the time of the collision SWA15 had completed a pushback from gate 11 and the ground crew had disconnected and left the area.
SWA15 was stationary with the parking brake set waiting for SWA411 to pass before beginning to taxi for takeoff.
The first officer of SWA411 said he asked the captain about wing clearance as they approached SWA15 and the captain looked over his left shoulder and said they had enough room.
After initial photographs were taken SWA411 was towed to gate 2 and the passengers and crew deplaned normally through the jetbridge.
SWA15 was towed to gate 11 and the passengers and crew deplaned normally through the jetbridge.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION SWA411, N741SA, is a Boeing 737-7H4 S/N 29277 manufactured in 1998.
The wingspan is 117 feet 5 inches and the top of the winglet is 21 feet 4 inches high.
The horizontal stabilizer is 47 feet 2 inches wide.
SWA15, N652SW, is a Boeing 737-3H4 S/N 27722 manufactured in 1997.
The wingspan is 102 feet 5 inches and the top of the winglet is 17 feet 9 inches high.
The horizontal stabilizer is 41 feet 8 inches wide and 17 feet high.
FLIGHT RECORDERS Cockpit Voice Recorders Both SWA411 and SWA15 were equipped with a cockpit voice recorders (CVR).
The CVRs were secured and sent to the National Transportation Safety Board's Audio Laboratory for readout.
The recordings consisted of excellent quality audio information.
A CVR group was not formed and a transcript was not prepared.
Flight Data Recorders SWA411 was equipped with a digital flight data recorder (DFDR).
The operator provided a readout of the DFDR data which showed the right engine had been shut down 150 seconds after touchdown and the maximum groundspeed during taxi was 25 knots.
At the time of impact the recorded groundspeed was 7 knots and the airplane was on a magnetic heading of 180 degrees.
The magnetic heading did not change significantly at the time of the event.
There was a perturbation in all three accelerometer values: vertical acceleration of 1.05G, Longitudinal acceleration of -0.42G (with braking), and lateral acceleration of +/- 0.05G, as well as application of significant braking at a recorded time of 10:13:42.
SWA15 was equipped with a digital flight data recorder (DFDR).
The operator provided a readout of the DFDR data which showed the engines were at idle power (N1 ~ 22%), the parking brake was set, and the aircraft was on a magnetic heading of 60 degrees at time of the incident.
There was a perturbation in all three accelerometer values: vertical acceleration of 1.04G, Longitudinal acceleration of -0.05G, and lateral acceleration of -0.18G at a recorded time of 10:12:33.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION SWA411, N741SA, had minor damage to left winglet when a portion of the winglet separated after striking the horizontal stabilizer of SWA15.
SWA15, N652SW, had minor damage to the leading edge of the left horizontal stabilizer where part of the separated left winglet from SWA411 remained imbedded in the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer.
The left horizontal stabilizer of SWA15 had a smear on the underside skin beginning at the location of the separated winglet embedded in the leading edge and continuing to the rear of the left elevator.
That smear measured at an angle of 56 degrees from the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer.
The horizontal stabilizer on SWA15 has a leading edge sweep of approximately 25 degrees.
Caution: Lateral clearance, particularly to the top of the winglet, is difficult to judge.
...
If lateral clearance is in question:  Stop the aircraft, and request a wing walker, request a tug, or wait for the other aircraft to move."
SWA Training Topic 1-07, dated January 31, 2007, reinforces that and adds the caution that from the cockpit the winglet appears to be at the edge of the position light, but is in fact 42 inches further outboard from the apparent position of the wing tip.
This memorandum also directed all pilots to review SWA Training Topic 1-07.
The airport is adding standard yellow markings for the non-movement area on that date.
The DAL 10-7 is scheduled to reflect the new line in the 4 APR 08 revision.
All gates will continue to require a pushback call as stated on DAL page 10-7.
DAL ATC will now control clearance from Gates 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14 to the movement area.
Please remain vigilant; perform the pushback calls and confirm ATC clearance before entering the movement area."
On March 25, 2008, the Dallas air traffic control tower changed their internal procedures so that the ground controller will no longer allow taxi operations on taxiway D at the same time they allow pushback operations from the affected gates.
Southwest Airlines Company framed and prominently mounted the separated top portion of the winglet from SWA411 on the wall of a stairway in their flight training center.
That actual winglet portion is now a graphical and visual reminder to all pilots of this incident.
