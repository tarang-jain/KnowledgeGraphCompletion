 Analysis The private pilot used differential power to help land his twin engine, tailwheel-equipped airplane on a paved runway with a left crosswind.

It crossed over a ditch and struck a metal fence.
The airplane sustained structural damage to the left engine mount.
The left wing tip, left landing gear drag link, right vertical stabilizer and the rudder were also damaged.
