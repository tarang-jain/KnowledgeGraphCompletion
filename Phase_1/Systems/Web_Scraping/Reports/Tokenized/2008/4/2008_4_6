Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: Geneva, OH
Accident Number: CHI08CA103
Date & Time: 04/03/2008, 1640 EDT
Registration: N614TB
Aircraft: Koleno Titan T-51
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The amateur-built airplane was substantially damaged during a forced landing during landing approach.
The pilot reported that as he circled the airport, the engine speed went to 6,000 RPM.
He stated that he pulled the power back, lowered the landing gear and increased the propeller pitch.
He said that the airplane began to stall and he could not maintain altitude.
He executed a forced landing to a wetland.
The right wing struck the water and broke off spinning the airplane around.
Subsequent examination of the controllable pitch propeller revealed that a jack screw pin had sheared allowing the prop to go to a fine pitch setting.
One of the blade pitch stops also broke resulting in the blade moving into a reverse pitch position.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The failure of the propeller pitch control mechanism during approach.
Contributing to the accident were the inability of the pilot to maintain airspeed and altitude, and the unsuitable terrain.
