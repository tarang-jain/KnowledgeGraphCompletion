 Analysis The pilot reported that he was in cruise flight about 700 feet agl over near featureless snow- covered terrain when he encounter lowering ceilings.
He described the weather conditions as rapidly deteriorating.
He began a turn to reverse direction, and the airplane collided with terrain.
His destination, about 10 miles away, was reporting a visibility of 2 miles in mist, and a ceiling of 400 feet broken.
The ceiling was variable between 200 to 900 feet.
A low ceiling and snow-covered terrain likely produced flat lighting conditions, making visual reference to terrain, and determining height above the ground difficult.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's VFR flight into adverse weather conditions that resulted in a collision with snow- covered terrain during a turn to reverse direction.
Factors contributing to the accident were low ceilings, flat lighting conditions, and the snow-covered terrain.
The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country air taxi flight under Title 14, CFR Part 135, when the accident occurred.

The pilot was located by search and rescue personnel about 2040, and transported to Koliganek by snow machine.
In a written statement from the pilot on April 3, he reported that he was in cruise flight about 700 feet agl, and the visibility was good until about 20 miles from Koliganek.
