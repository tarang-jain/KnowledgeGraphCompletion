(F) OBJECT - TREE(S) Factual Information On January 2, 1994, at 1500 mountain standard time (MST), an Aeronca 7BCM, N4244A, collided with a tree just after lift-off from a field near Manila, Utah.
The private pilot, who was the sole occupant of the aircraft, received minor injuries, and the aircraft sustained substantial damage.
The personal pleasure flight, which was departing for Rock Springs, Wyoming, was being operated in visual meteorological conditions at the time of the accident.
The pilot had not filed a flight plan, and the ELT, which was activated by the impact, was turned off at the scene.
According to the pilot, who was taking off from an 800 foot long open field, he was caught by a gust of quartering tailwind just after lift-off.
The aircraft then experienced a decrease in airspeed and a significant decrease in rate of climb.
This was followed by the aircraft impacting a tree situated just beyond the departure end of the field.
