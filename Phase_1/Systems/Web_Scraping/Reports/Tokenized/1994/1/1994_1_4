REPORTEDLY, THE CESSNA PILOTS WERE TRANSMITTING THEIR POSITIONS ON UNICOM, ALSO.
THE BM-4 SUBSEQUENTLY TURNED BASE TO FINAL BEHIND THE CESSNA & WAS SEEN CONVERGING ON THE CESSNA IN DISTANCE & ALTITUDE.
IMPACT OCCURRED ON SHORT FINAL.
WITNESSES SAID THE AIRPLANES REMAINED TOGETHER, ROTATED TO THE LEFT & DESCENDED VERTICALLY TO THE GROUND.
THE BM-4 COLOR WAS WHITE WITH YELLOW TRIM & THE CESSNA WAS COLORED WHITE WITH BROWN TRIM.
YELLOW PAINT TRANSFER WAS OBSERVED ON THE UPPER LEFT WING SURFACE, AFT CABIN SUPPORT POST & AFT WINDSHIELD OF THE CESSNA.
LEADING EDGE DAMAGE OF THE RIGHT WING OF THE BM-4 WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE WIDTH OF THE AFT CABIN WINDOW OF THE CESSNA.
AN IMPACT SIGNATURE MEASUREMENT AT THE OUTBOARD PORTION OF THE LEFT FLAP OF THE CESSNA WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE BM-4 RIGHT LANDING GEAR STRUT WIDTH.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: INADEQUATE VISUAL LOOKOUT BY THE PILOT OF THE HAWK BM-4, WHICH RESULTED IN HIS FAILURE TO SEE-AND-AVOID THE CESSNA 172.
THE BM-4 PILOT'S NON-STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR ENTERING THE TRAFFIC PATTERN WAS A RELATED FACTOR.
Findings Occurrence #1: MIDAIR COLLISION Phase of Operation: APPROACH - VFR PATTERN - FINAL APPROACH Findings 1.
(F) VFR PROCEDURES - NOT FOLLOWED - PILOT IN COMMAND 2.
Both airplanes were on final approach to runway 14R at Clover Field, which is an uncontrolled airport.
Two occupants of the BM-4 and three occupants of the Cessna received fatal injuries.
Visual meteorological conditions with 15 miles visibility prevailed for the local flights.
Interviews with witnesses and associates revealed that the Cessna had departed Ellington Field, Houston, Texas, at 1558.
Its pilot-in-command was a flight instructor conducting a biennial flight review with the private pilot receiving dual instruction.
They performed several VFR patterns for touch and goes on runway 14R.
Pilots in the area recalled the Cessna pilot making the VFR uncontrolled field radio communications over the unicom frequency of 122.8.
The BM-4 departed Clover Field at 1630 and flew westbound for a local personal flight.
Pilots in the area reported a radio transmission on 122.8 from the BM-4 pilot that he was approaching Clover Field from the west for a base entry.
Witnesses observed the Cessna on short final for runway 14R.
Witness reports regarding its altitude varied from 200 feet to 500 feet above the ground.
Witnesses observed the BM-4 turn base to final behind the Cessna.
The BM-4 was initially observed higher above the ground and moving much faster than the Cessna.
Witnesses stated that it appeared the BM-4 was converging on the Cessna in distance and altitude.
The airplanes were described as impacting 1000 feet before the approach end of runway 14R at an altitude of not more than 300 feet.
Witnesses observed the airplanes remain together, rotate to the left and descend vertically to the ground.
DAMAGE TO AIRCRAFT: The BM-4 was found resting on the left wing and cockpit area of the Cessna.
The BM-4 sustained damage to the right wing and right main gear.
The Cessna color was white with brown trim and the BM-4 color was white with yellow trim.
Yellow paint transfers were observed on the upper left wing surface, the aft cabin support post and aft windshield of the Cessna.
Leading edge damage of the right wing of the BM-4 was approximately equal to the width of the aft windshield of the Cessna.
Flap actuator measurements indicated the flaps of the Cessna were extended 30 degrees.
An impact signature measurement at the outboard portion of the left flap of the Cessna was approximately equal to the BM-4 right landing gear strut width.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION: The Office of the Medical Examiner of Harris County in Houston, Texas, performed the autopsies on all cockpit occupants.
TEST AND RESEARCH: Examination of the engines was conducted on January 25, 1994.
The engine examinations did not reveal any discrepancies.
Flight continuity was established.
The integrity of all fuel tanks was compromised.
ADDITIONAL DATA: The airplanes were released to the owner's representatives.
