Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: LINCOLN, NE
Accident Number: CHI95LA051
Date & Time: 12/03/1994, 1330 CST
Registration: N234PC
Aircraft: P. D. CHAMBERS SWIFT PC-1V8
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 2 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis THE EXPERIMENTAL AIRPLANE WAS PERFORMING TOUCH AND GO LANDINGS.
THE ENGINE WAS A 330 HORSEPOWER BUICK V-8, APPROVED FOR THE USE OF AUTOMOTIVE GASOLINE FUEL.
THE LOCATION OR TIME OF THE LAST REFUELING IS UNKNOWN.
SEVERAL WITNESSES DESCRIBED A CESSATION OF ENGINE NOISE, AND THE AIRPLANE DESCENDING VERTICALLY IN A SPIN.
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ROTATION ON THE PROPELLER AT IMPACT, AND WATER WAS FOUND IN THE CARBURETOR.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane, resulting in a stall-spin.
Factors were an inadequate preflight and the loss of engine power resulting from water contamination in the automotive fuel.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF ENGINE POWER(PARTIAL) - NONMECHANICAL Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - INITIAL CLIMB Findings 1.
(F) FLUID,FUEL - CONTAMINATION 2.
(F) AIRCRAFT PREFLIGHT - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND 3.
(F) FLUID - WATER ---------- Occurrence #2: FORCED LANDING Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY DESCENT/LANDING ---------- Occurrence #3: LOSS OF CONTROL - IN FLIGHT Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY DESCENT/LANDING Findings 4.
(C) STALL/SPIN - ENCOUNTERED - PILOT IN COMMAND ---------- Occurrence #4: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: DESCENT - UNCONTROLLED Findings 5.
The private pilot and private pilot passenger both sustained fatal injuries.
Visual meteorological conditions existed at the time of the accident and no flight plan was filed.
The flight operated under 14 CFR Part 91 as a personal flight, had originated from the Chambers Airstrip approximately 1323 CST and was performing touch and go landings.
The pilot did not possess a current medical certificate, nor a current biennial flight review.
Several witnesses described the airplane in the touch and go pattern, a cessation of engine noise, and falling straight down to the ground.
Witnesses described no indications that the airplane had skidded or moved upon hitting the ground.
The landing gear were imbedded vertically downward into the soft ground, with no indications of forward motion, according to witness statements.
The propeller blades and spinner did not exhibit any rotational damage.
Witnesses described the airplane in the landing pattern, at approximately 500 feet, and possibly on a base leg for landing.
Descriptions were of the "engine sputtering" and "going silent."
Witnesses also described the wings "wobbling," and a vertical, nose low, rotating descent, consistent with descriptions of a spin.
The airplane was registered as an experimental, homebuilt airplane.
It was rebuilt from a destroyed 1946 Globe Swift model GC-1B, serial number 1068.
The pilot was also the mechanic who rebuilt the airplane as a Patrick Chambers, PC-1V8, serial number 001.
The engine was a Buick V-8 automotive engine, and was using automotive gasoline as fuel.
No information was available about where or when the airplane was last refueled.
The airplane was granted an experimental airworthiness certificate by the Federal Aviation Administration on October 25, 1988.
The FAA airworthiness inspector on scene stated that water was present in the carburetor and carburetor accelerator pump.
Toxicological specimens were tested by the Federal Aviation Administration Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI).
All tests were negative except 10.000 mg/dl ethanol was detected in the vitreous fluid of the pilot.
No ethanol was detected in his blood or urine.
CAMI stated on March 21, 1995 that the vitreous fluid retains ethanol longer than the other two fluids, that the indication could be post-mortem formation, and that no impairment would be indicated by these results.
An autopsy was performed by the Lancaster County Coroner Office, Lincoln, Nebraska, on December 5, 1994.
Manner of death cited in the reports on both occupants was trauma, sustained in an aircraft accident.
