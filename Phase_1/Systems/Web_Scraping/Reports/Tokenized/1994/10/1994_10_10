The airplane, flown by a commercial pilot, was on a personal flight from Dodge City, Kansas.
No flight plan was filed and dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The pilot and one passenger were uninjured.
According to a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, the pilot made two previous attempts to land on the unlighted grass strip and executed two go-arounds.
He further reported that on the third attempt to land he allowed the aircraft to "settle lower and slower than planned."
The passenger stated "get it up" and the pilot applied "full power to climb."
The pilot reported that immediately following the addition of power he "heard and felt a crunch."
The pilot reduced power following the crunching sound and the aircraft struck the ground.
After the pilot and his passenger exited the aircraft they discovered that the aircraft had struck a fence causing damage to the firewall and landing gear.
