 Analysis SHORTLY AFTER LIFTING OFF, THE PILOT LIGHT ON THE BALLOON'S PROPANE BURNER EXTINGUISHED FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS, AND ATTEMPTS TO RELIGHT IT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.
BECAUSE THE BALLOON WAS DESCENDING NEAR POWERLINES, THE PILOT 'VENTED' IN ORDER TO RAPIDLY LOSE ALTITUDE.
THE BALLOON TOUCHED DOWN ON A HIGHWAY, BOUNCED BACK UP, AND THE ENVELOPE CONTACTED POWERLINES, BURNING SEVERAL ENVELOPE PANELS.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: A TOTAL FAILURE OF THE BALLOON'S HEATER SYSTEM (PILOT LIGHT) FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS.
A FACTOR WAS UNSUITABLE TERRAIN ON WHICH TO MAKE A FORCED LANDING.

OBJECT - WIRE,TRANSMISSION Factual Information On July 1, 1994, approximately 0730 mountain daylight time, N748CB, a Cameron Balloons V- 77, was substantially damaged when it collided with powerlines in Littleton, Colorado.
The private pilot was not injured.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The following is based on the pilot/operator report.
Shortly after lifting off, the pilot light on the propane burner extinguished for undetermined reasons, and attempts to relight it were unsuccessful.
Because the balloon was descending near powerlines, the pilot "vented" in order to rapidly lose altitude.
The balloon touched down on a highway, bounced back up, and the envelope contacted powerlines about 20 feet above the basket.
Several envelope panels were damaged by electrical arcing and there was a small grass fire.
