The airplane, flown by a commercial pilot, was on an local aerial application flight.
There was no flight plan filed and visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The pilot was not injured.
According to the pilot, he had departed a private strip about 5 miles from the field he was spraying 10 minutes before the accident.
He stated that, as he was making his turn after the second pass at 200 feet AGL, the engine lost power without warning.
He was not sure if it was a complete power loss or if the engine was still developing idle power.
The pilot subsequently attempted to land between two tree lines; however, he said that the airplane stalled prior to touchdown and one wing dug into the ground and the airplane cart wheeled.
The reason for the engine failure was not determined during the field examination and it was not subsequently reported by the operator.
