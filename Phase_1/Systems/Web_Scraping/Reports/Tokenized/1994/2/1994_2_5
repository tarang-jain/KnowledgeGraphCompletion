TERRAIN CONDITION - OPEN FIELD Factual Information On February 3, 1994, approximately 1721 central standard time, a Cessna T210H, N6914R, was destroyed during a forced landing about 8 miles northwest of the McAllen, Texas, Airport.
The pilot received minor injuries.
Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and an IFR flight plan had been filed.
The following is based on the pilot/operator report.
The pilot missed two instrument approaches to the Corpus Christi, Texas, Airport, so he diverted to McAllen, Texas, his alternate.
Shortly after intercepting the localizer course at McAllen, the engine lost power.
The pilot said both fuel gauges indicated 1/4 fuel in each tank.
He declared an emergency and, after emerging from the overcast, elected to land wheels up in an open field about 8 miles northwest of the airport.
He inadvertently stalled the airplane 25 feet above the ground.
The pilot said he had flown 4.0 hours and the airplane had an endurance of 5.5 hours.
Salvage personnel and a Federal Aviation Administration inspector who went to the site reported the fuel tanks had not been compromised, and there was no fuel in the tanks.
In addition, when the wings were demated from the fuselage, no fuel came out of the fuel lines.
