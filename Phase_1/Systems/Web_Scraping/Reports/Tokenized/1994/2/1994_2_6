OBJECT - UTILITY POLE Factual Information On February 3, 1994, at 1530 central standard time, a Cessna 175, N7141M, struck a power pole and collided with terrain during a forced landing near the Paris, Arkansas, Municipal Airport.
The pilot received serious injuries and the aircraft sustained substantial damage.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the ferry flight.
According to information provided by witnesses, the aircraft was being ferried to Ozark, Arkansas, for repairs.
The airplane took off and the engine lost all power after takeoff at an altitude estimated to be between 200 and 300 feet above ground level (AGL).
The pilot said he attempted to return to the airport but stalled the aircraft and struck a utility pole during the emergency descent.
According to information supplied by the FAA inspector who went on scene, the aircraft had its last annual inspection in 1981, and had been sitting at the airport without use for approximately a year and a half.
He also provided information that the aircraft had flown about 30 hours in the last 13 years.
The FAA inspector stated that an annual inspection had been started on November 16, 1990, and that during that inspection, 36 safety of flight discrepancies had been found.
The annual was not completed and the pilot, who is not a licensed mechanic, said he repaired the necessary things and "it checked out good on the ground."
The FAA inspector did not sample the fuel or conduct an internal examination of the engine; however, the attached photographs provide evidence of rust and algae growth in the fuel tanks.
