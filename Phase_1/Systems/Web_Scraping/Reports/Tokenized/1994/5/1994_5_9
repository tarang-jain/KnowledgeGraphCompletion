 Analysis The pilot completed the preflight inspection of the aircraft and loaded his passengers on board.
The aircraft had been idle for about a month.
On the first start attempt, the engine turned over very slowly and the pilot discontinued the start cycle.
The pilot got out of the aircraft to pull the propeller through several revolutions and, as he did so, the engine suddenly started and went to a high power setting.
The pilot said he tried to get back into the cockpit, but he had trouble with the door latch.
The pilot next attempted to restrain the aircraft by holding the tail, but he was knocked to the ground in the effort.
The aircraft ran into a hangar, bending a wing spar.
The pilot said that on reflection he believes that he forgot to turn off the magnetos completely before trying to turn the propeller through the revolutions.
