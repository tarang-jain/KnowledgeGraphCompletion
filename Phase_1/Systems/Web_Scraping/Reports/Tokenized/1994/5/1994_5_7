PROMETHAZINE IS PROHIBITED FOR USE BY PILOTS WHILE FLYING.
THE PILOT HAD A COLD AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: THE PILOT'S SELECTION OF A FLIGHT ROUTE AND EN ROUTE DESCENT ALTITUDE INSUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE TERRAIN CLEARANCE.
FACTORS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: THE DARK NIGHT LIGHT CONDITION AND THE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN.

USE OF INAPPROPRIATE MEDICATION/DRUG - PILOT IN COMMAND Factual Information HISTORY OF FLIGHT On May 1, 1994, about 2119 hours Pacific daylight time, a Piper PA-28R-201T, N47628, was destroyed during a collision sequence with mountainous terrain near La Verne, California.
The private pilot was fatally injured.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal night cross-country flight and no flight plan was filed.
The flight originated about 2100 hours at Cable Airport, Claremont, California, and was destined for Whiteman Airport, Pacoima, California.
At 1804 on the evening of the accident, the pilot contacted the  Riverside Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) and requested specific preflight weather information (abbreviated briefing), prior to departure.
At the time of the briefing, the Riverside Flight Service Station had on file a NOTAM (notice to airmen) for the closure of the Whiteman Airport.
The closure was for weekdays from 2000 hours to 0600 hours effective April 29, 1994.  Review of a transcript of the briefing revealed that the NOTAM information was not given to the pilot.
The pilot was assigned a transponder code of 5536.
The pilot was then advised that the Whiteman Airport was closed for maintenance.
The pilot questioned the duration of the closure, and the controller stated, "all night."
The pilot acknowledged.
The controller asked the pilot his intentions, and he said, "I'm thinking, just a minute."
He then questioned the controller regarding the weather outlook.
Shortly thereafter, he stated that he would return to his home base at Cable.
About 2111, Burbank Approach Control terminated their services and requested that the pilot change his transponder code to 1200, and they approved a frequency change.
The aircraft was observed by Burbank recorded radar data to reverse course eastbound and proceed out of the Burbank radar service area.
Review of the radar data revealed that after the course reversal, the aircraft began a climb from 6,500 to 7,000 feet, then began a descent which continued to impact in the foothills immediately north of the greater Los Angeles Basin.
The last recorded Mode C altitude information recorded for the aircraft was 3,400 feet.
The accident site is at 2,600 feet.
On the evening of the accident, a family member reported the  airplane overdue about 2308.
Recorded radar data was obtained from the Burbank and Ontario Approach Control facilities.
According to the data, the airplane was tracked back into the Ontario radar service area.
About 2118:22, the aircraft was lost from radar contact in the vicinity of the accident site.
PILOT INFORMATION The personal pilot flight time records were not recovered.
According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) medical records, the pilot reported a total flight time of 2,200 hours, with 55 hours in the last 6 months, at his last third-class flight physical dated August 17, 1993.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION According to logbook records, the last documented annual inspection was accomplished on June 22, 1993, at a recording tachometer time of 818.5 hours.
At that inspection, the total flight time for the airplane was annotated to be 1,978.93 hours.
According to the engine logbook, the engine time since major overhaul was 182.29 hours.
At the accident site, the recording tachometer indicated 933.87 hours.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION The accident site was located in the Angeles National Forest on Johnstone Peak, about 2,600 feet mean sea level (msl).
The wreckage path was measured to be on an approximate 075 degree magnetic bearing.
The wreckage path was through a ravine, densely covered by trees, on a descending path of about 10 degrees to the horizontal.
Both wings, horizontal stabilizers, vertical stabilizer, and rudder had been severed from the airframe and were strewn the length of the wreckage path, which was measured to be about 150 feet in length.
Examination of the No.
1 navigation/communication radio revealed that the communication frequency was on 123.0 MHz, and the navigation frequency was on 110.4 MHz.
Examination of the recording tachometer revealed an indicator needle imprint at 2,225 rpm.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION On May 5, 1994, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner performed an autopsy on the pilot.
Specimens were obtained from the pilot during the autopsy for toxicological analysis by the FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
The results of the toxicological analysis conducted on the specimens were negative for carbon monoxide and cyanide.
The analysis was positive for the following drugs in the amounts listed: 1) pseudoephedrine, 0.64 mg/L in blood, 0.15 mg/L in liver tissue; 2) promethazine, 3.4 mg/kg in liver tissue; and 3) brompheniramine, 3.0 mg/kg in liver tissue.
According to the CAMI toxicologists, the quantities of pseudoephedrine found in the blood sample were at therapeutic levels.
According to the FAA Western Pacific Regional Flight Surgeon's office, pseudoephedrine and brompheniramine are approved for use by pilots while flying, assuming there are no adverse side effects.
Promethazine is prohibited for use and is medically disqualifying.
According to the pilot's wife, he had a cold at the time of the accident.
Prescription and nonprescription drug containers were found during the on-scene examination of the wreckage.
A prescription container for pseudoephedrine with an expiration date of 12/92 was found along with an over-the-counter nasal decongestant spray bottle.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION According to the FAA Air Traffic Control Handbook 7110.10K, Conduct of Abbreviated Briefing, paragraph 3-11.
(a): "When a pilot requests specific information only, provide the requested information.
If adverse conditions are present or forecast, advise the pilot of this fact."
On January 9, 1995, the wreckage was released to the insurance company representative of the pilot.
