 Analysis THE PILOT WAS IN A HOVER AT 125 FEET AGL AND ZERO HORIZONTAL VELOCITY WHEN THE ENGINE QUIT.
HE HAD BEEN CONDUCTING LOGGING OPERATIONS FOR APPROXIMATELY 40 MINUTES ON A 200 POUND FUEL LOAD.
HE EXECUTED AN AUTOROTATION BUT LANDED HARD WITH THE HELICOPTER ROLLING OVER.
THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE RAN OUT OF FUEL WHILE IN THE HOVER.
AUTOROTATION FROM 125 FEET AT ZERO AIRSPEED WAS OUTSIDE THE PARAMETERS OF THE AIRCRAFT'S 'HEIGHT - VELOCITY' DIAGRAM.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: FUEL EXHAUSTION, THE PILOT IN COMMAND'S FAILURE TO REFUEL THE AIRCRAFT, AND THE INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE AN AUTO- ROTATION LANDING BECAUSE OF THE LOW ALTITUDE.

The pilot reported that while in a hover, approximately 125 feet above ground, he experienced a loss of power.
He executed an autorotation and a hard landing followed during which the helicopter rolled over.
The pilot reported to the operator that he had run out of gas.
A representative of the manufacturer stated that autorotations conducted from a zero airspeed hover of 125 feet above ground were within the "dead man's curve" area of the aircraft's "Height - Velocity" diagram.
