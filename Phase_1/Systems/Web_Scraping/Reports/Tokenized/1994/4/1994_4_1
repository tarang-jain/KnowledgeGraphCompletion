OBJECT - AIRPORT FACILITY Factual Information On April 1, 1994, at 1253 central standard time, a Piper PA-36- 300, N3735E, registered to Carlson Aerial, Inc., collided with the terrain during the initial takeoff climb from runway 17 at the Beloit Municipal Airport, Beloit, Kansas, while on a personal flight.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed.
The pilot was seriously injured and the airplane was substantially damaged.
The flight was originating at the time of the accident.
The pilot reported that at an altitude of 150 feet a loss of engine power was experienced.
He continued to report, "The loss of power resulted in a stalled condition with insufficient altitude to recover."
The airplane descended into the roof of a hangar.
One witness who saw the airplane takeoff stated it made a 60 degree bank, climbing right turn after takeoff to an altitude of about 300 feet.
According to this witness the airplane appeared to stall.
This witness stated, "Sounded like climb power at all times."
Another witness who recounted a similar accident scenario stated, "Sounded like full power on engine."
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector who traveled to the accident site reported slash marks were present in the hangar.
The aircraft wreckage was moved to Lubbock, Texas, and a teardown was performed which was overseen by an inspector from the Lubbock, Texas, Flight Standards District Office of the FAA.
This inspector reported there was no indication of any internal failure of the engine.
The fuel control unit was removed and sent to Allied Signal in Canada for testing.
The fuel pump was forwarded to Pratt & Whitney in Canada for testing.
The fuel control unit was bench tested and was found to perform "within the acceptable test limits."
The fuel pump could not be bench tested due to impact damage.
A teardown of the pump disclosed, "The pump element itself was found to be in a satisfactory condition."
The teardown of the fuel pump and the bench testing to the fuel control unit were overseen by an inspector from Transport Canada.
