HE STATED THAT THE AIRPLANE THEN ENCOUNTERED WIND SHEAR.
HE LOST CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE AND IT DRIFTED INTO A TREE LOCATED ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE RUNWAY.
THE PILOT DID NOT REPORT ANY MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS AND STATED THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE INITIATED THE FLIGHT BECAUSE OF THE HIGH WINDS.

(F) WEATHER CONDITION - GUSTS 2.
(C) AIRSPEED - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND ---------- Occurrence #2: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH OBJECT Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - INITIAL CLIMB Findings 3.
OBJECT - TREE(S) Factual Information On April 2, 1994, about 1830 hours eastern standard time, N5868B, a Cessna 182, operated by the Thunderbird Sport Parachute Club, Inc., Versailles, Kentucky, impacted a tree during takeoff in Berea, Kentucky.

According to a Federal Aviation Administration aviation safety inspector,  the owner of the airplane was seated in the right front seat during the accident.
He told the FAA safety inspector that the engine was producing full power and that the airplane did not have enough airspeed to take off.
