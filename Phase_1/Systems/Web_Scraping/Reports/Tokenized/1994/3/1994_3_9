ABORT ABOVE V1 - PERFORMED - FLIGHTCREW Factual Information On March 2, 1994, at 1758 eastern standard time, a McDonnell Douglas  MD-80, N18835, operated by Continental Airlines as flight 795,  sustained substantial damage during an aborted takeoff at  La Guardia Airport in Flushing, New York (LGA).
Of the 116 persons  on board the airplane, two were flight crewmembers, four were cabin  crewmembers, and 110 were passengers.
There were seven minor injuries  during the accident sequence and evacuation.
A special weather observation, made about 5 minutes after the accident,  found the weather as drifting snow conditions, with an indefinite  ceiling at 500 feet, obscured, with the wind out of 050 at 23 knots.
The flight was to have been from LGA to Denver Stapleton International  Airport, Colorado (DEN).
During the attempted takeoff on runway 13,  the first officer was at the controls.
The captain, seeing that the  airspeed indication was not increasing normally, but remained low, elected to abort by pulling back on the throttles, entering reverse  thrust , and taking control of the airplane.
The airplane came to  rest pitched downward, so that the nose of the airplane rested on a  mud flat of the Flushing Bay Tidal, which at the time of the accident,  was above the waterline.
