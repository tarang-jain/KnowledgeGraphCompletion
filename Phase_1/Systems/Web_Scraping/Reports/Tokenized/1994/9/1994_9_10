Date & Time: 09/01/1994, 1435 EDT
Registration: N445B
Aircraft: BEECH F33A
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 Minor, 3 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis THE PILOT STATED THAT DURING A LANDING: 'AIRCRAFT FLARED...AND ROSE DUE TO GROUND EFFECT.'
THE AIRPLANE FLOATED DOWN THE RUNWAY, AND THE TOUCHDOWN OCCURRED FAR DOWN THE RUNWAY.
THE AIRPLANE EXITED THE END OF THE RUNWAY, AND THE PILOT APPLIED RIGHT BRAKE TO AVOID IMPACTING A FENCE.
THE NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED, AND THE AIRPLANE IMPACTED THE ROUGH TERRAIN.
THE FAA INSPECTOR STATED IN HIS REPORT: '...THE AIRCRAFT TOUCHED DOWN AT HIGH SPEED ON THE LAST 268 FEET OF USABLE RUNWAY.
AFTER CONTINUING OFF THE RUNWAY AT HIGH SPEED, THE PILOT PLACED THE AIRCRAFT INTO A HARD RIGHT TURN.'
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot maintaining excessive airspeed during the landing, resulting in a touchdown on the runway with insufficient distance to stop, and a subsequent intentional ground loop and collision with the terrain.
Also causal was the pilot's failure to abort the landing.
Findings Occurrence #1: OVERRUN Phase of Operation: LANDING - ROLL Findings 1.
(C) AIRSPEED - EXCESSIVE - PILOT IN COMMAND 2.
(C) PROPER TOUCHDOWN POINT - NOT ATTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND 3.
(C) ABORTED LANDING - NOT PERFORMED - PILOT IN COMMAND ---------- Occurrence #2: NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED Phase of Operation: LANDING - ROLL Findings 4.
LANDING GEAR,NOSE GEAR - OVERLOAD 5.
The pilot and two of the  passengers were not injured.
One passenger received minor injuries.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed.
The flight was being conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
In his report, the pilot stated: Speed was slowly reduced to 80 MPH on final.
....Aircraft flared at the "numbers" and rose           due to ground effect...eased back as the           aircraft began downward descent.
Back           pressure applied again and the same           occurrence repeated.
Aircraft skidded off the runway onto grass           overrun.
Right rudder and brake was applied           making aircraft turn to right and slide to           stop.
The FAA Operations Inspector stated in his report: While approaching runway 28...the aircraft touched           down at high speed on the last 268 feet of usable           runway.
After continuing off the runway at speed,           the pilot placed the aircraft into a hard right           turn effectively "ground looping" to a stop.
The reported wind at the airport was 290 degrees at 9 knots.
