OBJECT - FENCE POST Factual Information On September 1, 1994, at 1030 eastern daylight time, a Piper PA-28R-180, owned and piloted by Alfred Barr, was substantially damaged during landing at the Vine Grove Airport, Vine Grove, Kentucky.
The pilot was not injured.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan had not been filed for the flight operating under 14 CFR 91.
In the NTSB Form 6120.1/2, the pilot stated that he was using left control and correction on final, to compensate for a quartering left head wind, while landing on runway 11.
He further stated: "...At ground level the wind quit.
I touched down heading slightly left of the runway center.
I tried to steer right with rudder with no response, probably because the grass runway was wet with dew.
The airplane travelled approximately thirty yards when it struck a wooden post with the left wing.
The airplane continued in a sharp left turn causing the left and right main landing gear to collapse.
Winds at an airport, 6 miles north of Vine Grove, were reported to be from 060 degrees an 8 knots.
