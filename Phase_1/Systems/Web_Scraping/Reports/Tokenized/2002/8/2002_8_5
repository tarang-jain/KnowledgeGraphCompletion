 Analysis The amateur built airplane collided with trees during the climb phase of an aborted landing.
The pilot reported that while on short final the airplane seemed to be traveling faster than normal although the airspeed indicator was indicating a normal approach speed of about 45 mph.
He stated the airplane floated during the landing.
He reported that he applied the brakes when the main gear touched down, but the airplane still seemed to be going too fast.
He stated that he decided to go around when he reached a point approximately two-thirds the way down the 650 foot long landing area.
The pilot reported he added full power, but was unable to gain sufficient altitude to clear trees at the end of the landing area.
The airplane contacted the trees at an estimated altitude of about 20 feet.
The pilot reported the landing area was a combination of a gravel driveway and grass area.
He stated the normal landing distance for the airplane is about 250 feet.
The normal takeoff distance with two adults and at gross weight is about 160 feet.
