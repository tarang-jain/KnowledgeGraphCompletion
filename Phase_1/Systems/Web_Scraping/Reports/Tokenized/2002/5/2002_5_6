 Analysis The student pilot had just landed, and made a left turn onto the "teardrop" taxiway.
The right brake failed, and the airplane departed the taxiway, went into a ditch, and nosed over.
Post- accident examination revealed that the right brake cylinder was out of fluid, and other than a small amount of fluid up on the cylinder shaft, there were no holes or leaks noted.
The brake system had been last checked about 4 1/2 months earlier, during the airplane's latest annual inspection.
