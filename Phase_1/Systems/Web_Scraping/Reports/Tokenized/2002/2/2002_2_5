Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: Rio Vista, CA
Accident Number: LAX02LA078
Date & Time: 02/02/2002, 1300 PST
Registration: N2221X
Aircraft: Robinette Ultra Pup
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 2 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The experimental, amateur-built airplane landed off-airport following a total loss of engine power on climbout.
The pilot reported that during the initial climb after a slow-flight, low pass down the 4,200-foot-long runway and while about 200 feet above ground level, the engine lost all power although the propeller continued to windmill.
After the accident, there was about 9 gallons of 100-octane aviation fuel aboard.
Earlier the same day he had flown a prior flight leg on the same tank of fuel.
The pilot suspected that carburetor icing was the cause of the engine loss of power.
The airplane was equipped with a Mosler converted automotive engine, and was equipped with carburetor heat.
The carburetor heat control was in the "on" position when engine power was lost.
A generic carburetor icing probability chart used by the Safety Board showed the ambient temperature and dew point conditions to have been within the region marked "serious icing - cruise or climb power."
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.
