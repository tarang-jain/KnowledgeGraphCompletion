 Analysis According to the pilot, the aircraft lost oil pressure shortly after takeoff.
During the landing attempt at a nearby airport, the aircraft overran the end of the runway and collided with a tree.
A post-accident engine run and wreckage examination revealed that the aircraft's engine developed an extensive engine oil leak during the accident flight, and during a post-accident engine run.
According to the FAA Inspector, and the operator of the aircraft, the leak originated from the engine accessory area where the oil temperature bulb attaches to the oil screen assembly.
