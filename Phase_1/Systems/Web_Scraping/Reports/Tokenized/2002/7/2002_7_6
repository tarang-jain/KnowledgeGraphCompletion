 Analysis The pilot reported that during landing roll, the tailwheel-equipped airplane abruptly veered to the left and departed the runway.
The pilot regained directional control after the airplane had swerved about 60 degrees from the runway.
In the process of returning to the runway, the right main landing gear struck an earthen berm about 16 inches high, and the airplane nosed over.
Examination of the airplane revealed that the tail wheel side spring, between the rudder horn and tailwheel, on the right side of the tail wheel assembly, was disconnected, and the clip which held the spring in place was missing.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The loss of a clip and subsequent loss of the spring on the right side of the tail wheel assembly, for undetermined reasons, which led to a loss of directional control.
A factor was the berm.

The certificated private pilot was not injured.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight, which originated at Culpeper Regional Airport (CJR), Culpeper, Virginia.
No flight plan had been filed for the flight that was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
The pilot stated: "...Approach to Smith Mountain Lake was normal.

In a follow-up telephone interview, the pilot described the left turn as abrupt, with no indication of a problem prior to the turn.
According to an inspector from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), examination of the airplane revealed that the clip which held the tail wheel spring to the tail wheel on the right side of the tail wheel assembly, was missing, and the spring was disconnected.
A search of the runway failed to find the clip.
