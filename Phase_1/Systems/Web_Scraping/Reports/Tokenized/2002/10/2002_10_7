The instructional flight experienced a total loss of engine power during the eighth takeoff in a series of touch and go landings.
The airplane was climbing through 200 feet above ground level when the engine quit and a left 90-degree turn was executed so as to land in a grassy area.
An engine restart was not attempted.
Examination of the wreckage confirmed flight control continuity, electrical continuity of the ignition system, engine continuity, and engine compression.
Fuel was found in both engine carburetors, oil was found within the engine, and coolant was present in the coolant tank.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The low altitude at which an undetermined loss of engine power occurred following takeoff.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF ENGINE POWER Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - INITIAL CLIMB Findings 1.
(C) REASON FOR OCCURRENCE UNDETERMINED ---------- Occurrence #2: FORCED LANDING Phase of Operation: DESCENT - EMERGENCY ---------- Occurrence #3: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY LANDING Findings 2.
