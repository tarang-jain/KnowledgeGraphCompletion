Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: Laramie, WY
Accident Number: DEN03FA002
Date & Time: 10/01/2002, 1627 MDT
Registration: N210HC
Aircraft: Cessna T210M
Aircraft Damage: Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Business
 Analysis The instrument rated pilot was on an IFR cross-country flight.
During the course of the flight, he requested a "turn back on course and if you could work out a lower altitude, we'd appreciate it."
He was soon cleared to "descend and maintain one seven thousand (feet)."
The pilot later asked the controller if he could "work us out of one seven thousand (feet), down to one three thousand (feet) or one one thousand (feet)."
The controller cleared the pilot to descend to 13,000 feet.
The pilot acknowledged the clearance and remarked, "see if we can work our way through these clouds."
Later, the pilot reported, "Got a pretty big opening.
I'm gonna cancel out on this IFR.
I think I can make a big circle and get under this scattered layer, if that's okay with you."
The controller approved the pilot's request to cancel his IFR flight plan.
The airplane was in a circling descent before radar contact was lost.
The wreckage was located about 45 miles from the last radar contact.
According to the pilot's logbook, he had accrued 37.3 and 82.0 hours in actual and simulated instrument meteorological conditions, respectively.
According to the pilot's son, his father would file an IFR flight plan and fly in the IFR "system" to stay current with IFR procedures and controller phraseology but, as a rule, he avoided flying in actual instrument meteorological conditions.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the pilot's improper inflight planning/decision, and his failure to maintain terrain clearance while attempting a low altitude maneuver.
Contributing factors were the mountainous terrain, the airplane™s low altitude, and the pilot's lack of total instrument time.
Findings Occurrence #1: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: MANEUVERING Findings 1.
(C) IN-FLIGHT PLANNING/DECISION - IMPROPER - PILOT IN COMMAND 2.
(C) CLEARANCE - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND 3.
(F) TERRAIN CONDITION - MOUNTAINOUS/HILLY 4.
(C) LOW ALTITUDE FLIGHT/MANEUVER - ATTEMPTED 5.
(F) ALTITUDE - LOW 6.
The instrument rated private pilot, the sole occupant aboard, was fatally injured.
Although visual meteorological conditions were reported in Laramie, evidence indicates instrument meteorological conditions existed at the accident site.
An IFR flight plan had been filed for the business flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91.
The flight originated at Twin Bridges, Montana, at 1335.
According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documents, the pilot contacted the Great Falls, Montana, Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) on his cellular telephone at 1115, and obtained a preflight weather briefing "to Denver Centennial or–in the Denver area somewhere down there."
The pilot said he could go IFR but preferred VFR, because "[I] don't like it over the mountains that much."
His preferred route was from "Sheridan straight to Laramie then down to Front Range.
After some initial confusion as to where he was departing (Sheridan, Montana, not Sheridan, Wyoming), the pilot was advised of an AIRMET (airman meteorology) for "mountain obscurement and potential for icing."
The controller said, "I would certainly expect mountain obscurement.
To go VFR underneath, you'd have to be fairly low, so it would be a little bit of a scud running situation.
Can't recommend VFR into the mountains."
The pilot replied, "It doesn't really sound like too good a trip to me," and the controller said, "No.
At best, it'd be scud running.
At worst, it would be IFR."
Towards the end of the briefing, the controller added, "[You're looking at] mainly mountain obscurement and some spotty IFR through western and southwestern Wyoming.
So, again, out over the plains, say, to Billings, and cut down the east sides of the Big Horns, you'll be in pretty good shape.
If you stay VFR, in you want to stay VFR, you'll have to be fairly low altitude, but looks like there's enough room."
The briefing terminated at 1127.
According to the pilot's wife, her husband departed Twin Bridges airstrip, near Dillon, and was en route to Erie, Colorado, on business.
At 1412, the pilot contacted the Salt Lake Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), reported his position as being 22 miles southwest of Livingston, Montana, and requested an IFR clearance to Erie.
The controller asked the pilot if he had a current flight plan on file, and what were his flight conditions.
The pilot replied that he was not operating under a current flight plan, that he was not yet clear of clouds and had not encountered icing, and was receiving navigational signals from the Billing VOR.
The controller told the pilot to contact Great Falls AFSS and file a flight plan, then report back to him.
At 1419, he contacted Great Falls AFSS, advised that he was in contact with the Salt Lake ARTCC, that he had been flying VFR "but had to cancel out," and wanted to air file an IFR flight plan.
The pilot said he had departed Twin Bridges, Montana, at 1335, and his route of flight "from approximately Livingston" would be "direct Billings, direct Laramie, direct 48V (Erie, Colorado)."
He said he had 4 hours, 15 minutes of fuel on board, and his estimated time en route was "another two hours."
At 1423, the pilot reestablished contact with Salt Lake ARTCC.
At 1527, the flight was handed off to the Denver ARTCC.
Recorded NTAP (National Track Analysis Program) radar data was retrieved by the Denver ARTCC and plotted.
Data began at 1609:44 and terminated at 1625:52.
In addition, FAA provided a transcript of voice communications, beginning at 1527:46 and terminating at 1620:43.
According to this data, at 1527, the pilot contacted Denver ARTCC and reported to be level at FL190 (19,000 feet).
He was given a heading change "for traffic" at 1550:45.
At 1553:30 and again at 1554:44, the pilot requested a "turn back on course and if you could work out a lower altitude, we'd appreciate it."
At 1555:23, the pilot was "cleared direct Laramie," and at 1555:58, he was cleared to "descend and maintain one seven thousand (feet)."
He was also given the Casper, Wyoming, altimeter setting of 30.09.
At 1611:20, the pilot of N210HC asked the controller if he could "work us out of one seven thousand (feet), down to one three thousand (feet) or one one thousand (feet)."
The controller cleared the pilot to descend to 13,000 feet.
The pilot acknowledged the clearance and remarked, "see if we can work our way through these clouds."
Radar data showed the airplane already at 16,800 feet, and it began its descent at 1612:08.
At 1619:22, the pilot attempted to contact the controller but radio communications were unreadable, and the controller told the pilot to contact him on frequency 132.1 MHz.
When the pilot did so, he said, "Yes, sir, I'm presently about thirty nine miles to the northwest of Laramie.
Got a pretty big opening there.
I ought to cancel out on this IFR.
I think I can make a big circle and get under this scattered layer, if that's okay with you."
At that point, radar data showed the airplane at 12,900 feet and descending.
The controller approved the pilot's request to cancel his IFR flight plan and the pilot said, "We're showing thirty eight point eight (miles) to the northwest of Laramie."
The controller confirmed the location.
This was the last known radio transmission with the pilot.
According to the NTAP data, the transponder code was switched from 6042 to 1200 (VFR) at 1620:45 when the airplane was at 12,900 feet.
Between 1620:26 and 1621:33, the airplane started a right turn and descended to 12,600 feet.
Between 1621:33 and 1622:40, the airplane entered a left turn and descended from 12,600 feet to 12,100 feet.
Between 1622:40 and 1623:28, the airplane started another right turn and descended from 12,100 feet to 11,900 feet.
Between 1623:28 and 1625:52, the airplane made a 360-degree right turn, descending from 11,900 feet to 11,100 feet.
At this point, radar returns became sporadic.
At 1627:18, a radar return at 10,600 feet was detected to the north.
At 1627:37, another radar return at 10,400 feet was detected.
This was the last known radar contact with the airplane.
These latter radar returns indicated the airplane was still in a right circling turn.
At 1817, satellites began picking up an ELT (emergency locator transmitter) signals from an area north-northeast of Laramie.
Denver ARTCC issued an ALNOT (alert notice) at 2234.
Ground search and rescue teams, working through the night, located the wreckage approximately 1100 the next morning at a location of 41 degrees, 25'24" north latitude, and 105 degrees, 29'48" west longitude, at an elevation of 8,461 feet.
The radar return at 1627:39 was at a position of 41 degrees, 51'35" north latitude, and 106 degrees, 07'31" west longitude and 10,500 feet.
The first ground strike was at a location of 41 degrees, 25.772' north latitude, and 105 degrees, 28.518' west longitude, and 8,491 feet, a difference of 44.5 miles and 2,909 feet.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION N210HC (s/n 210-62536), a model T210M, was manufactured by the Cessna Aircraft Company, Wichita, Kansas, in March 1978.
It was equipped with a Continental TSIO-520-R engine (s/n 512651), rated at 310 horsepower, and a McCauley D3A34C402 all metal, 3-blade, constant-speed propeller (s/n 805480).
This SIGMET reported an area of thunderstorms (50ENE SLC-40NE BCE-10SW PGS-60SSE ILC-503N3 ALC) moving from 240 degrees at 30 knots, with tops to FL350 (35,000 feet).
The area of thunderstorms was not in the vicinity of N210HC.
It was requested that NTSB's Engineering Division conduct a weather study in support of this investigation.
The meteorologist's factual report is attached as an exhibit to this report.

The clock has stopped at 4:38.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION An autopsy (#AO 02-11) was performed on the pilot at the McKee Medical Center in Longmont, Colorado.
FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City performed a toxicological screen.
According to CAMI's report (#200200280001), no carbon monoxide or cyanide was detected in blood samples, and no ethanol was detected in the urine.
Quinine, however, was detected in the urine.
According to his wife, the pilot was taking prescribed quinine sulfate for the treatment of muscle cramps in his leg.
TESTS AND RESEARCH The engine was examined at Beegles Aircraft Services, Greeley, Colorado, on November 2, 2002.
All hoses, cables and wires were stretched or broken.
A West Star Aviation Gold Star tag was attached to the case.
There was extensive impact engine damage, especially to the bottom front case, which was broken.
The engine was pushed back into the firewall.
The oil sump and cooler were crushed up and aft against the engine.
Disassembly of the oil sump revealed no metal particles, and the screen was clean.
The oil filter and induction tubing were crushed.
The main fuel supply line between the fuel pump and fuel control unit (FCU) contained fuel, as did the fuel pump.
It turned freely and the coupler was intact.
The FCU was unremarkable.
The spring and diaphragm were intact, and there was fuel in the chamber.
The screen was dry and clean.
The throttle body was also crushed up and aft against the engine, and the butterfly valve was jammed closed.
The camshaft and lifters were unremarkable.
Turning the crankshaft revealed continuity to the accessory section.
There was "thumb compression" on all cylinders.
The no.
6 rocker box cover was broken open, exposing broken cylinder parts.

The impeller and turbine turned freely with no FOD (foreign object debris/damage) noted on the blades.
The propeller hub was fractured with the rear portion remaining attached to the flange.
The propeller governor was hanging from the control linkage.
The starter was knocked off.
The top spark plug (Champion RHB32E) electrodes were clean, exhibited normal wear patterns, but were ready for changing.
Both magnetos remained attached to their mounting pads, and provided spark to the top spark plugs.
Vacuum pump disassembly revealed a cracked rotor, but the vanes and coupler were intact.
Electrical power was applied to the damaged nav/comm radios after they had been removed from the instrument panel.
The only useful information recovered was from the no.
2 communications radio, which was tuned to 118.7 MHz.
It could not be determined if this was an active or standby frequency.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION According to the pilot's son, his father normally filed IFR flight plans and flew in the IFR "system" to stay current with instrument procedures and controller phraseology but, as a rule, he avoided flying in actual instrument meteorological conditions.
In addition to the Federal Aviation Administration, parties to the investigation included the Cessna Aircraft Company, and Teledyne-Continental Motors.
The wreckage was released to the insurance company's adjuster on October 3, 2002.
