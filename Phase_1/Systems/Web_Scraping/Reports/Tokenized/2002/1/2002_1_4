 Analysis According to the Captain, during the first phase of pushback, everything appeared normal.
The first and second officers were completing the engine start check and the airplane was being pushed back from the gate when the airplane came to a stop.
The tug operator stated that during pushback, the airplane nose wheel hit a patch of ice.
As he applies brakes to stop the tug,  the airplane began to slide.
Unable to stop the movement, the tug driver jumped from the tug to avoid getting caught between the tug and airplane.
The tug came to rest lodged under the fuselage of the airplane creating a 10-inch by 14-inch hole in the underside of the fuselage breaking two stringers.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The tug driver's failure to maintain control of the airplane during pushback resulting in the tug colliding with the airplane.
A factor was ice on the ramp.

The tug came to rest lodged under the fuselage of the airplane creating a 10-inch by 14-inch hole in the underside of the fuselage.
The examination of the airframe revealed that two stringers on the bottom side were damaged.
.
Witnesses stated that after deicing the airplane, the tug operator began to pushback the airplane.
The parking area was clear of ice but the ramp was slick.
The tug operator parked the airplane on the taxi line at a 90-degree angle from the tug and engaged the brakes.
According to the operator, "due to the ice on the ramp, the momentum of the tug caused the tug to slide into the airplane."
