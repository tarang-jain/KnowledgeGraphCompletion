Accident Number: MIA02LA165
Date & Time: 09/01/2002, 1253 EDT
Registration: N33N
Aircraft: Cessna T337D
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot stated that he estimated that at takeoff the airplane had about 35 gallons of fuel on board, and after about 45 minutes, while in cruise flight, at an altitude of 4500 feet, the front engine suddenly ceased operating.
He stated that he had experienced problems in the past with water in the fuel tanks, so he did not declare an emergency, even after unsuccessful attempts to restart the engine.
He said the airplane was maintaining 120 knots, and fully controllable while being only powered by the rear engine.
He said that in his mind,  it was only water in the left tank, and his destination,  Fort Pierce, Florida,  was only 10 miles away, so he continued to his destination.
He said the only area to land was a small field on the right, so he turned 90 degrees, and entered a dive to prevent the airplane from stalling.
The aircraft impacted in an orange grove, rebounded once,  and then stopped in a canal.
