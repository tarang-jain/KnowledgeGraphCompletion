Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 5 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Scheduled
 Analysis The commercial certificated pilot was on final approach for landing at a remote airport during a scheduled domestic passenger flight.
The airplane was about 300 feet above the ground, with 15 degrees of flaps, and an airspeed of about 80 knots.
The pilot said that the airplane's airspeed seemed too fast, so he reduced engine power.
The airplane's airspeed then became too slow, so he increased engine power, but the airplane collided with terrain short of the runway threshold.
The airplane received damage to the nose gear, propeller, and left wing.
The runway is 4,422 feet long, by 100 feet wide.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The failure of the pilot-in-command to maintain the proper glide path to the runway during the final approach for a VFR landing.
