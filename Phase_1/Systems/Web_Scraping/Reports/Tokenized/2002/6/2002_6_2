Accident Number: CHI02TA149
Date & Time: 06/01/2002, 1340 CDT
Registration: N185NR
Aircraft: Cessna A185F
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Public Aircraft
 Analysis The airplane was substantially damaged when it veered off the runway during landing rollout on runway 18 (2,700 feet by 60 feet, asphalt).
The pilot reported that a gust of wind forced the aircraft to turn right and that full left rudder and braking could not straighten the aircraft.
The pilot stated that he allowed the rollout to continue onto the grass along side the runway, when the left main landing gear sank in sand.
The pilot reported the winds at the time of the accident were from 240 degrees at 13 knots gusting to 18 knots.
The maximum demonstrated crosswind for a 1977 Cessna A185F is 15 kts.
There is no published maximum demonstrated crosswind for the accident airplane, which was a 1973 Cessna A185F.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: Directional control of the airplane not maintained by the pilot.
The gusting winds was a contributing factor.
Findings Occurrence #1: ON GROUND/WATER ENCOUNTER WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: LANDING - ROLL Findings 1.
(F) WEATHER CONDITION - GUSTS 2.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.
The 14 CFR Part 91 public-use flight was not operating on a flight plan.
The airline transport pilot reported no injuries.
The flight originated from the Wittman Regional Airport, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, at 1115 and was en route to DAF.
The pilot stated in a written statement, "...After touchdown the aircraft was caught by a violent gust of wind forcing the aircraft into a turn to the right.
Full left rudder and braking was applied and was insufficient to halt the turning momentum/force of the wind.
Pilot then elected to allow roll out to continue on adjacent grass area.
When the aircraft left the runway the left main landing gear sunk into the sand causing the aircraft to go up on the nose and left wing coming to a stop."
The pilot reported the winds, at the time of the accident, were from 240 degrees at 13 knots gusting to 18 knots.
The maximum demonstrated crosswind for a 1977 Cessna A185F is 15 kts.
There is no published maximum demonstrated crosswind for the accident airplane, which was a 1973 Cessna A185F.
