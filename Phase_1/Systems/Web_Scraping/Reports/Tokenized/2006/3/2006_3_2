Aircraft: Piper PA-32RT-300T
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 2 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Business
 Analysis The pilot said "the engine began to surge in power slightly as the airplane was rotated for liftoff from runway 03.
During climbout, he notified the tower of a "possible engine problem," and the engine continued surging.
As the pilot executed a slow left turn towards runway 13, the engine started losing power.
He managed to land on runway 13 near the intersection with runway 03-21.
The airplane was not aligned with the runway centerline, and went off the side of the runway.
The left wing struck an elevated runway marker and taxiway lights.
Both wing spars were damaged and the left wing was twisted down.
An FAA airworthiness inspector examined the airplane and engine and reported finding an exposed left magneto "P" lead touching the connector shell.
This could "cause an intermittent grounding of the left magneto," and result in the "fuel control[er] hunting to compensate [and] producing an engine power surge."
Contributing factors were the runway sign and taxiway lights.
