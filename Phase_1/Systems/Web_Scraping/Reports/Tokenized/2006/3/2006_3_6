Registration: N3511V
Aircraft: Beech V35B
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 2 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot did not ensure that the snow that had accumulated on the aircraft both prior to and after he began the taxi sequence was fully removed from the aircraft's wings prior to takeoff.
During the takeoff, the aircraft did not lift off as it normally does, and the takeoff roll ended up being longer than usual.
Once the pilot got the aircraft in the air, it was not climbing at an acceptable rate, so the pilot retracted the landing gear because he thought that action would help the aircraft to climb.
Soon after the landing gear was retracted, the aircraft settled back onto the runway, hit a runway light, and then slid off the departure end of the runway onto a snow and ice covered field.
According to the pilot, the engine was producing full power and was running very smoothly.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from the terrain during the takeoff sequence.
