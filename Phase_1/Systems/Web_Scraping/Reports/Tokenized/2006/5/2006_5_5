 Analysis The pilot stated that during his return flight the tail rotor chip detector light flickered and then came on and stayed on.
He said he was familiar with the flight area and knew there was a fire department near his intended landing site.
He elected to perform a precautionary landing near the fire department to inspect the helicopter.
During the landing he failed to observe a TV transmission line, struck the line, nosed down from about 5-feet AGL, rolled to the left and impacted the ground.
The pilot further stated that he was "impacted by a strong lateral wind gust from the east which swung the tail rotor into the low hanging cable.
