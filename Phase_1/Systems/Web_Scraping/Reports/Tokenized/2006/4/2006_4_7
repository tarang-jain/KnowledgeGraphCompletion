 Analysis While transitioning from landing to taxiing the pilot experienced a bumping sound, which was followed by the collapse of the nose gear.
Examination of photographs of the damage revealed that several inches of the nose fuselage structure had been ground down by contact with the runway pavement.
The nose gear was examined by an airframe and power plant (A&P) mechanic.
The mechanic reported that the nose gear drive tube was bent inboard 90 degrees, suggesting that the nose over center adjustment was out of tolerance, and a sufficient impact could cause the gear to unlock from the down position.
There was no evidence of mechanical failure or foreign object damage.
