 Analysis The airplane veered off the runway and nosed over.
Prior to departure the pilot obtained a full weather briefing, but there was no information regarding the surface winds at his destination airport.
The pilot stated that the approach was normal, despite the crosswind conditions.
Just prior to touchdown a strong gust blew the airplane to the left side of the runway.
He attempted to execute a go-around by adding full power, but the airplane was unable to get airborne due to the strong wind conditions.
The airplane touched down off the runway surface and nosed over, coming to rest inverted.
The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane.
