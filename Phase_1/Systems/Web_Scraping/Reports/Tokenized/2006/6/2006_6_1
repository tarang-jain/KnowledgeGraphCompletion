 Analysis The airplane was taking off on an aerial application flight.
Shortly after lifting off, the airplane's engine lost power.
The commercial pilot set the airplane down on the runway toward the departure end.
The airplane went off the end of the runway and into a wheat field.
The airplane's main gear tires sank into the soft wet soil and the airplane subsequently nosed over causing the engine to fracture and separate from the fuselage and crushing the vertical stabilizer and rudder downward.
The pilot sustained minor injuries.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.
An examination of the airplane's engine revealed that the rocker arm boss on the number 1 cylinder had fractured leaving the exhaust valve on the cylinder closed and resulting in the subsequent engine failure.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The broken rocker arm boss causing the number 1 cylinder exhaust valve to stay closed and subsequently the engine failed.
A factor contributing to the accident was the soft field the airplane set down in.
