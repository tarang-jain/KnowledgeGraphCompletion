 Analysis The single-engine agricultural airplane collided with a set of power transmission lines while performing an aerial application flight.
The 15,000-hour pilot sustained serious injuries and the airplane was destroyed.
During an interview with a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, the pilot stated that prior to the accident the airplane was operating "fine."
However, the pilot added that he had "no recollection" of the accident.
The FAA inspector reported that there were two sets of wires, a small local line and a set of tall, high-power transmission lines.
The pilot also told the inspector that the normal practice for them was to fly over both lines before descending to perform the application run.
The FAA inspector reported that he found a portion of the lower right wing resting near the location of the high power lines.
The visibility at the time of the accident was reported at 10 statute miles, with no obstructions.
