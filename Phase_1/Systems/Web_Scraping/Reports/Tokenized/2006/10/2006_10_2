Registration: N5950X
Aircraft: Brantly Helicopter B-2
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis According to the pilot, during the attempted takeoff, he raised the collective and the helicopter "became light on its skids."
The pilot verified the wind conditions based on his observation with nearby trees.
The wind was observed to be "light" and from the south-southwest direction.
The pilot initiated a turn into the direction of the wind, and prior to transitional lift, the rotor RPM dropped.
The pilot attempted to recover the drop in rotor RPM by lowering the collective.
The helicopter skids touched the terrain, and the helicopter rolled over on it's right side.
The pilot stated, "I believe I got a wind gust that contributed to the low [rotor] RPM."
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control during takeoff.
A contributing factor was the low rotor RPM.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - IN FLIGHT Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF Findings 1.
(C) AIRCRAFT CONTROL - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND 2.
