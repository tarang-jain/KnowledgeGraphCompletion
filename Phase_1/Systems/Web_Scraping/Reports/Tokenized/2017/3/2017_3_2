 Analysis The student pilot reported that, during a solo flight, he was performing takeoffs and full-stop landings in the traffic pattern.
During the landing roll, he configured the flaps to 0 and applied full power.
The airplane pulled to the left, and he overcompensated the right rudder pedal application.
"In an immediate reaction to reverse this I applied left rudder to quickly and went immediately to far left causing a fishtailing effect."
The airplane exited the runway to the left and struck runway signage and a fence.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing, the landing gear attachment points, the horizontal stabilizer, and the elevator.
The student pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The student pilot's overcompensation of right rudder pedal application during the landing roll, which resulted in a loss of directional control and impact with runway signage and a fence.
