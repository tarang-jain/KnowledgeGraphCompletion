 Analysis The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, while landing on a road in gusting crosswind conditions, the right wing lifted to about a 60Â° angle.
He immediately initiated a go- around and added full power and right aileron and lowered the nose.
The airplane had drifted off the center of the road to the left heading toward power lines, and the pilot chose to go under them.
After the airplane cleared the power lines, the left wing tip struck the ground, and the airplane cart-wheeled.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings, the fuselage, and the empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during a go-around.
