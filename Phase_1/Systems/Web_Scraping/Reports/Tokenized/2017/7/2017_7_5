On July 1, 2017, about 2118 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 152, N49453, was destroyed when 
it descended and impacted terrain in Everglades National Park, Homestead, Florida. The

consistent with the airplane were tracked from the first target located just past the departure 
end of runway 9R. The airplane then turned to the southwest and flew west of Miami 
Homestead General Aviation Airport (X51). The airplane then proceeded due west of X51, 
where, orbits consistent with a procedure turn and instrument holding procedures were noted. 
The last radar target at 2118, at an altitude of 950 ft msl, on a heading of 324° was noted at
