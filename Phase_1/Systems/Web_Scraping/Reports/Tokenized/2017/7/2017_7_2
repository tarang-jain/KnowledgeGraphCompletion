Location: Monticello, IA
Accident Number: CEN17FA249
Date & Time: 07/01/2017, 1603 CDT
Registration: N62JN
Aircraft: FLIGHT DESIGN GMBH CTSW
Injuries: 1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On July 1, 2017, about 1603 central daylight time, a Flight Design CTSW single-engine light 
sport airplane, N62JN, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain while landing at 
Monticello Regional Airport (MXO), Monticello, Iowa. The commercial pilot was fatally 
injured, and his dog sustained minor injuries. The airplane was registered to Mooney of 
Monticello Inc. and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 
Code of Federal 
Regulations
 (CFR) Part 91 without a flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed 
for the local flight that departed MXO about 1515.
A witness, who was a pilot practicing takeoffs and landings on runway 27 at MXO, reported 
that the accident airplane had approached the airport from the east before entering a left 
downwind for runway 27. He observed the accident airplane on its final approach to runway 
27; however, the witness lost visual contact with the airplane when he entered his base turn for 
runway 27. The witness reported that, when his airplane was established on final for runway 
27, he did not see the accident airplane on the runway or taxiway so he performed a go-around. 
During the go-around he spotted the accident airplane in the cornfield adjacent to the runway.
At 1655, the MXO automated surface observing system reported: wind 280° at 13 knots, few 
clouds at 5,500 feet above ground level (agl), 10 miles surface visibility; temperature 24°C; dew
