 Analysis On December 3, 2017, about 1825 eastern standard time, American Airlines flight 1531, an Airbus 319, N9011P, collided with American Airlines flight 1613, a Boeing 737-800, N344PP, on a taxiway at Miami International Airport (KMIA), Miami, Florida.
There were no injuries to the occupants of either airplane and N344PP was substantially damaged.
Both flights were scheduled passenger flights operating under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 121.
N9011P originated from Toncontín International Airport (MHTG), Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and had 126 passengers and crew onboard.
N344PP originated from Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (TJSJ), San Juan, Puerto Rico, and had 168 passengers and crew onboard.
According to flight crew statements, N344PP had landed on runway 09 and was instructed to turn onto taxiway N5 from taxiway M. The captain set the parking brake as they waited for preceding traffic to clear.
N9011P was following N344PP along taxiway M and observed N344PP stop on the taxiway N5 with its tail partially blocking taxiway M. After several minutes of waiting, N9011P requested permission to taxi past N344PP, which was granted.
As the Captain of N9011P slowly taxied, the first officer (FO) attempted to visually monitor clearance between their airplanes wingtip and N344PPs horizontal stabilizer.
The FO stated that he was temporarily blinded by the glare from the ramp lights and the airplanes collided.
N9011P received minor damage to its right wingtip and the lower spar of N344PP's horizontal stabilizer was fractured.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The failure of the flight crew of N9011P to maintain an appropriate clearance from N344PP, which was stopped on the taxiway.
