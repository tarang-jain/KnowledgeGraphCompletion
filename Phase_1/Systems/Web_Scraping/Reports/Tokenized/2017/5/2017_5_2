 Analysis The student pilot reported that, during crosswind landing conditions, the airplane landed hard and subsequently bounced.
He added that he initiated a go-around, and then the flight instructor took the flight controls.
The flight instructor reported that, after the bounce, the airplane "began to roll to the left in a manner similar to that of an uncoordinated stall."
He added that he attempted to regain control of the airplane but was unsuccessful.
The airplane rolled right, and the right wing impacted the ground.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings.
The flight instructor reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation station located about 7 miles north of the airport reported that, about 1 minute before the accident, the wind was from 150Â° at 11 knots.
The airplane landed on runway 24.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The student pilot's failure to adequately compensate for crosswind conditions during a go- around and the flight instructor's delayed remedial action.
