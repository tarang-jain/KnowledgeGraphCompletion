Location: McCoy, TX
Accident Number: CEN18LA002
Date & Time: 10/02/2017, 1515 CDT
Registration: N818PB
Aircraft: CHARLES A BRAZIL MTO SPORT
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Collision during takeoff/land
Injuries: 1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On October 2, 2017, about 1515 central daylight time, an MTO Sport gyroplane, N818PB, 
impacted a power line and terrain near McCoy, Texas. The student rated pilot received serious 
injuries and the gyrocopter was substantially damaged during the accident. The gyrocopter was 
registered to and operated by a private individual under the provisions of 14 
Code of Federal 
Regulations
 Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time. 
The pilot reported to the responding Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector that he 
planned to land near his residence. The pilot reported that he made a normal approach near 
the power lines; however, a gust of wind pushed the gyrocopter downward and the left landing 
gear caught the power line. The pilot lost control of the gyrocopter and it impacted a roadway 
and came to rest on its right side. The main rotor had separated from the mast and substantial 
damaged was noted to the fuselage. The Hobbs meter read 47.92 hours.
A review of FAA records revealed that the pilot purchased the kit in January 2017, and the 
gyrocopter received its airworthiness certificate on September 4, 2017.
The pilot did not return a completed Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident form (NTSB 6120.1).
