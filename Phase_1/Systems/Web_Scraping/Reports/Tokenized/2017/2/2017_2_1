Aviation Accident Factual Report
Location: Anthony, NM
Accident Number: CEN17LA098
Date & Time: 02/01/2017, 1536 MST
Registration: N294MV
Aircraft: ROBINSON MICHAEL E COZY MARK
IV
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries: 2 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On February 1, 2017, about 1536 mountain standard time, an experimental amateur-built Cozy 
Mark IV airplane, N294MV, was substantially damaged during a forced landing near Anthony, 
New Mexico. The airline transport pilot and private pilot were not injured. The airplane was 
registered to and operated by a private individual under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the 
local flight, which had recently departed from Cielo Dorado Estates Airport (NM05), Santa 
Teresa, New Mexico.
The two pilots had been flying about 90 minutes, during which they accomplished several 
approaches in the local area. While executing a go-around from NM05, the private pilot 
applied full power and began a climb. About 400 ft above ground level, the pilots noticed a 
total and abrupt loss of engine power. Based on their perception that the power loss was due to 
a fuel issue, the pilots turned the fuel boost pump on and adjusted the mixture control, with no 
effect. The airline transport pilot accomplished a forced landing into a field, during which the 
right wing and fuselage were damaged.
The accident occurred on the second flight of the amateur-built airplane, which was equipped 
with a Lycoming IO-360-C1C fuel injected engine. Examination at the accident site by a 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed adequate fuel was present in both 
the left and right fuel tanks, with the fuel selector in the right tank position. 
At the recovery location, a mechanic's examination revealed that all fuel lines and the fuel filter 
were intact and unobstructed. A small amount of sanding dust was observed in the fuel filter. 
The fuel boost pump was tested and determined to be operational. The fuel flow divider was 
removed and disassembled, which revealed a small amount of sanding dust. A flow check was 
conducted on the fuel nozzles, with no blockages or anomalies. During rotation of the 
propeller, the engine displayed normal continuity and magneto operation. No engine or fuel 
system anomalies were discovered that would have resulted in a loss of engine power.
