On February 1, 2017, about 1410 Pacific standard time, a Beech 95-B55 airplane, N321BJ, 
experienced a landing gear failure shortly after takeoff from the Cameron Airpark (O61), 
Cameron Park, California. The pilot (sole occupant) was not injured and the airplane sustained 
substantial damage to the fuselage structure. The airplane was registered to, and operated by, 
the pilot as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the local flight that departed at about 
1300. 
The pilot reported that when he raised the landing gear shortly after takeoff, he heard a loud 
crunch when the gear entered the gear wells. The pilot climbed the airplane to about 3,000 feet 
and observed that the landing gear circuit breaker was popped and the alternator was off. The 
pilot attempted to extend the landing gear normally several times, however, the circuit breaker 
popped each time and the gear remained retracted. The pilot also attempted to use the 
emergency gear extension, however, to no avail. The airplane was landed with the landing gear 
retracted.
