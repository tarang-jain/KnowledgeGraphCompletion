Location: St. Petersburg, FL
Accident Number: ERA17LA306
Date & Time: 09/01/2017, 1036 EDT
Registration: N753GK
Aircraft: KERR GERALD VELOCITY SUV
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Landing area overshoot
Injuries: 2 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On September 1, 2017, about 1036 eastern daylight time, an experimental amateur-built 
Velocity SUV, N753GK, was substantially damaged while attempting to land at Albert Whitted 
Airport (SPG), St. Petersburg, Florida. The private pilot and the passenger were not injured. 
The airplane was registered to a private company and operated by the pilot as a 14 
Code of 
Federal Regulations 
Part 91 personal flight. No flight plan was filed for the flight that departed 
the Sebastian Municipal Airport (X26), Sebastian, Florida, about 0930.
The pilot stated that he was aware of cranes near the approach end of the runway 18 and made 
sure he was high enough to clear them. The approach to land was steeper and faster than 
normal. He landed the airplane long and in instead of going around, he continued with the 
landing. The airplane went off the runway and into Tampa Bay, which resulted in substantial 
damage to the fuselage. The pilot said there were no mechanical problems with the airplane 
and that accident was caused by his "bad choices" and a "mistake in judgment" to continue 
with the landing.
The pilot held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land. His last 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) third-class medical was issued on December 5, 2011. 
The pilot said that he lost his logbook in the accident and reported a total of 525 to 600 flight 
hours. He built the airplane in 2002 and started flying it in 2003. He estimated he has flown 
the airplane about 40 hours per year since 2003.
The pilot also said all the maintenance logbooks and paperwork for the airplane were lost in 
the accident. He did not know the exact date of the last inspection but recalled completing an 
"annual" in early 2017.
Weather reported at the airport at 0953, was wind from 170° at 6 knots, visibility 10 miles, 
clear skies, temperature 31°C, dew point 24°C, and an altimeter setting of 30.03 inches of 
mercury.
