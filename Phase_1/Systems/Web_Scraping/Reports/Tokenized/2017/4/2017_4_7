 Analysis The pilot reported that, during approach and after fully extending the flaps, he felt the airplane was descending too quickly, so he added power.
He added that "the aircraft was nearly down when [a] crosswind" drifted the airplane off the runway centerline.
The pilot added more power, but the stall warning horn sounded, and the nose dropped.
The airplane impacted a drainage pond to the left of the runway and came to rest inverted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
