Location: MADERA, CA
Accident Number: LAX98LA099
Date & Time: 03/01/1998, 1641 PST
Registration: N546SH
Aircraft: Sweet-House RD MUSTANG 2
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot reported that he was on approach to runway 30.
As he initiated the flare, he felt the airplane bleed off airspeed quicker than anticipated and realized that 'the aircraft was quickly starting to stall.'
The pilot stated that he knew that he was too high and applied power to arrest the stall but the left wing dropped and seemed to start flying again when power was applied.
The pilot then attempted to abort the landing and execute a go-around but the aircraft veered to the left off the runway.
The left wingtip contacted the ground, followed by the engine and right wing.
The right wing broke off at the wing splice point and the aircraft nosed over and came to rest inverted.
The pilot reported that at the time of the accident he had logged only 1 hour in this type of aircraft.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The failure of the pilot to maintain adequate airspeed during the approach, which resulted in a stall.
An additional cause was the pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the attempted go around.
A factor in this accident is the pilot's lack of total experience in aircraft type.

The pilot reported that he was on approach to runway 30.
As he initiated the flare, he felt "the airplane bleed off airspeed quicker than anticipated," and realized that "the aircraft was quickly starting to stall."
The pilot reported that he "knew that [he] was too high and applied power to arrest the stall [but] the left wing dropped [and] seemed to start flying again when power was applied."
The pilot further reported that he then attempted to abort the landing and execute a go-around but the aircraft veered to the left off the runway.
The left wingtip impacted the ground and the pilot reported that he then "had no control over the aircraft."
The propeller and engine then impacted the ground and the right wing broke off at the wing splice point.
The aircraft nosed over and came to rest inverted.
The pilot reported that at the time of the accident he had logged only 1 hour in this type of aircraft.
