 Analysis The pilot of the other airplane was taxiing for departure on a north-south taxiway for a departure from runway 18R.
He reported that the ATIS advised all traffic to watch the flagmen for ATC instructions.
The pilot reported that he was watching the flagman as instructed.
The pilot reported, 'The flagman gave me a signal to stop as I approached the intersection, and then changed to the right turn signal.
I started my right turn.
The flagman gave me no indication that there was an aircraft in my path, or that I should do anything other than complete the turn.'
He reported that he was about halfway through the turn when his propeller struck the right wingtip of the RV-6.
He reported, 'I was confident that this area was clear because the flagman, with a clear view, directed me to make the turn.'
The pilot of the RV-6 was not aware of the conflict until the Cessna's propeller hit the right wing and aileron of his airplane.
