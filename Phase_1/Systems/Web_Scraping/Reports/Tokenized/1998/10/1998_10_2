 Analysis When the pilot turned onto final approach to runway 21, he had to lower the left wing and apply right rudder to maintain runway alignment.
He said the wind had generally been from the south between 15 and 18 knots.
As the airplane touched down, a wind gust 'in excess of 20 knots cocked the airplane to the left,' causing the right main landing gear to buckle and separate.
According to a Cessna Airplane Company spokesperson, the airplane owner's manual contains no maximum crosswind component data.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control.
