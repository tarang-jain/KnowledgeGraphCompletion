Registration: N4832R
Aircraft: Cessna 188B
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under: Part 137: Agricultural
 Analysis The pilot was approaching from the northeast for a swath spray, waiting to fly over power lines that intersected a cotton field at the arrival end.
The pilot thought that he was clear to push over into the cotton field to start his spray run.
However, he was not completely clear of the power lines and on the push over became entangled with the ridge wire that runs from one pole to another giving the poles stability.
The wire tangled between the propeller blades and around the propeller shaft slowing the engine to a stop.
While tethered by the cable the aircraft fell approximately 250 to 300 feet, striking a slope and turning almost 180 degrees from the direction of impact.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from a utility line while conducting a swath run.
