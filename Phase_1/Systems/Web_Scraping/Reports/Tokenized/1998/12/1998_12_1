LANDING GEAR,MAIN GEAR - OVERLOAD Factual Information On December 1, 1998, at 1650 eastern standard time, a Piper PA- 28-181, N36700, operated by a private pilot collided with the terrain during an off airport forced landing 2 miles east of the Jewett Airport, Mason, Michigan.

The 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions.
The flight originated from Muskegon, Michigan.
The pilot departed Mason, Michigan, at 1445 est and flew to Muskegon, Michigan, where he made a touch and go landing prior to heading back to Mason.
The pilot reported that while at 1,800 feet, on base leg for landing on runway 27 at the Jewett Airport, the engine lost power.
The pilot landed the airplane in an open field during which time the right main landing gear collapsed.
Post accident inspection of the airplane revealed the right fuel tank was empty and the left fuel tank was full.
The airplane had been refueled prior to departing Mason, Michigan.
The hobbs time at departure was 3260.5 and the hobbs time noted at the accident site was 3262.5.

He reported, "Although high power was not attempted, the engine ran satisfactorily."
In a written statement to the FAA, the pilot stated, "I believe that the right fuel tank was not switched in a timely manner which led to the fuel starvation to the engine and the eventual forced landing."
