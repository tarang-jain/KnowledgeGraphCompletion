Registration: N159MK
Aircraft: KERR STARTDUSTER TOO
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 2 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot reported the airplane swerved and skidded sideways off the runway during the landing roll.
The airplane traveled onto a taxiway where it contacted a 3 to 4 inch rise between the grass and the pavement.
The right main landing gear collapsed then the rise was contacted.
The pilot/builder reported the loss of directional control was a result of an under inflated tailwheel.
He reported it should have been inflated to 38 psi due to the extra weight of having a passenger on board.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the pilot's failure to assure the tailwheel tire had adequate pressure which resulted in his inability to maintain directional control of the airplane during a landing.
Factors associated with the accident were the inadequate pressure and the uneven terrain contacted by the landing gear.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - ON GROUND/WATER Phase of Operation: LANDING - ROLL Findings 1.
(F) LANDING GEAR,TIRE - PRESSURE TOO LOW 2.
(C) MAINTENANCE,PRESSURIZING - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND 3.
(C) DIRECTIONAL CONTROL - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND ---------- Occurrence #2: MAIN GEAR COLLAPSED Phase of Operation: LANDING - ROLL Findings 4.
(F) TERRAIN CONDITION - ROUGH/UNEVEN 5.
LANDING GEAR,MAIN GEAR ATTACHMENT - OVERLOAD Factual Information On July 1, 1998, at 1520 eastern daylight time, a Starduster Too, N159MK, operated by a private pilot experienced a right main gear collapse while landing at the Bay City Clements Municipal Airport, Bay City, Michigan.
The pilot and passenger were not injured.
The airplane was substantially damaged.
The 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions.
The flight originated from the Bay City Clements Municipal Airport at 1415 eastern daylight time.
The pilot reported that upon landing he lost directional control of the airplane.
He stated the airplane swerved on the runway, then skidded sideways off the side of the runway.
The airplane then traveled onto a taxiway where it contacted a 3 to 4 inch rise between the grass and the pavement.
The right main landing gear collapsed then the rise was contacted.
The pilot/builder reported the loss of directional control was a result of an under inflated tailwheel.
He reported it should have been inflated to 38 psi due to the extra weight of having a passenger on board.
Inspection of the airplane by an Inspector from the Federal Aviation Administration Grand Rapids, Michigan, Flight Standards District Office revealed the right main landing gear separated at the attachment weld.
When the right main gear collapsed the lower right wing contacted the terrain.
This resulted in a failure of the right lower wing rear spar.
