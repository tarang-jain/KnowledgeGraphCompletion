Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: FORT PIERCE, FL
Accident Number: MIA98LA117
Date & Time: 04/02/1998, 1400 EST
Registration: DECTB
Aircraft: Beech F33A
Aircraft Damage: Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The flight had departed runway 14, and had reached an altitude of about 200 feet, when  the pilot reported a loss of engine power.
The pilot elected to make a forced landing straight ahead into trees.
After impact, the pilot closed off the fuel valve.
Examination of the wreckage after the accident revealed that the fuel tanks had fuel.
The pilot said the fuel selector was on the left tank when the loss of power occurred.
Observation of the engine at the crash site did not reveal any obvious discrepancies.
The engine was removed from the airframe and examined at the NTSB's request, and under the supervision of the FAA, on June 24, 1998.
The engine examination revealed that the fuel control system exhibited fluid leakage at the fuel pump and throttle shaft.
Detailed examination of the fuel pump showed that the pump leaked fluid at the rear high speed adjusting needle at the seal to the pump body.
There was no evidence of impact damage observed on the fuel pump.
In addition, the throttle/metering unit leaked fluid at the throttle shaft into the metering unit.
The leak at the throttle shaft was severe enough that no flow test was possible.
The throttle arm displayed impact damage.
The throttle shaft was removed from the unit, and the 'O' ring seal was found flat from wear.
The 'O' ring was replaced and the leakage stopped.
The unit was then flow tested to manufacturer's standards.

(C) FUEL SYSTEM,FUEL CONTROL - LEAK ---------- Occurrence #2: FORCED LANDING Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY DESCENT/LANDING ---------- Occurrence #3: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH OBJECT Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY DESCENT/LANDING Findings 2.
OBJECT - TREE(S) Factual Information On April 2, 1998, about 1400 eastern standard time, a Beech F33A, D-ECTB (German), registered to a private individual, operating as a Title 14 CFR Part 91 local personal flight, impacted with trees during a forced landing near Fort Pierce, Florida.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed.
The airplane was destroyed.
The private- rated pilot was not injured.
The flight was originating from the Fort Pierce Airport at the time.
The flight had departed runway 14, and had reached an altitude of about 200 feet, when the pilot reported a loss of engine power.
The pilot elected to make a forced landing straight ahead into trees.
After impact, the pilot closed off the fuel valve.
Examination of the wreckage after the accident revealed that the fuel tanks had fuel.
The pilot said the fuel selector was on the left tank when the loss of power occurred.
Observation of the engine at the crash site did not reveal any obvious discrepancies.
The engine was removed from the airframe and shipped to Continental Motor's facilities, Mobile, Alabama, and examined at the NTSB's request, and under the supervision of the FAA, on June 24, 1998.
The engine examination revealed that the fuel control system exhibited fluid leakage at the fuel pump and throttle shaft.
Detailed examination of the fuel pump showed that the pump leaked fluid at the rear high speed adjusting needle at the seal to the pump body.
There was no evidence of impact damage observed on the fuel pump.
In addition, the throttle/metering unit leaked fluid at the throttle shaft into the metering unit.
The leak at the throttle shaft was severe enough that no flow test was possible.
The throttle arm displayed impact damage.
The throttle shaft was removed from the unit, and the "O" ring seal was found flat from wear.
The ring was replaced and the leakage stopped.
The unit was then flow tested to manufacturer's standards.
No other discrepancies were found during the engine examination (see TCM Analytical report Page 3).
At the airplane owner's request, the engine was shipped to Fort Pierce, Florida, on July 23, 1998, directly from TCM, Mobile, Alabama.
