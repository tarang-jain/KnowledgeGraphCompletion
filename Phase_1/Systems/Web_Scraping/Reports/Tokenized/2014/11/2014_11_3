Location: Old Bridge, NJ
Accident Number: ERA15CA043
Date & Time: 11/03/2014, 1110 EST
Registration: N7102D
Aircraft: PIPER PA 22-150
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Loss of control on ground
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis According to the pilot, while in the landing flare, the tailwheel-equipped airplane began to roll to the left.
He applied right aileron to counteract the roll and provide wind correction; however, as the airplane decelerated during the landing roll, it lacked rudder authority to counteract a gust of wind from the right.
The airplane ground looped 180 degrees to the right, and the left main landing gear collapsed, resulting in substantial damage to the outboard portion of the left wing and left horizontal stabilizer.
The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Recorded wind velocity at a nearby airport about the time of the accident was 15 knots, with gusts to 25 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's loss of control while landing the tailwheel-equipped airplane in gusting wind conditions, which resulted in a ground loop.
