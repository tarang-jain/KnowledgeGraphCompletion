 Analysis The pilot reported that the wind was calm during his descent to landing.
He further stated that he was low and slow at about 150 to 200 feet above the ground when the airplane began to stall and he was too late to respond.
The airplane subsequently collided with terrain and came to rest short of the runway threshold.
During the accident sequence, the firewall and both wings sustained substantial damage.
The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's inadequate glide path and failure to maintain adequate airspeed during final approach, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
