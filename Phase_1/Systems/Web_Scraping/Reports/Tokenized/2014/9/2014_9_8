 Analysis While in cruise flight an unsecured jacket departed the helicopter through an open window.
The tail rotor drive shaft sheared as a result of the jacket's contact with the tail rotors.
The pilot subsequently initiated a forced landing to an orchard where during landing, the main rotors struck and separated the tailboom.
The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to adequately secure cargo (a jacket), which resulted in the jacket exiting the cabin compartment and colliding with the tail rotor during cruise flight.
