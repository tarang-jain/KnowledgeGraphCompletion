 Analysis The pilot reported that he decided to land at an en route airport to obtain fuel due to a stronger headwind than what was forecast for his route of flight.
The pilot made a normal landing to the north and turned west off the runway onto the first taxi.
He then made another turn to the north on the taxiway that paralleled the runway.
As he taxied beyond a row of trees that were to the west, the upwind wing of the airplane lifted and the airplane flipped inverted.
The rudder and left front wing strut were substantially damaged.
The pilot stated he was using proper crosswind taxi technique, but was unable to keep the wing down.
The wind conditions recorded at an airport located 37 miles away from the airport where the accident occurred were from 290 degrees at 16 knots gusting to 25 knots.
The pilot reported the local wind condition at the time of the accident was similar.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's inability to control the airplane while taxiing due to a strong crosswind condition.
