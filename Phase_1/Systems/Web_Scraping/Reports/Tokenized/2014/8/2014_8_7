 Analysis The pilot reported that while air-taxiing east about 15 feet above ground level (agl) to parking with adjoining buildings on both sides, which were known for buffeting winds that made it difficult to control the helicopter's yaw, he encountered a strong gust of wind.
The helicopter abruptly yawed to the right and he input left pedal control which did not correct the right yaw.
The helicopter continued rotating to the right at an increasing speed; full left pedal had no effect.
The pilot stated that the helicopter subsequently completed several 360-degree turns to the right, which rendered it completely uncontrollable; he abruptly lowered the collective from about 8 to 10 feet agl to get the helicopter on the ground.
During the descent the helicopter's left skid impacted the center of the taxiway, slid toward a fuel truck, and came to rest on its right side.
The main rotor blade impacted a fuel truck's windshield.
The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the tail boom and the upper and lower cabin/cockpit structure.
The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter that would have precluded normal operation.
