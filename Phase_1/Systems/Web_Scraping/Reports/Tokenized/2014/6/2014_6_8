Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot reported that he had intended to perform a touch-and-go landing in to the wind; however, traffic was landing and departing in the opposite direction on the 5,760-foot-long, 100-foot-wide, asphalt runway.
The pilot then listened to the automated surface observation system, which indicated the wind was variable and he elected to land in the direction of the other traffic.
During short final approach, the pilot noticed his airspeed was about 10 mph faster than normal and the airplane bounced after touchdown.
The pilot added power to cushion the second bounce and the airplane began to drift left toward the left side of the runway.
Before he could correct for the drift, the airplane bounced a second time.
The pilot then added full power to perform a go-around, but the airplane struck a runway sign off the left side of the runway and came to rest upright in a grass area between the runway and taxiway.
The pilot further stated that winds were light and variable and that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions with the airplane.
Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed damage to the firewall and horizontal stabilizer.
The recorded wind at the airport, about 30 minutes before and after the accident, was a right crosswind at 6 knots with a 10-degree tailwind component.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during a go-around after landing.
