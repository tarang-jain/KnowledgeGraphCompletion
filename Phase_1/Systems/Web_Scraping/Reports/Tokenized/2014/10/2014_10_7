Location: Atlanta, AR
Accident Number: CEN15CA007
Date & Time: 10/03/2014, 1330 CDT
Registration: N4426M
Aircraft: BELL 206B
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Dynamic rollover
Injuries: 1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Positioning
 Analysis The helicopter had been transported to a remote area with the skid landing gear secured to the helicopter transport trailer with four heavy duty ratchet type tie-downs.
After arrival at the work location the pilot and several ground crewmembers prepared the helicopter for an agricultural application flight.
The pilot reported that during his walk-around inspection prior to the flight he had overlooked the right rear tie-down, and he attempted to takeoff with the tie- down still attached to the helicopter.
As power was applied the helicopter immediately rolled to the right and impacted terrain.
Both main rotor blades were impact separated mid-span and the transmission and skid landing gear were partially separated.
The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the main rotor system, transmission, tail rotor, tail boom and fuselage.
A postaccident examination found no preimpact mechanical anomalies with the helicopter.
The characteristics displayed by the helicopter were indicative of it encountering a dynamic rollover.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's inadequate preflight inspection when he did not remove a tie-down strap prior to takeoff, which resulted in a dynamic rollover.
