 Analysis The flight instructor was conducting a biennial flight review for the private pilot\owner of the airplane.
The private pilot departed from the 5,008-foot-long runway, performed a touch-and- go landing without incident, and entered the traffic pattern for a simulated short-field landing.
While on short final, the airplane struck a berm that was located just prior to runway and sustained substantial damage to the landing gear and right wing.
The flight instructor stated that he realized that the airplane was low and expected the private pilot to add engine power; however, he did not attempt to manipulate the flight controls or provide any verbal instructions.
The private pilot stated that he also realized that the airplane was low, but did not react prior to contact with the ground.
Both pilots indicated that they did not experience any preaccident malfunctions or failures of the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The private pilot reported about 600 hours of total flight experience, which included about 475 hours in the same make and model as the accident airplane.
The flight instructor reported about 3,430 hours of total flight experience, which included about 200 hours in the same make and model as the accident airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The private pilot's failure to maintain proper altitude and the flight instructor's failure to provide correction action, which resulted in a collision with terrain during landing.
