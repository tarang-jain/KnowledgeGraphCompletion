 Analysis While departing the airport, the airplane's landing gear system failed to fully retract when actuated by the private pilot.
Several attempts were made by the pilot to fully lower the landing gear, including the use of the "emergency landing gear system."
The pilot elected to return to the airport and land in the grass parallel to the runway.
During the landing the airplane's firewall was damaged.
An inspection conducted on the airplane revealed that the wire cables which operate the landing gear were insufficiently lubricated during the previous annual inspection which was accomplished 18 days prior to the accident.
