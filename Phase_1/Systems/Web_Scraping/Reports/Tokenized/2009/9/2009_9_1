 Analysis The airplane was landing at a 2,100-foot-long dirt and turf remote mountain airstrip in dry conditions with clear skies and calm wind.
During the flare and initial touchdown, the pilot allowed the airplane to drift to the left edge of the runway and the nose gear of the airplane struck a runway edge marker.
According to the pilot, that impact "forcefully bounced the aircraft back in the air while dragging the tail."
The airplane then "landed hard but controllably" on the left edge of the runway and the pilot steered the airplane back onto the runway.
There was substantial damage to the forward fuselage and nose gear, but no injuries to the pilot.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing and his failure to execute a go- around.
