Defining Event: Hard landing

Flight Conducted Under: Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Non-scheduled
 Analysis The pilot diverted to a nearby airport after he encountered unforecasted freezing rain.
He made two low passes over the airport while trying to clear ice off of the windshield; however, the windshield alcohol de-ice could not keep up with the ice accumulation.
The pilot stated that he had to look out of the side window during the landing and once he descended below the tree line, he was unable to accurately judge his height over the runway.
He stated that this was compounded by the light color of the new concrete runway which had snow blowing across it.
A hard landing resulted after which the pilot taxied the airplane to the ramp.
The right wing sustained substantial damage during the landing.
Contributing to the accident was the unforcasted freezing rain that obscured the windscreen and hindered the pilot's ability to judge the height of the airplane above the runway.
