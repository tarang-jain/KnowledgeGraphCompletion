Location: Skwentna, AK
Accident Number: ANC09CA076
Date & Time: 08/01/2009, 1800 AKD
Registration: N7509K
Aircraft: PIPER PA-18
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Collision during takeoff/land

Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The private pilot reported that he was landing his tailwheel-equipped airplane at his remote, 650-foot-long private airstrip, at the conclusion of a personal cross-country flight operated under Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.
He said that wind conditions required an easterly approach, over an area of stump-covered, down sloping terrain.
During the approach, the airplane™s right main wheel struck a tree stump at the approach end of the site, and the airplane subsequently nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical problems with the airplane.
In his written report to the NTSB, the pilot noted that the accident might have been avoided if he had waited until wind conditions allowed for a different approach, or if he had waited to reduce engine power after clearance with the stump was ensured.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot™s misjudged landing on a downsloping, short landing strip, resulting in a nose over.
