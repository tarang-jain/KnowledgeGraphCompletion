 Analysis The pilot reported that during the takeoff ground roll with a left crosswind condition, the airplane began to swerve immediately after the tail came off the ground and the left wing rose.
The pilot attempted to correct with aileron, rudder, and control stick inputs, but the airplane turned into the wind and the right wing and propeller contacted the ground.
The airplane subsequently came to rest balanced on its right main landing gear, the propeller, and the right wing tip.
The airplane's right wing and right aileron were substantially damaged as a result of impact damage with the runway surface.
The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during takeoff in a crosswind condition.
