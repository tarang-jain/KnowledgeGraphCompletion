 Analysis The pilot was cleared to land on runway 26.
The recorded surface wind at the airport around the time of the accident was from 330 to 340 degrees at 14 to 18 knots, gusting to 25 knots; a peak wind gust from 350 degrees at 26 knots was recorded about 7 minutes after the accident.
The pilot said that he landed on the left main gear with the right main intermittently touching the ground and tried to lower the right wing to improve wheel-to-runway contact but was unsuccessful because of a wind gust.
The airplane swerved off the left side of the runway onto the soft grass area, where the airplaneâ„¢s main landing gear collapsed, and both wings were substantially damaged.
The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operations.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain directional control while landing in gusting crosswind conditions.
