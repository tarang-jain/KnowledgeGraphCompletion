Aircraft: AMERICAN CHAMPION AIRCRAFT

Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Collision during takeoff/land
Injuries: 1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
 Analysis The flight instructor stated that he and the pilot receiving instruction were practicing traffic pattern work and had performed two simulated engine failures without incident before the accident.
The flight instructor initiated a third simulated engine failure at a higher altitude than the previous two and suggested the pilot receiving instruction perform S-turns to lose altitude.
During the maneuver, the airplane descended too low to complete a power-off landing to the runway, and the flight instructor told the pilot receiving instruction to perform a go- around.
The flight instructor also reached for the throttle to add full power for the go-around, but the airplane abruptly pitched down and impacted the ground, substantially damaging the wings and fuselage.
Postaccident examination revealed that the pitch trim control was in the full forward (nose-down) position.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot receiving instructionâ„¢s inadvertent movement of the pitch trim control to the nose- down position while attempting a go-around.
