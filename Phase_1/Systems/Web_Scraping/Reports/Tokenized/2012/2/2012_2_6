 Analysis On February 3, 2012, about 1717 Pacific daylight time, SkyWest Airlines flight 6261, a Bombardier CL600-2B19, N912SW, was impacted by a belt loader at San Francisco International Airport, San Francisco, California, while parked at the gate and ready for pushback.
There were no injuries to the passengers or crew members onboard and the airplane sustained substantial damage.
The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 121 as a scheduled domestic passenger flight to Mahlon Sweet Field Airport, Eugene, Oregon.
After the boarding process was complete, the flight crew was informed that a belt loader had struck the airplane.
According to the operator, the driver of the belt loader that had been parked at the rear cargo door believed there was sufficient room between the loader and the airplane to make a forward right turn instead of backing up.
However, the front left corner of the loader impacted the airplane during the turn and caused substantial damage to the skin, stringers and a frame.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the driver's failure to ensure that the belt loader was clear of the airplane before turning.
