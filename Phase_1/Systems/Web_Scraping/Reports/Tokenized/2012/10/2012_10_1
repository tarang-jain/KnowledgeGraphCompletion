 Analysis The pilot reported that he flew a visual approach and landed near the midpoint of a 2,691-foot- long runway.
The wind was at 5 knots and aligned with the runway, which was dry.
After landing, the pilot applied ﬁlight/normal brakingﬂ but noticed his deceleration rate was inadequate to stop on the remaining runway.
The pilot subsequently applied heavier braking, but the brakes ﬁseemed to have no effect.ﬂ Realizing he was not going to stop the airplane on the remaining runway, the pilot attempted a go-around near the departure end of the runway.
The airplane never became airborne, departed the runway, and impacted an airport perimeter fence.
Substantial damage to the airplane included impact damage to both wings and ailerons.
Skid marks from the accident airplane were documented near the departure end of the runway.
A postaccident examination of the braking system of the airplane revealed no mechanical malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot™s inadequate braking action and decision to abort the landing near the departure end of the runway.
Contributing to the accident was the pilot™s attempt to land near the midpoint of the runway.
