Defining Event: Flight control sys malf/fail

 Analysis The pilot reported that, during the takeoff roll, he was unable to correct an uncommanded left yaw with control inputs, so he elected to abort the takeoff.
During rollout, the airplane departed the left side of the runway and the landing gear collapsed, which resulted in substantial damage to the right wing spar.
A postaccident examination revealed that a "nicopress" fitting on the left rudder cable had failed and disconnected from its bell-crank.
The cable fitting had been pressed with an improper tool or technique at installation.
The airplane's entire flight control system had been refitted and re-rigged approximately 9 years prior to the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The improper installation of the right rudder control cable by maintenance personnel, which resulted in the pilot's inability to maintain directional control during takeoff.
