Date & Time: 08/01/2011, 1545 MDT

Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Loss of control in flight
Injuries: 2 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot reported that prior to takeoff, he noted an approaching storm but estimated that the wind was light and variable for the takeoff roll.
The airplane was slow to accelerate and reached the 50 knot rotation speed halfway down the runway.
The pilot stated that the airplane lifted off and maintained an altitude a few feet above the runway, but lost altitude at the end.
The airplane struck the ground and subsequently nosed over, coming to rest inverted.
A few minutes after the accident, the pilot reported that it began to rain.
The airport density altitude at the time of the accident was calculated to be approximately 9,000 feet, which is 1,000 feet above the manufacturer's recommended maximum takeoff altitude as outlined in the Pilot's Operating Handbook.
The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal flight.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's decision to attempt a takeoff at a density altitude that was outside the performance envelope of the airplane.
Also causal was the flight's likely encounter with a sudden tailwind gust.
