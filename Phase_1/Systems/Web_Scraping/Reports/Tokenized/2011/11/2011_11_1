Accident Number: CEN12CA051
Date & Time: 11/01/2011, 1730 CDT
Registration: N711W
Aircraft: DOWNER BELLANCA 14-19-2
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Loss of engine power (total)

Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot was on a cross-country flight at 9,500 feet mean sea level.
About 20 miles from his destination, he started the descent to the airport.
The pilot reported that he looked at his fuel gauge and decided to switch fuel tanks when the airplane reached 5,000 feet.
As he leveled the airplane, the engine lost power before the pilot switched fuel tanks.
He turned on the fuel pump and attempted to turn the fuel selector knob.
However, the knob broke in half, leaving just the post.
Unable to turn the post and restart the engine, the pilot elected to conduct a forced landing in an open area.
During the forced landing, the left wing was nearly severed in two by impact with a tree, the landing gear collapsed, and the fuselage sustained substantial damage.
After the accident, the pilot stated that he mistakenly turned the fuel gauge selector knob and not the fuel selector knob then got distracted by the knob breaking.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: A total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation as a result of the pilot™s improper fuel management.
Contributing to the accident was the pilot™s diverted attention with the broken fuel gauge knob.
