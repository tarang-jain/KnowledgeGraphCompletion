Location: Carlisle, AR
Accident Number: CEN11CA143
Date & Time: 01/02/2011, 1300 CST
Registration: N876KF
Aircraft: RARDIN WILLIAM I KITFOX III
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Sys/Comp malf/fail (non-power)
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot was landing his single-engine experimental airplane in calm wind conditions, when the left main gear collapsed upon touchdown.
The airplane veered to the right and the pilot attempted to keep the airplane on the runway by applying engine power and right aileron; however, the airplane exited the runway and spun, which resulted in structural damage to the fuselage.
A postaccident examination of the left main landing gear strut revealed that the strut failed due to a pre-existing crack in the weld joint.
The crack would not have been readily visible to the pilot during a pre-flight inspection due to the construction of the strut.
The bracing around the strut exhibited signs of distress with twisted and shiny fracture surfaces.
No other anomalies were found with the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: Failure of the left main landing gear strut due to a pre-existing crack in the weld joint.
