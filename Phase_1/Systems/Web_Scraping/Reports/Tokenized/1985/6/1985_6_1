 Analysis SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF, THE PLT DISCOVERED THAT THE ELEVATOR CONTROLS WERE JAMMED & PITCH CHANGES COULD ONLY BE MADE WITH ELEVATOR TRIM & POWER.
AN EMERG LANDING WAS MADE USING THE TRIM, BUT THE PLT WAS UNABLE TO FLARE THE ACFT AT LANDING SPEED.
THE ACFT STRUCK THE RWY WITH THE NOSE GEAR, BREAKING THE NOSE GEAR OFF.
A POST-ACCIDENT EXAM REVEALED THAT AN AUTOPILOT ADAPTER FLANGE (RECENTLY INSTALLED TO THE BACK OF THE PILOT'S ATTITUDE INDICATOR) WAS IN A POSITION TO CATCH THE ELEVATOR SECONDARY STOP ON THE PILOT'S CONTROL COLUMN.
THE ELEVATOR CONTROL COULD HAVE BEEN FORCIBLY FREED, BUT IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A LARGE FORCE TO DO SO.
