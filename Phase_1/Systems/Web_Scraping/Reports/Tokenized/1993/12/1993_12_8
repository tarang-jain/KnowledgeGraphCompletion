 Analysis THE AIRPLANE EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF ENGINE POWER WHILE ON FINAL APPROACH FOR LANDING.
THE PILOT MADE A FORCED LANDING AND THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER ON LANDING ROLLOUT.
THE PILOT STATED ON BASE LEG THE CARBURETOR HEAT WAS TURNED ON.
THE ENGINE STARTED SPUTTERING ON FINAL APPROACH, POWER WAS INCREASED, AND THE CARBURETOR HEAT WAS TURNED OFF, ON, AND THE ENGINE QUIT.
REVIEW OF THE PROBABILITY ICING CHART REVEALED THE ENGINE WOULD ENCOUNTER SERIOUS ICING AT GLIDE POWER BASED ON THE WEATHER OBSERVATION AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S IMPROPER USE OF CARBURETOR HEAT DURING A VFR APPROACH FOR LANDING.
THIS RESULTED IN A LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DUE TO FUEL SYSTEM CARBURETOR ICING.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF ENGINE POWER Phase of Operation: APPROACH - VFR PATTERN - FINAL APPROACH Findings 1.
(F) WEATHER CONDITION - CARBURETOR ICING CONDITIONS 2.
FUEL SYSTEM,CARBURETOR - ICE 3.
The student pilot made a forced landing, and the airplane nosed over on landing roll.
The airplane sustained substantial damage, and the pilot was not injured.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a VFR flight plan was filed.
The flight originated from Okeechobee, Florida, about 50 minutes before the accident.
The student pilot stated in a telephone conversation with the NTSB investigator-in-charge, that she departed Punta Gorda in the morning at about 0930.
She made three intermediate stops, and refueled at two of the stops before departing Okeechobee, Florida, at 1500 for Punta Gorda.
Upon arrival she entered an extended downwind for runway 09 due to traffic.
The before landing check was completed on base leg and the carburetor heat was turned on.
At about 600 feet agl after turning to final approach, the engine started sputtering.
The power was increased with no noticeable response.
The carburetor heat was turned off and turned back on, and the engine quit.
A distress call was made and a forced landing was initiated.
The airplane touched down on  a road that was perpendicular to the final approach.
When the nose gear touched down, the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted.
Examination of the engine assembly and accessories by the FAA revealed no evidence of a precrash failure or malfunction.
The FAA aviation safety inspector stated in a written statement, "The failure of this engine was due to apparent carburetor icing."
Review of the probability carburetor icing chart revealed that the engine would encounter serious icing at glide power based on the weather observation at the time of the accident.
