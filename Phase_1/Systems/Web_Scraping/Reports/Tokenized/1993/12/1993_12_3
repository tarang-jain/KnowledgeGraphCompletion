Location: PARKIN, AR
Accident Number: FTW94LA042
Date & Time: 12/01/1993, 0901 CST
Registration: N4582
Aircraft: GRUMMAN G-164A
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Ferry
 Analysis THE PILOT OF AN AGRICULTURAL AIRPLANE EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF ENGINE POWER WHILE THE AIRPLANE WAS ON INITIAL TAKEOFF CLIMB.
THE PILOT STATED THAT DUE TO HIS LOW AIRSPEED AND ALTITUDE, HE ELECTED TO LAND STRAIGHT AHEAD IN AN OPEN WHEAT FIELD.
THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER AS THE MAIN LANDING GEAR TIRES DUG INTO THE SOFT GROUND, AND THE AIRPLANE CAME TO REST IN THE INVERTED POSITION.
A DETAILED EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE AND ITS COMPONENTS FAILED TO PRODUCE ANY MECHANICAL PROBLEM THAT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED NORMAL ENGINE OPERATION.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: THE TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS.
A FACTOR WAS THE LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN AVAILABLE TO THE PILOT FOR THE FORCED LANDING.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF ENGINE POWER Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - INITIAL CLIMB Findings 1.
(C) REASON FOR OCCURRENCE UNDETERMINED ---------- Occurrence #2: FORCED LANDING Phase of Operation: DESCENT - EMERGENCY ---------- Occurrence #3: NOSE OVER Phase of Operation: LANDING - FLARE/TOUCHDOWN Findings 2.
TERRAIN CONDITION - SOFT 3.
(F) TERRAIN CONDITION - NONE SUITABLE Factual Information On December 1, 1993, at 0901 central standard time, a Grumman G-164A, N4582, was substantially damaged during a forced landing near Parkin, Arkansas.
The commercial pilot was not injured.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the ferry flight.
According to the operator, the purpose of the flight was to ferry the agricultural airplane to a nearby airstrip to wash and clean the airplane.
The operator was told by the pilot that the loss of power occurred as the airplane was over the departure end of the 1,700 foot airstrip, at approximately 50 to 60 feet above the ground.
The pilot further stated that due to his altitude and airspeed, he elected to land straight ahead in an open wheat field.
The airplane nosed over, coming to rest in the inverted position.
Damage to the airplane included structural damage to the upper airfoil, fracturing of the rudder and vertical stabilizer, and compression damage to the engine cowling.
A detailed examination of the engine by the owner did not reveal any mechanical defects or anomalies that would have prevented normal engine operation.
