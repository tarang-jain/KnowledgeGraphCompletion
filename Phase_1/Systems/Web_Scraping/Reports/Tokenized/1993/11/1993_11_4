Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: A PARTIAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF ENGINE POWER Phase of Operation: GO-AROUND (VFR) Findings 1.
(C) REASON FOR OCCURRENCE UNDETERMINED ---------- Occurrence #2: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH OBJECT Phase of Operation: GO-AROUND (VFR) Factual Information On November 1, 1993, approximately 1225 Pacific standard time (PST), a Cessna 172H, N6629H, impacted trees during an attempted go-around at McKenzie Bridge State Airport, McKenzie Bridge, Oregon.
The private pilot was not injured, but his passenger received minor injuries, and the aircraft sustained substantial damage.
The personal pleasure flight, which departed Hobby Field, Creswell, Oregon, about 30 minutes earlier, was being operated in visual meteorological conditions at the time of the accident.
There was no flight plan filed for this flight, and the ELT, which was activated by the impact, was turned off at the scene.
The pilot said that he accidently came in high to the 2,600 foot long remote airstrip.
Near the approach end of the runway he initiated a go-around, and repositioned the flaps from their full-down position to the 20 degree position.
The pilot said that he applied full throttle, but he felt that the aircraft was not developing full power.
He estimated that the aircraft was only able to gain about 20 feet prior to reaching the departure end of the runway.
The aircraft collided with trees just off the end of the runway, and then impacted the ground.
An FAA Airworthiness Inspector who examined the engine after the accident was unable to find any reason for the reported power loss.
