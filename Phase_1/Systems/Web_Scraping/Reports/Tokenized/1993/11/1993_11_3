Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and an IFR flight plan had been filed and activated.
The airplane was not recovered and is presumed to be destroyed, and the pilot received minor injuries.
The flight originated from Robert Owens International Airport, Grand Cayman, about 1400 the same day.
The pilot stated that while descending to 3,000 feet he added power to level off and the engine began to run rough and eventually quit.
He then declared an emergency and executed a forced landing, ditching to the ocean.
He exited the airplane after touchdown and inflated his PFD and raft.
About 45 minutes later he was rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard.
The airplane was not recovered from the water therefore the airplane and engine could not be examined.
