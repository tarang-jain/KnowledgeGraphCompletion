The private pilot reported no injury.
The airplane was substantially damaged.
Visual meteorological conditions existed at the field.
The ferry flight originated in Lansing, Michigan about 1200 without a flight plan and operated under 14 CFR 91.
The pilot states that prior to entering the traffic pattern to land, he overflew the airport to check the wind sock for wind direction and velocity.
He was not able to receive advisories from the airport unicom.
The pilot approximated the direction of the wind to be from 190 degrees and the velocity 15 to 20 knots.
He elected to land on runway 27.
During the landing roll, the pilot states he experienced a strong gust which exceeded the control authority of the airplane.
The left wing rose, the nose swung left, and the right lower wing tip struck the runway.
The airplane then ground looped onto its back.
The pilot reported 5.8 hours flight experience in this type airplane at the time of the accident.
