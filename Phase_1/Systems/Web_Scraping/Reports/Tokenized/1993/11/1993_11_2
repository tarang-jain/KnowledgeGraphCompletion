Location: WILLIS, VA
Accident Number: BFO94LA001
Date & Time: 11/01/1993, 0849 EST
Registration: N94440
Aircraft: UNIVAIR ERCOUPE 415E
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot reported that while cruising at an altitude of 3,500 feet mean sea level, he attempted to increase power.
He said that at that point, he lost throttle control and the engine went to idle.
The pilot executed a forced landing and collided with the top of automobile in a residential area during the landing.
Because of the mountainous, forested terrain he said he was unable to reach a suitable landing area.
An examination of the airplane revealed the throttle cable assembly fitting failed and separated from its housing which prevented the pilot from manipulating the throttle.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the failure of the airplane's throttle cable fitting due to undetermined reasons, which prevented the pilot from applying power above engine idle.
A factor in this accident was the lack of suitable terrain for the pilot to complete a forced landing without damaging the airplane.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF ENGINE POWER(PARTIAL) - MECH FAILURE/MALF Phase of Operation: CRUISE - NORMAL Findings 1.
(C) THROTTLE/POWER LEVER,LINKAGE - FAILURE,TOTAL 2.
(C) REASON FOR OCCURRENCE UNDETERMINED 3.
(C) THROTTLE/POWER CONTROL - NOT POSSIBLE - PILOT IN COMMAND ---------- Occurrence #2: FORCED LANDING Phase of Operation: DESCENT - EMERGENCY ---------- Occurrence #3: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH OBJECT Phase of Operation: LANDING - FLARE/TOUCHDOWN Findings 4.
(F) TERRAIN CONDITION - NONE SUITABLE 5.
OBJECT - VEHICLE Factual Information On November 1, 1993, about 0849 hours eastern standard time, a Univair Ercoupe 415E, N94440 collided with objects at the termination of a forced landing.
The forced landing was precipitated by a loss of engine power during cruise flight.
The certificated private pilot was not injured and the airplane sustained substantial damage.
The personal flight, being operated by the pilot/owner, originated in Blacksburg, Virginia and was destined for Apalachicola, Florida.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed.
An FAA safety inspector examined the airplane on scene and interviewed the pilot.
The pilot said that when he reduced power, the throttle cable assembly became loose.
He said that he could not regain power and that the power remained at idle.
An examination conducted by the FAA safety inspector revealed a throttle cable assembly fitting separated from its housing which would not allow the pilot to manipulate the throttle.
In his written report, the pilot added that because of mountainous terrain, he was unable to reach suitable terrain to complete the forced landing.
