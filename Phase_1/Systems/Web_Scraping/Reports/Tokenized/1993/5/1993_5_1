Registration: N6332D
Aircraft: CESSNA 172
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 4 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Non-scheduled
 Analysis THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE WAS USING ONLY THE LEFT SIDE OF THE GRAVEL RUNWAY FOR TAKEOFF BECAUSE IT '...WAS IN A LITTLE BETTER CONDITION' THAN THE RIGHT HALF OF THE RUNWAY WHICH WAS VERY WET AND SOFT FROM THE MELTING WINTER SNOW.
DUE TO WET SPOTS ON THE LEFT SIDE, SOME OF THE LEFT EDGE CONE MARKERS HAD BEEN MOVED IN TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE RUNWAY, MAKING THE TAKEOFF AREA EVEN NARROWER.
DURING LIFTOFF THE AIRPLANE WEATHERVANED DUE TO A CROSSWIND, AND THE LEFT HORIZONTAL STABILIZER & ELEVATOR COLLIDED WITH ONE OF THE 3-FT HIGH RUNWAY EDGE RUBBER CONE MARKERS.
THE RUNWAY HAD BEEN REOPENED 4/27 AFTER HAVING BEEN CLOSED FOR 10 DAYS BECAUSE OF THE MELTING SNOW.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: THE PILOT'S POOR JUDGEMENT IN ATTEMPTING A TAKEOFF FROM A NARROW, WET, SOFT GRAVEL RUNWAY WITH A CROSSWIND.
THE RUNWAY CONDITIONS AND THE CROSSWIND WERE FACTORS IN THE ACCIDENT.

(F) AIRPORT FACILITIES,RUNWAY/LANDING AREA CONDITION - WET 2.
(F) AIRPORT FACILITIES,RUNWAY/LANDING AREA CONDITION - SOFT 3.
(F) WEATHER CONDITION - CROSSWIND 4.
(C) JUDGMENT - POOR - PILOT IN COMMAND Factual Information HISTORY OF FLIGHT On May 1, 1993, at 1415 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Cessna 172 airplane, N6332D, operated by RobAir, of Bethel, Alaska, struck a runway edge cone marker during takeoff from the airport at Kasigluk, Alaska.
The commercial pilot and three passengers were not injured, and the airplane was substantially damaged.
The unscheduled domestic passenger flight, operating under 14 CFR Part 135, was destined for Bethel.
Visual meteorological conditions existed, and a VFR flight plan was filed.
During a telephone interview immediately after the accident, the pilot stated the following in part:  "The right half of the runway was very wet and soft from the melting winter snow, so I was taking off using the left side only, which was in a little better condition.
Because of some soft wet spots on the left side, some of the left edge cone markers had been moved in toward the center of the runway, making the takeoff area even narrower.
Just as the airplane was lifting off the runway, it weathervaned to the right because of the right gusty 10 to 15 knot crosswind.
This caused the left horizontal stabilizer and elevator to hit one of the 3 foot high runway edge rubber cone markers.
I looked back and could not see any significant damage to the airplane, and it seemed to fly stable.
Because of the poor condition of the Kasigluk Runway, I decided to continue the flight back to Bethel, which was only about a 13 minute flight.
Other considerations were that Bethel had a better runway, and emergency medical personnel if we should need them."
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Bethel is located 24 miles east of Kasigluk.
At 1353 on the day of the accident the Bethel weather was 5,000 feet scattered, 60 miles visibility, temperature 45 degrees Fahrenheit, dewpoint 38 degrees Fahrenheit, winds 320 degrees at 11 knots, and altimeter setting 29.56 inches of mercury.
After being closed for 10 days because of the melting snow, the Kasigluk runway was reopened on April 27, 1993, as reported by FAA Bethel NOTAM Number 04/017.
Shortly after the accident the pilot reported that the airplane sustained only minor damage to it's left elevator and horizontal stabilizer.
Several days later the damaged components were examined by FAA Inspector Walter G. Zackowitz, FSDO-03, Anchorage, Alaska.
He reported the damage to be substantial by NTSB criteria.
Shortly after the accident the operator ceased operation and surrendered his Part 135 Air Taxi Certificate to the FAA.
