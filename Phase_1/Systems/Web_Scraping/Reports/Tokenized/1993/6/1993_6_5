Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AIRSPEED WHILE MANEUVERING AT LOW ALTITUDE.
A FACTOR WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE ALTITUDE FROM WHICH A RECOVERY WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE.

(C) AIRSPEED - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND(CFI) 2.
STALL/SPIN - INADVERTENT - PILOT IN COMMAND(CFI) ---------- Occurrence #2: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: MANEUVERING Findings 3.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for the local flight.
The airplane was destroyed and the certified flight instructor (CFI), and student were fatally injured.
The flight originated about 1730 from the Tamiami Airport.
According to the owner of the flight school, before the accident airplane crashed, another school airplane had performed a forced landing due to water in the fuel system.
He and two mechanics along with the CFI and student from the forced landing airplane were in the immediate vicinity, when the accident airplane began circling about 500 feet above ground level (agl).
The airplane descended to about 150 feet agl when the nose of the airplane dropped and the airplane descended and impacted the ground.
He further stated that he did not hear any unusual sounds from the engine before the loss of control.
