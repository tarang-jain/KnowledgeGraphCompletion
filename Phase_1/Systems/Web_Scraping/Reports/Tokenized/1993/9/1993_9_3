Registration: N2384D
Aircraft: CESSNA 170B
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis THE PILOT SAID WHILE ATTEMPTING TO TAKEOFF FROM A MOUNTAIN RIDGE, THE LEFT MAIN WHEEL ENTERED A DEPRESSION AND HE HAD TO USE HARDER THAN NORMAL CONTROL FORCES TO KEEP THE AIRPLANE ALIGNED WITH THE TAKEOFF PATH.
WHEN THE AIRPLANE CAME OUT OF THE DEPRESSION, IT BOUNCED INTO THE AIR AND BECAUSE OF THE LEFT QUARTERING HEADWIND, IT CAME BACK DOWN ON THE RIGHT MAIN WHEEL AND THE RIGHT WING.
THE AIRPLANE THEN SPUN AROUND CLOCKWISE ABOUT 180 DEGREES AND HIT ON THE NOSE, THEN THE LEFT WING.
BOTH MAIN LANDING GEAR BOXES WERE TORN OUT OF THE FUSELAGE, WHICH WAS ALSO DAMAGED.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE.
A FACTOR WAS THE  CROSSWIND.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - IN FLIGHT Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF Findings 1.
(C) AIRCRAFT CONTROL - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND 2.
The airline transport pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured, and the airplane was substantially damaged.
The personal flight, operating under 14 CFR Part 91, was destined for another remote landing area located about 1 mile away from the accident site.
Visual meteorological conditions existed, and a VFR flight plan was filed.
When the pilot was contacted by telephone on September 7, 1993, he stated the following, in part:  "During the takeoff roll, the left main wheel got into a depression and I had to use harder than normal control forces to keep the airplane aligned with the takeoff path.
When the airplane came out of the depression, it bounced into the air and because of the left quartering headwind, it came back down on the right main wheel and the right wing.
The airplane then spun around clockwise about 180 degrees and hit on the nose, then the left wing.
Both main landing gear boxes were torn out of the fuselage, which was also damaged."
The pilot's statement on the accident report (NTSB Form 6120.1/2) varies considerably from his telephone statement on September 7, 1993.
