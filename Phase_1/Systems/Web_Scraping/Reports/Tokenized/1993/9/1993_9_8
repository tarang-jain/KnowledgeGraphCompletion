 Analysis THE PILOT AND THREE PASSENGERS WERE ON A LOCAL SIGHTSEEING FLIGHT WHEN ON HIS RETURN TO THE AIRPORT, ONE OF THE PASSENGERS IN THE REAR SEAT BECAME ILL.
THE PILOT STATED THAT HE EXPEDITED THE APPROACH BY REDUCING THE POWER TO IDLE, AND COMMENCING A DESCENT OF ABOUT 1000 FEET PER MINUTE ON THE DOWNWIND LEG.
HE STATED THAT THE AIRPLANE TOUCHED DOWN MIDFIELD AND HE WAS UNABLE TO STOP THE AIRPLANE IN TIME TO AVOID THE EMBANKMENT (BERM) AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY.
THE AIRPLANE STRUCK THE EMBANKMENT AND CAME TO REST ABOUT 60 FEET FROM THE END OF THE RUNWAY.
THE PILOT STATED THAT THERE WAS NO MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: THE PILOT MISJUDGED HIS AIRSPEED AND ALTITUDE WHICH RESULTED IN THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO ATTAIN THE PROPER TOUCHDOWN POINT RESULTNG IN THE AIRPLANE EXITING THE RUNWAY AND COLLIDING WITH THE BERM.
A RELATED FACTOR WAS THE LOCATION OF THE BERM.
Findings Occurrence #1: ON GROUND/WATER ENCOUNTER WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: LANDING Findings 1.
(C) ALTITUDE - MISJUDGED - PILOT IN COMMAND 2.
(C) AIRSPEED - MISJUDGED - PILOT IN COMMAND 3.
(C) PROPER TOUCHDOWN POINT - NOT ATTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND 4.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed.
The certificated commercial pilot and his three passengers were not injured.
The local sightseeing flight was conducted under 14 CFR 91.
According to the pilot, on the downwind leg to runway 25, one of the passengers in the rear seat became ill.
He stated that he expedited the approach by reducing the power to idle, lowering full flaps, and attaining a rate of descent of about 1000 fpm.
He stated that upon flare/touchdown about midfield, the airplane bounced about 3 times.
He reported that when the main wheels were firmly on the runway, he applied the brakes, but the airplane exited the runway and went down an embankment.
The pilot reported that there was no mechanical malfunctions and the accident could have been prevented if he had not expedited the approach which resulted in a higher airspeed and higher rate of descent.
He also stated that a timely balked landing would have prevented the accident.
