The commercial pilot, sole occupant of the airplane, sustained minor injuries.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight.
According to the pilot, nearly an hour after his departure, the airplane was climbing through 5,000 feet, when without warning, the engine loss power.
The pilot stated that he selected a suitable forced landing area as he established the best glide speed and completed the emergency procedures in an attempt to regain power.
The preselected forced landing area was beyond the reach of the airplane, so the pilot elected to land straight ahead in an open field.
After impacting small trees, the airplane impacted in rough and uneven terrain, went through a fence post and a fence, crossed a two lane highway, coming to rest on the shoulder of the highway, with the right wing partially blocking the right lane.
