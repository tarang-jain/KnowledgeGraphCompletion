Location: WASILLA, AK
Accident Number: ANC93FA107
Date & Time: 07/01/1993, 1315 AKD
Registration: N93018
Aircraft: CESSNA 185
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis THE PILOT IN COMMAND SAID THAT HE BELIEVED THAT HE COMMENCED THE WATER TAKEOFF FROM THE GENERAL AREA ON THE LAKE THAT HE NORMALLY DID AND THAT THE TAKEOFF RUN, USING TWO NOTCHES OF FLAP, AND THE LIFT OFF POINT WERE ROUTINE.
NOT ALL OF THE AVAILABLE LAKE AREA WAS USED FOR THE TAKEOFF.
THE PLANE CARRIED APPROXIMATELY 75 GALLONS OF FUEL, THE PILOT AND A PASSENGER, EACH WEIGHING UNDER 175 POUNDS, A FISHING TACKLE BOX AND A SMALL SURVIVAL BAG.
AS THE PLANE CLIMBED TO THE HEIGHT OF THE TREES AT THE RAPIDLY APPROACHING SHORELINE, HE ENCOUNTERED A GUST OF WIND WHICH REQUIRED A MOMENTARY FLIGHT CONTROL INPUT TO COUNTER.
HE DID NOT EXPERIENCE THE SENSATION THAT THE PLANE HAD ENCOUNTERED A DOWNDRAFT.
SHORTLY THEREAFTER, HE REALIZED THAT HE DID NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT ALTITUDE TO CLEAR THE TREES.
THE PILOT'S LOG BOOK SHOWED THAT PRIOR TO JULY 1993, HIS LAST FLIGHT IN N93018 OCCURRED IN JUNE 1992.
THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY DIFFICULTIES WITH THE PLANE'S ENGINE OR FLIGHT CONTROLS.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: THE PILOT IN COMMAND'S FAILURE TO USE ALL OF THE AVAILABLE RUNWAY (WATERWAY).
A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT IN COMMAND'S LACK OF RECENT EXPERIENCE IN THE TYPE OF OPERATION.
Findings Occurrence #1: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH OBJECT Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - INITIAL CLIMB Findings 1.
OBJECT - TREE(S) 2.
(C) ALL AVAILABLE RUNWAY - NOT USED - PILOT IN COMMAND 3.
The airline transport certificated pilot and the one passenger on board received minor injuries, and the airplane sustained substantial damage.
The local pleasure flight was being conducted under 14 CFR Part 91 and a VFR flight plan had not been filed.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The pilot in command told the NTSB investigator during the on scene investigation that prior to commencing the takeoff, he performed a preflight and engine run up check and found everything to be in proper working order.
The airplane's wing fuel tanks were full and the cargo/baggage consisted of a fishing tackle box and a small bag containing survival gear.
The on scene investigation verified this information.
The pilot said that the takeoff was commenced from the other side of the lake in the general area that he normally began his takeoffs from.
Not all of the available lake area was used for the takeoff run.
The plane's takeoff acceleration and engine instrument indications were normal.
The pilot said that he believed that the airplane became airborne in the approximate area that it normally did.
The pilot did not recall the airspeed at which the airplane became airborne nor the speed at which the plane was flown during the initial climb out.
The pilot said that as the airplane climbed to the height of the trees at the rapidly approaching shoreline, a gust of wind from the right was encountered which required some pilot input to correct.
The pilot said that this was the only wind induced event that was experienced during the flight and that he did not experience the sensation that the plane was sinking or that it had entered a downdraft.
The pilot said that upon correcting for the gust, he realized that he did not have sufficient altitude to avoid colliding with the trees.
He then slightly reduced engine power and maneuvered the plane away from a nearby house.
The pilot reported that he did not experience any problems with the plane's engine or flight controls.
The on scene investigation collaborated the comments made by the pilot.
Based upon the empty weight of the airplane, and the known fuel, cargo and weights of the pilot and passenger, the airplane's weight and center of gravity (CG) at the time the takeoff was commenced was approximately 3000 pounds and 42 inches, respectively.
The forward and aft CG limits at 3000 pounds are 40 inches and 46.5 inches, respectively.
The plane's maximum authorized weight is 3350 pounds.
The pilots log book showed that prior to July 1993, his most recent flight in N93018 occurred in June 1992.
