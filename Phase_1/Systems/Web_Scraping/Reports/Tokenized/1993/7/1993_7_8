Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: INDEPENDENCE, OR
Accident Number: SEA93LA146
Date & Time: 07/01/1993, 1755 PDT
Registration: N6LG
Aircraft: DOELLEFELD RV6A
Aircraft Damage: Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis DURING THE TAKEOFF ROLL, THE NEWLY CERTIFIED EXPERIMENTAL RV6A  VEERED SUDDENLY TO THE LEFT AND BEGAN TO DEPART THE SIDE OF THE RUNWAY.
WHILE DEPARTING THE RUNWAY, THE AIRCRAFT LIFTED OFF, BUT ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, THE PILOT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE IN POSITIVE CONTROL.
THE AIRCRAFT THEN CONTINUED TO A POSITION  NEAR THE DOWNWIND, BEFORE ROLLING TO THE LEFT AND DESCENDING INTO THE GROUND AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED.
THE PILOT WAS OBSERVED TO MAKE NO MOVEMENT WHILE THE AIRCRAFT WAS AIRBORNE, AND HE DID NOT RESPOND ON HIS RADIO WHEN ANOTHER PILOT, WHO HAD MADE RADIO CONTACT WITH HIM JUST PRIOR TO THE TAKEOFF, TRANSMITTED A RADIO MESSAGE TO HIM TO SEE IF HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: AN IN FLIGHT LOSS OF CONTOL FOR UNKNOWN REASONS.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - IN FLIGHT Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF Findings 1.
(C) REASON FOR OCCURRENCE UNDETERMINED - UNKNOWN ---------- Occurrence #2: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: DESCENT - UNCONTROLLED Factual Information On July 1, 1993, at approximately 1755 Pacific daylight time(PDT), an experimental Doellefeld RV6A, N6LG, impacted the terrain about one-half mile from Independence Airport, Independence, Oregon.
The FAA certificated private pilot, who was the sole occupant of the aircraft, received fatal injuries, and the aircraft was destroyed.
The personal pleasure flight, which had departed the same location less than one minute earlier, was in visual meteorological conditions at the time of the accident.
The aircraft was not on a filed flight plan, and there was no report of an ELT activation.
According to witnesses and family members, the aircraft, which had been built by the pilot, was on its second flight of the afternoon after receiving its FAA airworthiness inspection earlier that day.
The first flight, which lasted about 25 minutes, was reported to have gone well with no significant problems with performance or controllability.
After the first flight, the pilot removed the cowling, checked the aircraft over for condition, and then rested for a while prior to the next flight.
At the beginning of the second flight, which took place about two hours after the first flight had terminated, the pilot taxied onto the runway, and announced over his radio that he was taking off.
He started his takeoff roll to the north and then, according to witnesses, the aircraft veered suddenly to the left just prior to liftoff.
As the aircraft departed the left side of the runway it became airborne, climbed steeply to about 400 feet above the ground (AGL), and then executed a steep left turn.
The aircraft's left turn brought it to a position near the downwind, where it continued in a southerly direction.
After flying about two-thirds of the length of the runway, the aircraft banked to the left and descended toward the ground with what appeared to witnesses to be an accelerating airspeed.
Just before it impacted the terrain, the aircraft was seen to roll rapidly to near 90 degrees of bank.
According to the FAA, impact scars and wreckage distribution show that it impacted the ground right wing down at a pitch angle of greater than 45 degrees nose down.
The witnesses said that the aircraft then seemed to cartwheel, ending up inverted, and burst into flames as it slid approximately 300 feet through a field off the south end of the airport.
During the time that the aircraft was airborne, the witnesses did not notice any of the precise and distinct flight control movements that had been observed during the earlier flight.
Instead, according to the witnesses, it appeared that the aircraft was not under complete positive control as it climbed, and then descended into the ground.
Witnesses on the ground, and also in a chase aircraft in the air, reported that from the time the aircraft lifted off until it impacted the ground, they saw no movement from the pilot of the RV6.
The pilot of a chase plane, who had radio contact with the RV6A pilot prior to the takeoff, also said that he did not receive any response when he attempted several times to communicate with the RV6A pilot after the aircraft lifted off.
A forensic toxicology examination, which was completed by the FAA Toxicology and Accident Research Laboratory, did not detect any Carboxyhemoglobin, Cyanide or Ethanol in the specimens.
A positive indication of 15.900 (ug/ml, ug/g) Salicylate was detected in the urine.
An inspection of the wreckage by the FAA, with assistance from the designer of the prototype aircraft, did not reveal any pre- impact malfunctions, anomalies or manufacturing defects.
A pair of locking pliers were found in the wreckage of the fuselage, but there was no evidence, either on the pliers or the airframe, which indicated that these had in any way interfered with the control of the aircraft.
