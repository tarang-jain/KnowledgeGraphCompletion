 Analysis AFTER TAKEOFF FOLLOWING THE THIRD TOUCH & GO LANDING ON RWY 36, DURING THE DOWNWIND LEG WHERE THE FLT WAS ABOUT 1 MILE WEST OF THE DEPARTURE RWY, THE STUDENT ADVISED THE CFI THAT HE SMELLED SOMETHING BURNING & THAT THE ENG WASN'T PRODUCING POWER.
THE CFI ADVANCED & RETARDED THE THROTTLE & OBSERVED THAT THE MANIFOLD PRESSURE NEEDLE MOVEMENT FOLLOWED THE THROTTLE MOVEMENT, THEN GAVE CONTROL OF THE ACFT BACK TO THE STUDENT.
THE STUDENT AGAIN STATED THAT THE ENG WASN'T PRODUCING POWER & THE CFI TOOK CONTROL, TURNED TO THE EAST TO LAND ON A TAXIWAY, & LANDED HARD SHORT OF THE TAXIWAY.
FUEL QUANTITY WAS SUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN ENG OPERATION & THE FUEL SUPPLY DID NOT CONTAIN CONTAMINANTS.
THE ENG WAS STARTED AFTER THE ACCIDENT & OPERATED ONLY TO 1,500 RPM DUE TO DAMAGE TO THE PROPELLER ASSY.
