Location: China Lake, CA
Accident Number: LAX06CA050
Date & Time: 12/01/2005, 1720 PST
Registration: N6004X
Aircraft: Mooney M20A
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The airplane made a hard landing on a road after losing engine power.
The flight was the return leg of a long cross-country from Kansas, that included an intermediate refueling stop in New Mexico.
The pilot departed the intermediate airport with 49 gallons of fuel on board and thought he had enough fuel to make it to his destination.
As the flight neared the destination airport the pilot reported to the TRACON controller that he had a low fuel state.
The controller suggested a closer alternate airport.
While attempting to land at the alternate airport, the pilot encountered adverse weather conditions including turbulence and crosswinds that exceeded the capabilities of the airplane.
He decided instead to make a forced landing on a winding and undulating road.
The engine lost power at this point and the pilot switched fuel tanks.
The engine restarted for about 20 seconds and then lost power again.
The pilot was unable to see the rising road in the darkness and did not perform a flare.
The airplane landed hard and came to rest in between the road and a ditch.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: fuel exhaustion due to the pilot's inadequate in-flight planning and fuel consumption calculations.
