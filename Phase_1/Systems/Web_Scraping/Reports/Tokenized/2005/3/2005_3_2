Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: Panama City, FL
Accident Number: ANC05CA040
Date & Time: 03/02/2005, 0645 CST
Registration: N5006V
Aircraft: Air Tractor AT-602
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 137: Agricultural
 Analysis The operator reported that the certificated commercial pilot was departing from a private airstrip in a turbine-powered airplane with 3,500 pounds of fertilizer on board.
The operator noted that the accident flight was the pilot's first flight of the day, and that there was "heavy frost on the aircraft" prior to departure.
During the pilot's takeoff run on the rough and uneven airstrip, the airplane's main wheels struck a bump that bounced the airplane into the air.
Once the airplane was airborne, it rolled left, and the left wing struck the ground.
The operator wrote, in part: "At this point, the aircraft was trying to gain altitude, but stalled and went into the trees under full power..."  The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage.
The operator reported that there were no preaccident mechanical anomalies with the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to remove frost from the airplane which resulted in an inadvertent stall/mush during the takeoff/initial climb, and an in-flight collision with trees.
Contributing to the accident were the rough and uneven airstrip, and degraded aircraft performance due to frost on the wing.
