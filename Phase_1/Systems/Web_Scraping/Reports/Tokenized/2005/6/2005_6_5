Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis Prior to departure, the 5,669-hour commercial pilot checked the flight instruments, magnetos and engine gauges.
All systems were normal.
The pilot then applied full power and proceeded to takeoff.
Shortly after the airplane became airborne, the engine stopped producing power and it descended and struck a fence near the end of the runway.
Examination of the fuel system revealed a blockage between the connector in the fuel tank to the engine driven fuel pump, which resulted in a loss of engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: A blocked fuel line in the fuel tank, which resulted in a loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF ENGINE POWER Phase of Operation: CLIMB Findings 1.
(C) FUEL SYSTEM,LINE - BLOCKED(TOTAL) 2.
(C) FLUID,FUEL - STARVATION ---------- Occurrence #2: FORCED LANDING Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY LANDING AFTER TAKEOFF ---------- Occurrence #3: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH OBJECT Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY LANDING Findings 3.
OBJECT - FENCE Factual Information On June 2, 2005, at 0750 central daylight time, a single-engine Parkwood Enterprises, Inc, Glasair Super II-S experimental airplane, N1UH, was substantially damaged during a forced landing following a loss of engine power during take off from a private airstrip near Los Fresnos, Texas.
The commercial pilot, sole occupant of the airplane, was not injured.
The airplane was registered to, and operated by a private company.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight conducted under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.
In a written statement, the pilot stated that prior to departure, he checked all of the flight instruments, cycled the propeller, checked the magnetos and engine gauges.
All checks were normal.
The pilot then applied full power and proceeded to take-off from Runway 32.
He said that as soon as the airplane became airborne, the engine stopped producing power and it descended and struck a fence before coming to rest in the upright position.
The pilot reported that the wings, undercarriage, and right elevator sustained structural damage.
The landing gear and propeller were also damaged.
The airplane, which had accumulated a total of 552.8 hours since new, was powered by a 180- horsepower Lycoming IO-360 engine.
Examination of the aircraft fuel system by an FAA certificated airframe and powerplant mechanic revealed the fuel injector screen was absent of debris.
When the fuel line between the fuel pump and fuel injection servo was removed, little to no fuel was found in the lines.
There was no fuel in the fuel injector or in the line between the fuel boost pump and the engine driven fuel pump.
In addition, there was no fuel in the hose between the flow divider and the fuel injector servo.
Further examination revealed a blockage between the connector in the fuel tank to the engine driven fuel pump.
The pilot reported a total flight time of 5,669.5 hours, of which, 552.8 hours were in same make and model.
He also reported that at the time of the accident, the winds were calm.
