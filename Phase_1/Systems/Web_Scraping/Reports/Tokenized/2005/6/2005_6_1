Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: Sherman, TX
Accident Number: DFW05CA144
Date & Time: 06/01/2005, 0900 CST
Registration: N62269
Aircraft: Hughes 269A
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
 Analysis A pilot applicant was demonstrating a simulated power failure from a two-foot hover to an FAA inspector when he lost control of the helicopter.
The helicopter drifted aft and to the left before it impacted the ground and rolled on its left side.
The FAA inspector's attempts to recover the helicopter were unsuccessful.
In addition, "A helicopter is susceptible to a lateral rolling tendency, called dynamic rollover, when lifting off of the surface.
For dynamic rollover to occur, some factor has to first cause the helicopter to roll or pivot around a skid, or landing gear wheel, until its critical rollover angle is reached.
Then, beyond this point, main rotor thrust continues the roll and recovery is impossible.
If the critical angle is exceeded, the helicopter rolls on its side regardless of the cyclic corrections made."
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The applicant's failure to maintain directional control of the helicopter during a simulated power failure from a hover and the FAA inspector's delayed remedial action resulted in a dynamic rollover.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF ENGINE POWER(PARTIAL) - NONMECHANICAL Phase of Operation: HOVER - IN GROUND EFFECT Findings 1.
ENGINE SHUTDOWN - SIMULATED ---------- Occurrence #2: LOSS OF CONTROL - IN FLIGHT Phase of Operation: HOVER - OUT OF GROUND EFFECT Findings 2.
(C) DIRECTIONAL CONTROL - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND 3.
(C) REMEDIAL ACTION - DELAYED - FAA INSPECTOR ---------- Occurrence #3: ROLL OVER Phase of Operation: OTHER Findings 4.
