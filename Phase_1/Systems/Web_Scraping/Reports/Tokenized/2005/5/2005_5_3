 Analysis During landing, the pilot lost directional control, ground looped, and nosed over.
The pilot stated that he departed the airport to go to the practice area.
Upon returning to the airport, he used a slipping final for visibility, and to correct for a crosswind.
When the wheels touched down, the airplane began to deviate left of center.
The pilot corrected to the right, the left wing contacted the ground, and the airplane crossed to the right side of runway.
The prop struck the runway and the airplane slowly nosed over.
The pilot then turned off the fuel, master switch, and magnetos.
Both occupants exited from the inverted airplane by sliding the canopy open.
The closest official weather observation station was located 15 nautical miles (nm) northeast of the accident site and was reporting winds variable at 06 knots.
The pilot reported that the winds at the airport were from 280 degrees at 12 knots.
The pilot stated that the airplane and engine had no mechanical failures or malfunctions during the flight.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the pilot's inadequate compensation for the crosswind conditions and failure to maintain directional control, which resulted in a ground loop and nose over.
