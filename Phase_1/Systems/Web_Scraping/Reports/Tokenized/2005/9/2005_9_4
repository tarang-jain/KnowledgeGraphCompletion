 Analysis The airplane experienced a partial loss of engine power and the pilot ditched in the ocean.
While en route over the ocean on a fish-spotting mission, the pilot noticed a decrease in engine power.
The pilot's scan of the cockpit gauges revealed no anomalies, with the exception of a slight rise in oil temperature.
As the pilot maneuvered the airplane toward land, the oil temperature continued to rise and he heard a loud "bang" followed by a vibration.
Engine oil began to cover the windshield and the airplane continued to lose altitude.
With the engine still running, the pilot ditched the airplane in the ocean about 5 miles from the coastline.
The airplane sank to the ocean floor, about 1,200 feet underwater.
