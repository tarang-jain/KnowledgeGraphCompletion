Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis Following a loss of engine power from the right engine during takeoff, the airplane veered to the right of the runway and collided with a hangar.
The pilot reported that he had found a leak in a fuel line fitting on the right engine during the flight prior to the accident.
He fixed the leak by tightening the fitting; however, he had not determined how much fuel remained in the right main fuel tank after the repair or during preflight for the accident flight.
The pilot said the start, taxi, and run-up were normal on both engines.
Just after liftoff, the airplane yawed to the right.
Despite full left rudder and aileron input, the pilot could not prevent the airplane from veering off the runway and colliding with a hangar.
An examination of the airplane after the accident determined that the fuel system for the right wing was still intact, and that there were no leaks.
The right auxiliary fuel tank was still full of fuel.
No fuel was found in the right main fuel tank or in any of the fuel lines leading to the right engine.
Also causal was the pilot's failure to maintain directional control following the loss of engine power.
