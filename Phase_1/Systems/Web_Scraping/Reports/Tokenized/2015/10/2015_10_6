Location: Russian airspace, Japan
Incident Number: ENG16IA001
Date & Time: 10/02/2015, 0510 UTC
Registration: N662US
Aircraft: BOEING 747
Aircraft Damage: Minor
Defining Event: Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries: 367 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 121: Air Carrier - Scheduled
 Analysis The examination of the engine confirmed that there were three holes in the LPT case.
But the holes were under the LPT cooling air manifolds and plenum that did not have any damage.
In addition, there was no damage to the inside of the engine's cowlings nor did any debris fall out when the cowlings were opened.
There was no damage to the LPT cooling air manifolds and plenum that were over the holes and was there was no debris in the cowlings indicating that no debris passed through the LPT case that made this a contained event rather than uncontained.
The disassembly of the engine revealed one 3rd stage turbine vane cluster, No.
29, was missing although the cluster's bolt hole tab with the retaining nut were still in place on the inner transition duct.
The missing cluster's inner shroud was found in the bottom of the engine in the path of the 3rd stage turbine blades.
The metallurgical examination of the inner shroud revealed fatigue, however the full extent of the fatigue could not be determined because the end of the fracture surface was smeared.
The examination of the remainder of the LPT revealed all the other turbine vane clusters were complete and in place or the inner and outer shrouds were in place with just the airfoils missing.
All the LPT blades were fractured and the fracture surfaces were coarse and grainy indicating an overload fracture.
The examination of the remainder of the engine between the fan and high-pressure turbine did not reveal any damage.
The extensive damage to the LPT and the absence of damage throughout the remainder of the engine indicated that the damage to the engine originated within the LPT.
The visual examination and a dimensional inspection of the LPT case revealed the 3rd stage turbine vane hooks had extensive wear that varied significantly between adjacent hooks.
The dimensional inspection revealed the hook for 3rd stage turbine vane cluster No.
29, the missing vane cluster, had the most wear and that wear was tapered.
The tapered wear on the hook and indicates that the vane cluster's outer foot disengaged from the LPT case and tilted rearward.
It was not possible to determine the cause of the tapered wear on the LPT case vane hook that led to the vane cluster disengaging.
The review of the engine's maintenance showed that it had last been overhauled in October 2005 and since accumulated 35,545 hours and 3,532 cycles of service.
Although the engine was overhauled in October 2005, the LPT module's maintenance records show that it had been swapped from another engine and accumulated 17,441 hours and 2,184 cycles since its previous overhaul.
So, at that time of event, the LPT module accumulated 52,986 hours and 6,546 cycles since it had been last overhauled.
Except for the low cycle fatigue life limits for specific rotating parts that are outlined in the engine manual, there is no prohibition for an engine or LPT module to have operated as long as this module had been in service.
The review of the LPT module's maintenance records from the previous overhaul show that the LPT case modification to the anti-rotation slots had been previously complied with.
In addition, the records show that the modification to the 3rd stage turbine vane clusters to remove material from the outer platform gussets had been complied with as well.
Because of previous contained and uncontained PW4000 LPT events, P&W has revised the engine manual to add extensive inspections and repairs to LPT components as well as limiting the number of strip and recoat repairs that can be done to PW4000 LPT airfoils.
The inspections and repairs that were subsequently adopted into an airworthiness directive (AD) included a visual and dimensional inspection of the LPT case's vane hooks.
The tapered wear that was noted on the LPT case's 3rd stage turbine vane hooks occurred over time.
However, the revised inspection and repair procedures that are now mandated by an AD likely would have captured the wear and required it to be repaired or the case replaced.
A vane hook in the LPT case wore to the point to allow a 3rd stage turbine vane cluster to disengage and eventually fall into the path of the 3rd stage turbine blades causing extensive downstream damage to the LPT module.

There was no increase in the N2 rpm or EGT associated with the increase in Wf.
The DFDR contained data from five previous flights.
The data show that No.
3 engine's performance indications were comparable to those of the other three engines.
Fire There was no fire damage.
Tests and Research The engine was removed from the airplane and shipped to Delta's Technical Operations Center, Atlanta, Georgia for disassembly and examination in the presence of the Powerplants Group.
The disassembly revealed one 3rd stage turbine vane cluster, No.
29 that was located at about 8 o'clock, was missing.
(Photo No.
1) A portion of the missing vane cluster's inner shroud was found at the bottom of the engine in the 3rd stage turbine blades' plane of rotation.
(Photo No.
2) The piece of the 3rd stage turbine vane cluster inner shroud had three circumferential grooves that corresponded to the geometry of the 3rd stage turbine rotating inner air seal.

(P&W) Although the vane cluster was missing, the cluster's bolt hole tab with the nut remained in place attached to the inner transition duct.
(Photo No.
3) During the disassembly of the 3rd stage turbine vane area, the torque on the retaining nuts were checked and all including that for the missing vane cluster were found to be tight.
Photo No.

29 3rd stage turbine vane cluster.
(P&W) The remaining 3rd stage turbine vane clusters' were all in place and the airfoils were heavily battered with nicks and dents on the trailing edges.
(Refer to Photo No.
2) The LPT case with the inner transition ducts and all of the 3rd stage turbine vane clusters including the No.
29 vane cluster inner shroud fragment were sent to P&W, East Hartford, Connecticut for metallurgical examination and dimensional inspections that were accomplished under NTSB oversight.
The metallurgical examination of the No.
29 3rd stage turbine vane cluster's inner shroud revealed remnants of fatigue on the counterclockwise side of the forward flange.
The fatigue had progressed forward from multiple origins along the aft surface of the flange to a maximum depth of 0.026 inches.
The fracture surface beyond the fatigue was smeared, so it could not be determined if the fatigue had progressed further.
The examination of the fragment also revealed two wear patterns that were consistent with contact with the No.
28 3rd stage turbine vane cluster in the normal installed position as well as having moved out of position.
The dimensional inspection of the LPT case revealed wear on the 3rd stage turbine vane cluster hooks with the most extensive wear that was also tapered being on the hook for the No.
29 cluster.
The examination of the No.
29 inner transition duct revealed wear patterns from the No.
29 3rd stage turbine vane cluster that were consistent with the cluster having moved inward and aft.
The initial report of this event from NRT was that it was an uncontained LPT event because there were several holes in the LPT case.
The examination of the LPT case confirmed that there were three small holes, largest about 0.69 x 0.44 inches, in the LPT case, all under the LPT case cooling air tubes.
The examination of the cooling air tubes did not show any impact damage and it was reported from NRT that there was no damage to the inside of the No.
3 engine cowling nor did any debris fall out of the cowling when it was opened.
