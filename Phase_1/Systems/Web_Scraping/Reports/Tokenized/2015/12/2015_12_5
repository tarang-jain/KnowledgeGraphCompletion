 Analysis The pilot reported that during the landing roll on a rough grass private strip, the airplane impacted a "little bump" and became airborne.
He reported that he elected to abort the landing due to the end of the runway and trees that were "coming up pretty fast".
The pilot further reported that he knew the airplane would not be able to climb and turn at the same time due to the low airspeed.
He elected to turn right, and subsequently impacted a fence post with the right wing strut.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings, and the fuselage.
According to the pilot there were no pre-impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's decision to continue the unstabilized approach and landing and his delayed decision to go around with an insufficient climb rate, which resulted with collision with trees.
