Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Loss of control in flight
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot reported that during a flight under night instrument flight rules, he exited instrument metrological conditions (IMC) "400 feet high and fast" during the instrument approach.
The pilot continued the landing and reported that he touched down more than half way down the wet runway, and then decided to abort the landing.
Instead of performing the published missed approach procedure, the pilot turned left and entered the traffic pattern.
During the left base, the pilot reported that he reentered IMC, heard the stall warning horn, and felt buffeting.
During the inadvertent aerodynamic stall, the pilot added power but continued the descent to land.
The pilot reported that he regained visual reference to the runway lights on final approach and realized he was too low.
As he attempted to add full power to go-around, the airplane impacted terrain about 1,300 feet west of the runway in a left wing down attitude.
The vertical stabilizer, fuselage, and both wings sustained substantial damage.
The pilot reported there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
