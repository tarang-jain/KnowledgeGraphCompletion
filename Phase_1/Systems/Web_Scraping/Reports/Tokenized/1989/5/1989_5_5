Aviation Incident Final Report
Location: MINNEAPOLIS, MN
Incident Number: CHI89IA083
Date & Time: 05/02/1989, 1440 CDT
Registration: N434AA
Aircraft: MCDONNELL DOUGLAS DC-9-82
Aircraft Damage: Minor
Defining Event:
Injuries: 96 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 121: Air Carrier - Scheduled
 Analysis THE FLIGHT CREW REPORTED THAT WHILE IN CRUISE FLIGHT AT 33,000 FEET, THEY EXPERIENCED A HYDRAULIC SYSTEM FAILURE.
THEY MANUALLY EXTENDED THE LANDING GEAR FOR LANDING AND MADE AN UNEVENTFUL NO FLAPS/NO SLATS LANDING.
POST-ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE LOSS OF HYDRAULIC PRESSURE IN BOTH SYSTEMS WAS DUE TO THE FAILURE OF PTU S/O VALVE BODY ATTACH SCREWS ON THE LEFT SYSTEM VALVE.
THIS ALLOWED THE LEFT VALVE BODY TO SEPERATE FROM THE REMAINING ASSEMBLY, PORTING LEFT SYSTEM HYDRAULIC FLUID OVERBOARD, AND SUBSEQUENTLY DEPRESSURIZING THE RIGHT SYSTEM (ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO LOSS OF RIGHT SYSTEM HYDRAULIC FLUID).
THE MANUFACTURER HAD A RE-DESIGNED, STRONGER UNIT AVAILABLE TO OPERATORS; THIS IMPROVED UNIT HAD STRONGER VALVE BODY ATTACH SCREWS, WELDED VALVE BODIES, STEEL GEARS, AND A SHEAR PIN IN THE MOTOR-TO-VALVE GEAR TRAIN.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be: FAILURE OF THE HYDRAULIC POWER TRANSFER UNIT SHUT-OFF (PTU S/O) VALVE DUE TO FAILED (FATIGUED) VALVE BODY ATTACH SCREWS.
Findings Occurrence #1: AIRFRAME/COMPONENT/SYSTEM FAILURE/MALFUNCTION Phase of Operation: CRUISE - NORMAL Findings 1.
(C) HYDRAULIC SYSTEM,SHUTOFF VALVE - FAILURE,TOTAL 2.
(C) HYDRAULIC SYSTEM - NO PRESSURE ---------- Occurrence #2: ON GROUND/WATER ENCOUNTER WITH TERRAIN/WATER Phase of Operation: LANDING - FLARE/TOUCHDOWN Findings 3.
(C) TERRAIN CONDITION - RUNWAY 4.
