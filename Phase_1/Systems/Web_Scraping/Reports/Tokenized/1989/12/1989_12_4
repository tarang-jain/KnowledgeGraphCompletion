Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The airplane impacted trees and the terrain in a heavily wooded swamp.
The airplane departed on a night cross country flight on December 1, 1989, and failed to arrive at its destination.
At 2312, the pilot contacted a flight service station while en route for the forecast weather along his route.
At 2342, the pilot contacted the Minneapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZMP) and stated that he was "a little disoriented and would like a [transponder] code and a heading toward Sault Ste Marie (ANJ), Michigan."
Two transponder codes were assigned to N2440P, but attempts to establish radar contact were not successful.
The last communication with N2440P was at 2345 when the pilot informed ZMP that their transmissions were "pretty weak."
A witness who reported seeing an airplane flying at tree-top level stated there was heavy snow in the area at the time.
The wreckage was located by hunters on October 12, 2002.
The airplane descended through the trees for approximately 150 feet on a northeasterly heading prior to coming to rest in a nearly inverted attitude.
Flight control continuity was established.
The engine separated from the airframe at the engine mounts.
The engine was buried in the swamp with approximately 1 1/2 inches of one propeller blade being visible.
There were no immediate plans to remove the wreckage from the swamp.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: A collision with trees and the terrain for undetermined reasons.
Findings Occurrence #1: UNDETERMINED Phase of Operation: UNKNOWN Findings 1.
(C) REASON FOR OCCURRENCE UNDETERMINED Factual Information HISTORY OF FLIGHT On December 1, 1989, a Piper PA-22-150, N2440P, operated by an Airline Transport Rated pilot collided with trees and the terrain in a heavily wooded area in Engadine, Michigan.
The pilot was fatally injured and the airplane was substantially damaged.
The 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight was operating in both visual meteorological and instrument meteorological conditions along its proposed route of flight.
No flight plan was filed.
The flight originated from the Cheyboygan County Airport (SLH), Cheboygan, Michigan, en route to the Delta County Airport (ESC) Escanaba, Michigan.
The airplane was reported as missing when the accident happened.
The wreckage was located by hunters on October 12, 2002.
The hunters reported finding the wreckage to the Michigan State Police on October 13, 2002.
According to the pilot's employer, the pilot's duty time on the day of the flight started at 0900 and continued until 1500 when he took a two hour break.
At 1700 he resumed duty and flew a round trip to Erie, Pennsylvania, in a Piper Seneca.
He returned to Cheboygan sometime before 2300.
The employer last talked to the pilot just before 2300.
At that time, the pilot stated that he was going to try to fly to Escanaba and if the weather was bad, he would probably just return to Chippewa, Michigan, and drive to Escanaba in the morning.
At 2312, N2440P contacted the Flight Service Station in Lansing, Michigan, and requested the forecast weather for Marquette, Michigan, and Green Bay, Wisconsin.
An intermittent dialogue concerning the weather and flight conditions along the proposed route continued until 2317.
At 2342, N2440P contacted the Minneapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZMP) and stated that he was "a little disoriented and would like a [transponder] code and a heading toward Sault Ste Marie (ANJ), Michigan."
Two transponder codes were assigned to N2440P, but attempts to establish radar contact were not successful.
The last communication with N2440P was at 2345 when the pilot informed ZMP that their transmissions were "pretty weak."
A witness who was driving west on US 2, approximately 4.5 miles west of Naubinway, Michigan, reported seeing a low flying airplane that matched the description of N2440P around 2330.
She reported the airplane was traveling west at tree-top level.
She stated it was snowing heavily at the time and the wind was blowing off the lake.
Naubinway is approximately 5 miles east of the accident site.
On December 2, 1989, at 0600, the Director of Operations for Midwest Flying Service, received a telephone call from the pilot's wife inquiring as to the whereabouts of her husband.
After the telephone conversation, the director went to the airport and found that the pilot's airplane was not in the hangar.
He then reported the airplane overdue and a search was initiated.
On December 2, 1989, at 1040, the USAF opened a search mission for N2440P.
Elements of the Michigan and Wisconsin Civil Air Patrol, the U.S.Coast Guard, and USAF 305th Air Rescue Squadron participated in the search.
There were 101 sorties flown, totaling 279 hours, in support of the mission.
The search was suspended on December 22, 1989.
