 Analysis THE PILOT TOOK OFF FROM AN AIRPORT WITH A DENSITY ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 9500 FT. AFTER LIFT-OFF, THE AIRCRAFT REACHED AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 100 FT AGL AND THEN STOPPED CLIMBING.
THE PILOT INITIATED EMERGENCY PROCEDURES WHICH INCLUDED LEANING THE MIXTURE AND APPLYING CARBURETOR HEAT MOMENTARILY, BUT THESE DID NOT HELP.
