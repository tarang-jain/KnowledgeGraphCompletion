Aviation Accident Preliminary Report
Location: Fort Lauderdale, FL
Accident Number: ERA17LA026
Date & Time: 10/01/2016, 1808 EDT
Registration: N497SJ
Aircraft: CESSNA 172
Injuries: 2 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On October 1, 2016, about 1808 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 172S, N497SJ, was 
substantially damaged during a precautionary landing at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport 
(FXE), Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The commercial pilot and passenger were not injured. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight 
conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, which departed 
FXE, destined for Punta Gorda Airport (PGD), Punta Gorda, Florida.
According to the pilot, he was planning to fly from FXE to PGD and return. The purpose of the 
flight was to build flight time.
During the preflight inspection, the pilot determined that the engine had 7 quarts of oil, and 
there were no discrepancies with the airplane that would prevent or delay the flight. After 
receiving a clearance to PGD, he taxied out to the run-up area. He went through the checklist, 
which included a complete run-up where the engine rpm drop was within range on both the 
right and left magnetos. The airplane was then cleared to taxi on to Runway 9, and then cleared 
for takeoff.
The pilot applied full throttle and checked that all engine indication instruments were in the 
"green arc," which included the oil temperature and oil pressure. During the initial climb, he 
noticed a more pronounced shimmy from the landing gear than normal. At 2,500 feet mean 
sea level (msl) and 5 nautical miles northwest of FXE, the pilot noticed the oil temperature 
indicated 245 degrees or redline. He then called Miami Approach Control and requested to 
return to FXE. Miami Approach Control asked him if he had an inflight emergency and he 
advised that he had an oil temperature issue. The engine then began running roughly.
The pilot contacted the FXE air traffic control tower, was cleared to land, and advised that the 
winds were 070 degrees at 12 knots, gusting to 18 knots. He then began a turn to the final 
approach leg of the traffic pattern, slowed to flap operating range, and added one notch of 
flaps. The airplane was at 90 knots and slowing, so he did not add a second notch of flaps due 
to the wind gusts. He then reduced engine power to 1,500 rpm and slowed the airplane to 72 
knots.
This is preliminary information, subject to change, and may contain errors. Any errors in this report will be corrected when 
the final report has been completed.
Upon reaching the runway he began to pull back on the control yoke in an attempt to bleed off 
more airspeed to slow the airplane to the 65 knots required for landing. After touchdown, the 
airplane bounced and was substantially damaged before it came to rest on the runway. The 
pilot stated that he did not go-around or abort the landing because of the potential engine 
issue.
Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, revealed 
that the airplane contacted the runway on the nose landing gear, which was bent forward, and 
in contact with the lower engine cowling. Further examination also revealed that the propeller, 
the firewall, the lower forward fuselage skin, and the floorboards were damaged.
According to FAA records, the pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane 
single-engine land, airplane multiengine land, and instrument airplane. He also held a flight 
instructor certificate with a rating for instrument airplane, and a ground instructor certificate 
with an advanced rating. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued on 
June 15, 2016. He reported on that date that he had accrued 702 total hours of flight 
experience.
According to FAA and airplane maintenance records, the airplane was manufactured in 2000. 
The airplane's most recent 100-hour inspection was completed on September 23, 2016. On
