 Analysis The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that as the tail came down during the landing roll in gusty wind conditions, a wind gust lifted the airplane about 10 feet into the air, with the left wing high.
The pilot further reported that the airplane drifted off the runway to the right and impacted the ground right wing first.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, both wings, and the empennage.
According to the pilot there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
A review of recorded data from the automated weather observation station located about 5 miles to the southeast, revealed that, about 7 minutes before the accident occurred, conditions were wind 300 degrees true at 13 knots, wind gust 18 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll in gusty wind conditions, which resulted in runway excursion and impact with terrain.
