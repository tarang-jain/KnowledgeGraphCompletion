 Analysis The pilot reported that, while on a cross-country flight, he diverted from his destination to a nearby airport due to low fuel.
He added that the right fuel tank "went dry" and that the engine lost power on downwind, so he switched to the left fuel tank, and the engine momentarily restarted before it experienced a total power loss of power on base.
Subsequently, the airplane impacted the instrument landing system lights, which resulted in substantial damage to both wings.
The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
He reported that he miscalculated the fuel and "ran out of gas."
A postaccident examination found about 1 cup of fuel in one of the tanks.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's improper preflight planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and the total loss of engine power.
