 Analysis The pilot was landing the helicopter on a nose-up slope when he "noticed the helicopter started to tilt aft."
As the pilot "immediately" increased collective pitch and applied forward cyclic to abort the landing, three of the four main rotor blades struck the wire strike protection system on the cabin roof, which resulted in substantial damage to the blades.
Representatives from the helicopter manufacturer examined the helicopter, replaced the three damaged rotor blades, and then returned the helicopter to service.
According to the pilot, there were no mechanical deficiencies with the helicopter that would have prevented normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's overcontrolling of the helicopter during an aborted slope landing from a hover, which resulted in a main rotor blade strike.
