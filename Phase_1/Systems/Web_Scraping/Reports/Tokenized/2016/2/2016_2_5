 Analysis The owner of the airplane reported that the solo student pilot told him that the airplane "bounced upon touchdown."
He further reported that the solo student pilot executed a "go- around," and "determined the climb out rate was insufficient to clear the trees and the airspeed and altitude were insufficient to permit a safe course adjustment to avoid the tree line."
The airplane touched down on a field with "plowed soft soil," the nose wheel collapsed, and the airplane nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing, the vertical stabilizer, and the rudder.
The owner did not report any preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The student pilot's failure to achieve an adequate climb rate while turning to avoid obstacles during an aborted landing, resulting in an uncontrolled descent, collision with terrain, and a nose over.
