 Analysis While waiting in the run-up area to taxi onto the runway, the pilot of the Cessna heard a loud noise and felt his airplane move.
He shut down the engine and, after getting out of the airplane, he observed that the left wing of a Piper had collided with the left side of the Cessnaâ„¢s rudder and vertical stabilizer, tipping the vertical stabilizer to the right and twisting and buckling the fuselage.
The pilot of the Piper reported that, while he was taxiing to get fuel with no intent for flight, he saw the tail of the Cessna directly in front of him.
He applied right brake action and swiveled his airplane to avoid directly hitting the Cessna with the propeller.
The pilot added that he had no idea why he was unable to see the Cessna in time to avoid the collision.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The failure of the pilot of another airplane, who was taxiing with no intent for flight, to maintain proper visual lookout.
