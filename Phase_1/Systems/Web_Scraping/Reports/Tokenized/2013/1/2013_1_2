Registration: N58677
Aircraft: CESSNA 182P
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Loss of control on ground
Injuries: 2 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
 Analysis After the private pilot and flight instructor conducted a low pass over a snow-covered runway, the private pilot proposed returning to their home airport.
However, the flight instructor elected to demonstrate a soft field touch-and-go landing on the snow-covered runway before the return flight.
When the airplane touched down, the snow was deeper than the flight instructor anticipated, and the airplane slowed faster than he expected.
The pilots added full power and increased back pressure on the control yoke; however, the airplane pitched forward on its nosewheel and then rolled right and left, striking both wings and substantially damaging both main wing spars.
The pilots reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The flight instructorâ„¢s failure to maintain airplane control during a landing on a snow-covered runway.
