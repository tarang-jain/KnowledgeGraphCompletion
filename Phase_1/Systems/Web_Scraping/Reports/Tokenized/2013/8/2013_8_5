 Analysis The pilot of the amphibian airplane reported that she was flying a visual approach to a lake, over mountainous terrain.
On an approximate 3/4 mile final approach to the lake, she observed a boat near her intended landing area and performed a go-around to circle for another approach.
During the go-around and turn, the pilot did not move the throttle lever to full power.
About one-fourth through the turn, she noticed the airplane was descending and increased engine power.
The airplane continued to descend and she increased engine power a second time; however, one of the airplane's floats contacted a tree and the airplane impacted the ground.
The pilot further stated that the accident could have been prevented if she had flown a higher approach and increased the throttle to full engine power immediately during the go-around.
Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed substantial damage to the wings and the fuselage.
The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions with the airplane and the inspector did not observe any.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to set the engine throttle to full power during a go-around.
