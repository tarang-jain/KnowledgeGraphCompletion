Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: Lago Vista, TX
Accident Number: CEN13CA458
Date & Time: 08/03/2013, 1215 CDT
Registration: N6370T
Aircraft: CESSNA R182
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Loss of control in flight
Injuries: 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot stated that she entered the traffic pattern for runway 15, and established a stabilized approach with the airplane configured for landing.
She reported that the airplane touched down in the runway landing zone; however, the airplane bounced and she added engine power in order to stabilize the airplane.
At that time, the airplane encountered a gust of wind which resulted in the left main landing gear departing the runway pavement.
The pilot noted that she added full engine power to initiate a go-around, and the airplane pitched up due to the added power and the pitch trim positioned for landing approach.
She attempted to reduce the flap deflection to 10 degrees; however, the flaps may have been raised completely contributing to an inadvertent aerodynamic stall at a low altitude.
The pilot noted that there were no malfunctions or failures associated with the airplane prior to the accident.
She commented that due to the local terrain it is common to experience some turbulence on approach to runway 15.
She reported that the wind was from 170 degrees at 6 knots, with moderate turbulence.
Wind conditions recorded at local airports were southerly at 10 to 13 knots, with gusts to 17 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilotâ„¢s inadequate recovery from a bounced landing in crosswind conditions, and an inadvertent aerodynamic stall during the subsequent go-around attempt.
