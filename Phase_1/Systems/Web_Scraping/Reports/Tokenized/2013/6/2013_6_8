 Analysis The pilot reported that he had flown into the airport previously, but never in the accident airplane.
While on final approach, he noticed power lines between his position and the runway, and he "pulled back" on the pitch control to overfly the power lines.
The pilot continued the approach and landing, but in the flare, the airplane "dropped and bounced."
When the airplane was airborne after the bounce, he added power to initiate a go-around.
However, the airplane did not climb as expected, and he was experiencing directional control problems.
The pilot reduced power, and landed the airplane in a field adjacent to the runway.
During the rollout in the field, the pilot noticed a ditch ahead of him, perpendicular to his direction of travel, and about 5 to 10 feet wide.
He added power to attempt to fly over the ditch, but the main gear struck the far side of the ditch, which damaged the landing gear and fuselage structure.
The airplane came to rest about two to three airplane lengths beyond the ditch.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the lower fuselage, right wing, and empennage, including the rudder control system.
The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in an abnormal runway contact.
