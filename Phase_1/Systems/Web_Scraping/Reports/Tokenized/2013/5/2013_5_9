 Analysis The flight instructor reported that during an instructional flight, the helicopter was 500 feet above ground level when he rolled the throttle off with the intent for the student to respond by initiating a straight-in autorotation.
The student pilot did not respond properly, so the instructor took the controls to initiate a power recovery.
The helicopter subsequently landed hard, deforming both skids and substantially damaging the airframe.
The pilot did not report any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The student pilotâ„¢s failure to maintain helicopter control during a practice autorotation and the flight instructor's delayed remedial action.
