 Analysis THE PLT REPORTED THAT THE ENGINE LOST PWR ABOUT 20 MILES FROM THE ARPT WHERE HE HAD INTENDED TO REFUEL.
THE AIRPLANE SUBSEQUENTLY COLLIDED WITH UTILITY WIRES AS HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO LAND ON A HWY.
THE PLT ATTRIBUTED THE PWR LOSS TO FUEL EXHAUSTION.
POSTCRASH EXAM OF THE AIRPLANE BY A MECH REVEALED ONLY TRACE AMOUNTS OF FUEL REMAINING ON BOARD.

THE POH NOTES HOWEVER, THAT THERE ARE INDETERMINATE VARIABLES WHICH CAN ACCOUNT FOR VARIATIONS OF 10% OR MORE IN AIRPLANE RANGE & ENDURANCE.
