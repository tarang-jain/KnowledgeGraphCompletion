Aircraft Damage: Substantial

Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis THE AIRPLANE WAS ON A NIGHT CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT WHEN ENGINE OIL STARTED TO APPEAR ON THE WINDOWS.
THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO GET THE AIRPLANE TO AN AIRPORT BEFORE THE OIL PRESSURE WENT TO ZERO.
AFTER LOSS OF OIL PRESSURE, THE ENGINE STARTED TO VIBRATE, AND THE PROPELLER SEPARATED FROM THE ENGINE.
WITH NO FORWARD VISIBILITY AND VERY LITTLE SIDE VISIBILITY, THE PILOT MADE A FORCED LANDING ON A HIGHWAY SERVICE ROAD; HOWEVER, DURING THE LANDING ROLL, THE AIRPLANE IMPACTED HIGHWAY SIGNS AND REFLECTORS.
THE PILOT SAID THERE WAS A FIRE ON THE HIGHWAY, BEHIND THE AIRPLANE, BUT IT NEVER REACHED THE AIRPLANE.
A TEARDOWN OF THE ENGINE REVEALED A FAILURE OF THE CRANKSHAFT THAT WAS INITIATED BY A PRE-EXISTING FATIGUE CRACK.
THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT OPENING OF THE FATIGUE CRACK LED TO GRADUAL LOSS OF LUBRICATING OIL, THEN SEPARATION OF THE PROPELLER.
