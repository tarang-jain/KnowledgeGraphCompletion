Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: FAIRBANKS, AK
Accident Number: ANC00LA023
Date & Time: 02/02/2000, 1500 AST
Registration: N6381V
Aircraft: Stirling AIR CAM
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The commercial pilot was on a local pleasure flight in his experimental airplane.
During the flight the left engine cylinder head temperature began to overheat, and he elected to shut that engine down.
The pilot stated that during landing, the winds were blowing and gusting from the right.
During landing roll, a wind gust lifted the right wing.
The pilot added power to the operating (right) engine, the airplane departed the left side of the snow-covered runway, and struck a snow berm.
The pilot wrote in his NTSB Pilot/Operator report that he could have restarted the left engine for the landing.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's improper compensation for wind conditions during the single-engine landing.
Factors associated with this accident were the pilot's intentional shut down of the left engine, the right crosswind, the icy runway, and the snow berms on the edge of the runway.

(F) AIRPORT FACILITIES,RUNWAY/LANDING AREA CONDITION - BERM Factual Information On February 2, 2000, about 1500 Alaska standard time, an experimental Stirling Air Cam airplane, N6381V, sustained substantial damage during landing on runway 18 at the Chena Marina Airport, Fairbanks, Alaska.
The solo commercial pilot was not injured.
The local personal flight was operated under 14 CFR Part 91, and originated about 1430 from the Chena Marina Airport.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan was filed.
According to an FAA inspector, the pilot stated in an interview on February 3, that during the flight the left engine cylinder head temperature began to overheat, so he elected to shut that engine down.
The pilot told the FAA inspector that during landing, the winds were blowing and gusting from the right.
During landing roll, a wind gust lifted the right wing.
The pilot added power to the operating (right) engine, and the airplane departed the left side of the 4,700 feet long, snow-covered runway, and struck a snow berm.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both landing gear, the landing gear attachment bulkhead, and two leading edge ribs (battons).
The pilot stated in his NTSB Pilot/Operator report that there were high winds above 1,000 feet agl.
He indicated that he intentionally shut down the left engine due to high cylinder head temperature.
He stated that during the landing flare, a wind gust combined with a slick runway pushed the airplane to the left.
He wrote that he added power on the operating (right) engine attempting to straighten the airplane, and struck the berm.
He added in his report that he could have restarted the left engine for the landing.
