Location: CORNELL, WI
Accident Number: CHI00FA129
Date & Time: 05/02/2000, 1050 CDT
Registration: N13145
Aircraft: Cessna 172M
Aircraft Damage: Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries: 3 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The airplane was destroyed by impact with terrain and by fire following a loss of control during climbout.
The pilot and two passengers sustained fatal injuries.
A witness stated, 'I observed him taxi and the next I observed was the takeoff.
I observed some flaps that seemed to be a short field takeoff.
It appeared to not gain the normal altitude.
He seemed to be in a climb attitude (not steep) and the flaps remained on.
My estimate is aprox.
1 mile before he made his left turn.'
He further stated, 'He made the normal pattern for downwind and was still in a climb attitude but not gaining altitude and the flaps appeared to be on.
I observed downwind and he seemed to still not gain altitude and appeared to be about 1 1/2 tree lengths above the trees.
My line of vision was then obscured by a tree and I heard the crash.
I can not remember if the engine was running at the time of impact.
It was through the rest.
(During the initial climb and takeoff [the airplane operator] ran into the Unicom and called for [the pilot] to raise the flaps.
No response.
The flaps I believe never went up.)'
Another witness stated, 'Crashed/looked as if stalled then nose down and left.
Airplane sounded at full power still at or till sound of crash.'
The airplane was found impacting terrain approximately 80 degrees pitch down.
An on-scene investigation revealed flight control and engine continuity and the engine exhibited a thumb compression at all cylinders.
The flap jackscrew was recovered and exhibited 5.9 inches of thread extension which indicated 40 degrees of flap extension.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the pilot not maintaining aircraft control and the stall/spin he encountered.
A factor was the extended flaps.
Findings Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - IN FLIGHT Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - INITIAL CLIMB Findings 1.
(F) FLIGHT CONTROL,FLAP - EXTENDED 2.
(C) AIRCRAFT CONTROL - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND 3.
TERRAIN CONDITION - NONE SUITABLE 4.
The personal flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 91.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.
No flight plan was on file.
The pilot and two passengers sustained fatal injuries.
The local flight was originating at the time of the accident.
A witness stated, "About time of rotation (nose wheel off) noticed flaps out.
[A]mount of deflection unknown.
[L]ooked as if flaps came out/down as climb out proceeded.
Wasn't climbing well/poor rate of climb.
Never got above 200-250 ft. AGL.
Airplane came around toward downwind leg of pattern.
Airplane looked in slow flight attitude.
Sounded as if in full power.
Airplane then went out of sight [and] crashed.
Crashed/looked as if stalled then nose down and left.
Airplane sounded at full power still at or till sound of crash."
Another witness stated, "I observed him taxi and the next I observed was the takeoff.

I can not remember if the engine was running at the time of impact.
It was through the rest.
(During the initial climb and takeoff [the airplane operator] ran into the Unicom and called for [the pilot] to raise the flaps.
No response.
The flaps I believe never went up.)"
Another witness stated, "The plane crossed the highway and then I noticed the wings tipping up and down.
It appeared to barely clear the trees over the wooded area on the south side of highway."
