TERRAIN CONDITION - GROUND Factual Information On May 1, 2000, at 1504 eastern daylight time, a DeHavilland DH-82C Tigermoth, N918DH, collided with the ground following a reported loss of engine power during takeoff at Daytona Beach, Florida.
The airplane was operated by the private pilot under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91, and visual flight rules.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident and no flight plan was filed.
The airplane was substantially damaged.
The pilot and the passenger were not injured.
The accident occurred during the initial departure from Daytona Beach Airport in Daytona Beach, Florida.
The pilot stated that he had made prior arrangements with the tower to receive light gun signals for takeoff from an intersection on runway 7L.
With about 3000 feet of runway remaining of the 10,500 foot runway, the pilot accelerated the airplane for takeoff.
The airplane climbed to an altitude of about 100 feet when a loss of engine power occurred.
The airplane descended and collided with the ground about 150 feet from the end of the runway.
A witness stated that the engine appeared to be running very rough as the airplane accelerated towards the end of the runway.
The airplane had been parked on the ramp and not flown for about one year prior to this flight.
During the post-accident examination of the airplane, it was determined that there was about one half tank of automotive gasoline in the fuel tanks.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration Inspector, the visual examination of the fuel supply revealed that the automotive gasoline appeared to be "stale".
