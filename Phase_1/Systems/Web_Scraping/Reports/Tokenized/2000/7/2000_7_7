OBJECT - FENCE Factual Information On July 1, 2000, at 0845 central daylight time, a Bushby Midget Mustang amateur-built experimental airplane, N6402G, was substantially damaged when it impacted a fence during a precautionary landing at the Richard Lloyd Jones Jr. Airport near Tulsa, Oklahoma.
The aircraft was registered to and operated by the pilot.
The private pilot, who was the sole occupant of the airplane, was not injured.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.
The local flight departed the Richard Lloyd Jones Jr. Airport at an unknown time.
According to the NTSB Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB From 6120.1/2), the pilot was approved by air traffic control for a high speed, low pass over runway 19L.
As the airplane neared the end of the runway, the pilot heard a loud "bang" and felt the airplane vibrate.
He declared an emergency, and executed a precautionary landing to a grass field near the south end of the airport.
During the landing, the left wing contacted a fence, and the airplane spun around 180 degrees collapsing the right main landing gear.
The pilot stated that "inspection showed spinner broke and hit prop - not engine failure."
According to the FAA inspector, who examined the airplane in a hanger, the propeller spinner separated in flight.
Examination of the aircraft revealed that the fuselage was twisted, and the left wing tip fuel tank and left wing tip were separated from the left wing.
