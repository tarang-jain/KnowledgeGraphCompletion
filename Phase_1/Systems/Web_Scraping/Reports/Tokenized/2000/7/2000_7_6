Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot, who is also an aircraft mechanic, had just completed a 100-hour inspection on his airplane, and he inadvertently left the magneto P-leads disconnected.
While in cruise flight, the engine lost power, and the pilot made a successful emergency landing in a field.
The pilot stated that he reconnected the P-leads, checked the magnetos, and attempted a takeoff from the field.
He stated that the acceleration was 'normal;' however, when the airplane lifted off of the ground it 'skipped and settled two or three times.'
The pilot aborted the takeoff 'too late to keep from plowing through some small trees.'
The pilot stated that he misjudged the distance required to takeoff from the soft field.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's inadequate preflight planning and his delay in aborting the takeoff.

The commercial pilot, who was the registered owner of the airplane and the sole occupant, received minor injuries.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.

According to a written statement provided by the pilot, who is also an aircraft mechanic, he had just completed a 100-hour inspection on his airplane and "inadvertently left the magneto 'P' leads disconnected after the mag[neto] check."
The pilot stated that he experienced a loss of engine power while en route to Fort Worth and performed a successful emergency landing in a field.
The pilot stated that he "reconnected the 'P' leads, checked the mag[netos] and attempted a takeoff-estimating that I had plenty of takeoff distance."
He reported that the wind was calm and the fuel tanks were almost full.
He added that the ground was slightly soft.
The pilot stated that the acceleration was "normal;" however, when the airplane lifted off of the ground it "skipped and settled two or three times."
The pilot aborted the takeoff "too late to keep from plowing through some small trees."
The pilot reported that he "misjudged the distance required on the (slightly) soft field."
The FAA inspector stated that the left wing was separated from the airplane and the right wing was structurally damaged.
