OBJECT - TREE(S) Factual Information On June 1, 2000, about 1215 central daylight time, a Piper PA-38-112, N9423T, registered to a private individual impacted with trees after landing at Hopper Field near Steens, Mississippi.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for the 14 CFR Part 91 instructional flight.
The airplane received substantial damage.
The commercial-rated pilot/certified flight instructor (CFI) reported serious injuries.
The student pilot reported no injuries.
The flight departed from Fayette, Alabama, at 1100 en route to Steen, Mississippi.
According to the airport manager, who witnessed the accident, the airplane was high and fast on the approach to runway 36, which was 1,400 feet long.
The witness said the airplane landed about halfway down the runway, departed the end of the runway, and impacted with trees.
The CFI stated, "...student... turned base leg I assisted him to final leg he was fast and high.
I took over the control [and] landed [on the] first 1/3 [of the runway] but I was fast [and] ran out the runway length."
The approach seemed a little high, and a slight wind out of the south could have been a factor.
Our speed on final seemed a little high.
Initial touchdown was about 100-150 feet from the end of the runway...the airplane developed lift and flew another 100 feet before touchdown.
At this point [the CFI] applied the brakes with full pressure, then completely locked a few seconds later.
Speed was still excessive at this point with only 300 feet of runway left...our speed seemed to be about 50-60 mph."
The FAA inspector stated on his report, "...pilot landed long on a short grass field and failed to stop the aircraft before impacting trees."
