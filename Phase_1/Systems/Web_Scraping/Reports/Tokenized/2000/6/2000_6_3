 Analysis The pilot flew the agricultural airplane around the target area (crawfish pond) to be sprayed, 'looking for obstacles and wind direction.'
The pilot made the first spray run from the north to the south, and the second pass from the south to north.
After completing the second run, the pilot passed over power lines and executed a turn to the right and into the direction of the sun.
According to the pilot, the sunlight and glare on the windscreen 'blocked my vision' temporarily.
While still in the turn, the pilot regained 'forward vision' and realized the airplane was flying 'into the power lines.'
After striking the power lines, the airplane came to rest upright in the crawfish pond.
