He reported he "went through the flow checks and restart procedures all the way until impact never admitting to ourselves that the engine was not going to restart."
The pilot stated the pilot-rated passenger had SDA in sight and tried to make an emergency landing at the airport.
The pilot reported they realized they "were not going to make the airport about a quarter mile out and prepared to ditch."
The pilot reported they touched down in a cornfield and subsequently impacted a ditch.
The pilot stated that the nose, nose gear, and right wing were separated from the airplane.
The pilot also stated there was substantial damage to the cockpit, dash and windshield.
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector examined the airplane subsequent to the accident.
The inspector reported the right wing was separated from the aft attach point, but not completely detached from the airplane.
Approximately five gallons of fuel was strained from the left tank.
