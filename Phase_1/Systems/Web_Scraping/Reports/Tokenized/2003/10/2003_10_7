TERRAIN CONDITION - GROUND 3.
The commercial pilot, who was the owner and operator of the airplane, and the passenger sustained serious injuries.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a flight plan was not filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.
The airplane departed the Corpus Christi International Airport (CRP) near Corpus Christi, Texas.
The flight's intended destination was the Gillespie County Airport (T82), near Fredericksburg, Texas.
The 4,000-hour pilot, who was the owner and builder of the airplane, reported to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector that the aircraft was powered by a 300-horsepower Lycoming IO-540 engine, which was driving a 3 bladed composite propeller.
According to information provided by the FAA inspector who responded to the accident site, one of the propeller blades came off while in cruise flight, and the pilot was able to shut the engine down.
Examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector revealed that the shank connecting the composite propeller to the hub was broken, and one of the three blades was missing from the hub.
The pilot/operator failed to provide the Safety Board with a completed Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB 6120.1/2) form.
