 Analysis Upon returning to the airport the pilot requested a traffic advisory and a glider pilot announced he was in the traffic pattern for runway 36.
The pilot announced that he would extend his downwind and base to final to give the glider time to land.
He stated that he went through his pre-landing checklist but elected not to lower the gear at that time, instead he lowered the flaps and proceeded to turn base to final.
He said that he spotted the glider on the ground about one mile out on final and proceeded to land and forgot that he had not lowered his landing gear until he heard the gear warning horn and landed with the gear retracted.
The pilot did not report a mechanical problem with the airplane during the landing.
According to the pilot, he had accumulated over 750 landings in retractable geared airplanes and had never forgot to put the gear down until now.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be: The pilot's failure to follow the pre-landing checklist, and his failure to extend the landing gear which resulted in a wheels up landing.
