 Analysis The airplane sustained substantial damage when it impacted terrain while on approach to land.
The pilot stated that he was a little high on final approach, so he reduced the throttle and lowered the nose.
He reported that when the airplane was 200 to 300 feet from the end of the runway, at a ground speed of 83 knots, the nose of the airplane veered to the left.
The pilot reported he was unable to realign the nose of the airplane using the rudder, and then the left wing stalled.
He reported he was able to get the wings almost level prior to the airplane impacting ground.
The airplane came to rest approximately 50 to 70 feet south of the runway, and 50 to 60 feet prior to the approach end of the runway.
Examination of the airplane showed control surface continuity.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control which resulted in the airplane stalling while on final approach.

The pilot reported that he flew the VOR-A approach, which brought him right over the airport.
He cancelled his IFR flight plan and circled to land on runway 25.
He stated that he had a crosswind from the left, but the winds were light.
The pilot stated that he was a little high on final approach, so he reduced the throttle and lowered the nose.
He reported that when the airplane was 200 to 300 feet from the end of the runway, at a ground speed of 83 knots, the nose of the airplane veered to the left.
The pilot reported he was unable to realign the nose of the airplane using the rudder, and then the left wing stalled.
He reported he was able to get the wings almost level prior to the airplane impacting ground.
The airplane came to rest approximately 50 to 70 feet south of the runway, and 50 to 60 feet prior to the approach end of the runway.
