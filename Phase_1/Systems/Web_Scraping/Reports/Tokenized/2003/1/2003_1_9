According to the pilot this  airplane is "notorious for poor fuel feeding when low on fuel".
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's inadequate in-flight planning/decision by his improper fuel management which resulted in fuel starvation.
Also causal was the pilot's inadequate preflight planning which resulted in his failure to perform fuel consumption calculations and refueling of the aircraft.

(C) PREFLIGHT PLANNING/PREPARATION - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND 2.
(C) FLUID,FUEL - STARVATION 3.
(C) FUEL MANAGEMENT - IMPROPER - PILOT IN COMMAND ---------- Occurrence #2: FORCED LANDING Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY DESCENT/LANDING ---------- Occurrence #3: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH OBJECT Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY LANDING Findings 4.
OBJECT - TREE(S) Factual Information On January 3, 2003, at 1210 eastern standard time a Mielec PZL-M-18, N45051, registered to and operated by Airwork Enterprises of Florida, Inc., collided with trees following a loss of engine power at the Zipper Farms Airstrip in the vicinity of Immokalee, Florida.

As the pilot maneuvered for an emergency landing, the left wingtip struck trees, and the airplane collided with the ground.
The airplane slid backward and, rotated 180 degrees.
According to the pilot, in his preflight planning he did not compute the fuel consumption or reference the pilot operating handbook for the intended flight.
The pilot stated he did not refuel the airplane after the initial load bearing trip.
Initial examination of the accident site revealed the airplane came to rest upright on its gear and slightly tilted to the left.
No fuel was recovered from the right wing tank, 41 gallons of fuel was recovered from the left fuel tank.
The wings and fuselage displayed impact damage.
Examination of the airframe, flight controls, engine assemblies and accessories rervealed no anomalies prior to impact.
The pilot stated that this accident could have been prevented if he refueled the airplane before the initial load.
According to the pilot this  airplane is "notorious for poor fuel feeding when low on fuel".
