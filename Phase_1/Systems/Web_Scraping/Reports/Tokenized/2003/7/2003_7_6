Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 137: Agricultural
 Analysis The pilot stated that during the takeoff roll from the hard-packed rock road used as a runway, the right main landing gear tire blew.
He applied left rudder input and slight left brake, but the airplane veered to the right, off the road onto soft sand/muck, and the airplane then nosed over.
He further reported that the tire blew when the airplane was traveling about 70 mph, which was too slow to fly and too fast to stop before nosing over.
The right main landing gear tire had been replaced in May 2003, and it had accumulated approximately 84 hours in service.
A factor in the accident was the pilot's delay in reducing power immediately after the blown tire.
