 Analysis The pilot reported he was performing a touch-and-go to a hayfield at his brother's ranch.
The pilot said, "After rolling a short distance, I added full power and at the point of takeoff, hit a badger hole which jerked the aircraft."
The pilot said he corrected to the left but was close to a low-lying area filled with willow bushes.
The pilot said he lost airspeed and had the nose of the airplane up.
He said he turned right to keep out of the higher willows.
The pilot said the airplane mushed through the willows and struck the opposite bank of the low-lying area, causing substantial damage to both wings and separating the empennage from the aft fuselage.
An examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the pilot's selection of an unsuitable takeoff area which resulted in an encounter  with the gopher hole during the touch-and-go.
Factors contributing to the accident were the gopher hole, the abrupt pull up, the low airspeed, the inadvertent stall mush, the high vegetation, and the embankment.
