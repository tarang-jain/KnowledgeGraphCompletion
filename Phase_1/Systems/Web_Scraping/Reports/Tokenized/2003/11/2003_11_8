 Analysis The pilot was on final approach, with landing flaps, at a low altitude, transitioning to land when deer ran in front of the airplane.
The pilot reported that he thought the airplane would strike the deer, and abruptly pulled back on the control wheel.
He also added power; however, the pitch up preceded the engine responding.
The pilot said the stall horn sounded momentarily, and then the airplane descended in a nose down attitude and struck the ground, about 150 feet short of the runway and slid for 100 feet.
The nose landing gear collapsed, the lower fuselage was crushed, and the firewall was wrinkled.
A witness reported that the final approach course brought the airplane over a corn field, where deer have been seen before.
The landing distance chart from the Owner's manual revealed the airplane could have crossed the end of the runway at 50 feet, and still stopped within the remaining runway.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's abrupt evasive maneuver to avoid the deer, which resulted in the loss of airspeed and an inadvertent stall.
