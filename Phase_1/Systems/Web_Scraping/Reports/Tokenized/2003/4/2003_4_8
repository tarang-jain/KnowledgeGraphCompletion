 Analysis The pilot said they were capturing bighorn sheep with a net canon.
He said he was pursuing a group of animals up rising terrain (11,200 feet) when his rotor speed began to deteriorate.
He tried to turn the helicopter around, but hit the ground breaking the helicopter's right skid.
Subsequently, the aircraft rolled over onto its right side, and its main rotor blades separated from the helicopter.
The density altitude at the time of the accident was calculated to be 13,068 feet.
