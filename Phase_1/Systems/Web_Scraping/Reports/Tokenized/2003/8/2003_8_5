Location: Oshkosh, WI
Accident Number: CHI03FA239
Date & Time: 08/02/2003, 0920 CDT
Registration: N1068S
Aircraft: Gerlach Skyraider II
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 2 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Business
 Analysis The airplane was substantially damaged when it impacted a road after takeoff.
The pilot reported that the takeoff roll was long and the airplane's engine seemed to lose power.
He stated that he "released [the] flaps to gain speed but the engine seem[ed] to have less power."
The pilot said that after clearing the fence at the end of the runway, he turned right and crashed on the road.
The passenger reported that on the accident flight the pilot used flaps during the takeoff and, in his opinion, the use of the flaps produced enough drag to slow the aircraft's speed on takeoff.
A witness stated that he observed the accident airplane during the takeoff, and the airplane was "going too slow, too low, and was climbing too steeply."
The witness stated that the airplane then stalled and struck the ground.
He stated that the airplane's engine was running until the airplane struck the ground.
In his written report, the pilot listed no mechanical malfunction of the airplane.
A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no pre-impact anomalies.
