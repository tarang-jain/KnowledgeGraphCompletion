Registration: N3418C
Aircraft: Cessna 170
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The private certificated pilot had recently received a tailwheel endorsement, and was practicing landings in the tailwheel-equipped airplane at various airports.
During the accident landing, the pilot reported that a right crosswind was blowing between 10 to 12 knots.
He said the airplane bounced on touchdown, and the right wing was lifted by the wind.
He corrected the bounce by application of rudder, but the left wing contacted the runway surface and the airplane ground looped.
The pilot said a mechanic examined the airplane and advised him that two outboard wing ribs of the left wing and the left aileron required replacement.
Factors contributing to the accident were the presence of the crosswind, and the pilot's lack of experience in tailwheel airplanes.
