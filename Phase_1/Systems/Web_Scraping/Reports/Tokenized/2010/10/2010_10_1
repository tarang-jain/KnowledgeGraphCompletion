 Analysis The pilot reported that he was landing the tailwheel-equipped airplane on a gravel-covered runway in a left crosswind.
He stated that during touchdown he used insufficient rudder and the airplane veered to the left.

The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing assembly and empennage.
The pilot noted that there were no preimpact mechanical anomalies with the airplane.
