 Analysis According to the pilot, he performed a run-up and proceeded to the departure end of the runway.
He applied full power and began the takeoff roll.
With the airplane about halfway down the runway, the pilot realized that the airplane was not developing as much airspeed as he expected.
As the airplane approached the end of the runway, he decided to abort the takeoff.
He pulled back the throttle and applied the brakes but the airplane did not slow down quickly enough.

The pilot noted that he had forgotten to set the flaps properly for takeoff.
During a postaccident examination of the wreckage, a Federal Aviation Administration inspector found no preexisting mechanical anomalies with the airplane.
