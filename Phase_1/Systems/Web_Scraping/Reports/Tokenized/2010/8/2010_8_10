Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: Park Rapids, MN
Accident Number: CEN10CA461
Date & Time: 08/02/2010, 1730 CDT
Registration: N389HW
Aircraft: Wing Kitfox II
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot noted a partial loss of engine power in the float-equipped airplane.
His corrective actions did not restore full engine power and the airplane was unable to maintain altitude.
He reduced engine power to flight idle and entered a rapid descent to a nearby lake.
He noted that the engine continued to operate while in the flight idle position.
Due to the size constraints of the lake, the landing was firm and that the airplane nosed over shortly after touchdown.
The fuselage primary structure, left horizontal stabilizer, right float and support structure, and left wing spar were substantially damaged during the accident.
A postaccident examination confirmed flight control continuity between the cockpit controls and the individual flight control surfaces.
Fuel system continuity was established between the fuel control and carburetor.
The examination did not reveal any evidence of a mechanical malfunction.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: A partial loss of engine power for undetermined reasons and the pilot's failure to adequately flare during the water landing.
