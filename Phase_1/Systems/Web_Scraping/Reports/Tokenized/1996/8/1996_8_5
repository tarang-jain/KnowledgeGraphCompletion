Location: NIKISKI, AK
Accident Number: ANC96LA112
Date & Time: 08/02/1996, 2000 AKD
Registration: N78108
Aircraft: Cessna 172K
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot reported the airplane was approximately 50 to 75 feet above the runway, just entering the landing flare, when the airplane suddenly dropped and landed hard.
The airplane bounced twice, collapsing the nose gear and the left main landing gear, and then nosed over.
The pilot estimated the surface wind as a quartering headwind at 10 to 15 knots.
He believes that he had sufficient airspeed prior to the sudden sinking of the airplane, and thinks he may have encountered windshear.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions.
A factor was the windshear.
Findings Occurrence #1: IN FLIGHT ENCOUNTER WITH WEATHER Phase of Operation: LANDING - FLARE/TOUCHDOWN Findings 1.
(F) WEATHER CONDITION - WINDSHEAR ---------- Occurrence #2: HARD LANDING Phase of Operation: LANDING - FLARE/TOUCHDOWN Findings 2.
(C) COMPENSATION FOR WIND CONDITIONS - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND ---------- Occurrence #3: NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED Phase of Operation: LANDING - FLARE/TOUCHDOWN Findings 3.
LANDING GEAR,NOSE GEAR - OVERLOAD ---------- Occurrence #4: NOSE OVER Phase of Operation: LANDING Factual Information On August 2, 1996, about 2000 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Cessna 172K airplane, N78108, sustained substantial damage while landing at the McGann Industrial airstrip, Nikiski, Alaska.
The solo private pilot was not injured.
The 14 CFR Part 91 flight operated in visual meteorological conditions without a flight plan.
The flight departed Merrill Field, Anchorage, Alaska, about 1900.
During a telephone conversation with the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC) on August 5, the pilot stated he was landing to the west with a quartering headwind estimated at 10 to 15 knots.
He said he had the appropriate airspeed for the landing approach,  but the airplane suddenly dropped 50 to 75 feet and struck the runway.
The airplane bounced, landed again hard, and nosed over.
The pilot suspects that he encountered a windshear while on final approach.
He also stated  he believes that the nosegear collapsed during the first bounce, and on the second touchdown, the left main gear collapsed, which allowed the airplane to nose over.
