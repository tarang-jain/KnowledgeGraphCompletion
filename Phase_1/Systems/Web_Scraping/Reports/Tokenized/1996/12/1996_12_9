 Analysis The pilot obtained a weather forecast in the morning for a flight initiated in the afternoon.
While en route he encountered low clouds short of his destination.
He called the airport of intended landing and found that the existing weather was instrument meteorological conditions.
He descended through a hole in the clouds in an attempt to locate visual instrument conditions, was unable to do so, and made an emergency landing on unsuitable terrain.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the pilot's intentional flight into adverse weather.
Factors were clouds, the pilot's inadequate in-flight planning/decision making, his poor evaluation of the weather, and the encounter with unsuitable terrain for landing.

TERRAIN CONDITION - ROUGH/UNEVEN Factual Information On December 3, 1996, at 1440 central standard time, a Cessna 177, N30255, sustained substantial damage during an emergency landing in a rough farm field, five miles east of Regan, North Dakota.
The pilot told investigators that he was flying VFR on top and decided to descended below the clouds.
When he did so, he was unable to maintain VFR and initiated an emergency landing in a rough farm field.
The non-instrument rated private pilot and one passenger reported no injuries.
The 14 CFR Part 91 flight encountered instrument meteorological conditions at the accident site.
No flight plan was on file.
The flight departed Harvey, North Dakota, about 1400, with the intended destination of Bismarck, North Dakota.
The pilot said that he called for a weather briefing the morning of the accident.
He said the weather was VFR at that time.
He then initiated the flight about 1400, but attained no additional weather information, prior to the flight.
He said that en route to Bismarck he encountered clouds obscuring the terrain and that he was "on top" at 4,000 feet mean sea level.
He said that he called Bismarck, checking for VFR conditions, but found that the airport was reporting instrument meteorological conditions.
He said that he then elected to descend through a hole in the clouds.
He found that visibility and the ceiling prevented him from maintaining VFR and he conducted an emergency landing in a field which he said was approximately 36 miles northeast of Bismarck.
