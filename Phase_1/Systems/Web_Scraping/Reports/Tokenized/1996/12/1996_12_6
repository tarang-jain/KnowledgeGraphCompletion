 Analysis The airplane's engine lost complete power, and the pilot requested radar vectors to the nearest airport.
While on short final, the airplane struck trees, turned 180 opposite the direction of travel, and impacted the ground.
The pilot stated that just after establishing radar contact with ATC, the airplane 'experienced [a] power failure.'
The engine then surged momentarily for about 30 seconds, then stopped.
The pilot did not try to restart the engine again.
He performed a forced landing, but was not able to reach the airport due to head winds.
The airplane had begun a descent from 6,000 feet, shortly before the engine failed.
