 Analysis The student pilot planned to practice takeoffs and landings to build his solo flight time.
He stated that 'The takeoff and pattern work seemed very good.
The final was on track and the glideslope looked correct.
I held about 60 [to] 65 knots over the runway numbers 35.
I became slow and flared too high.
The plane stalled over the runway and came down a little too hard.'
The student also stated, 'I should have did a go-around instead of flaring so high off the ground.'
During touchdown, the nose and left main gear collapsed, and the propeller was damaged.
The student reported that the wind was calm, and there was no mechanical malfunction of the airplane.
