Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The airplane was on a flight from Questa, New Mexico, to Moriarty, New Mexico.
After departing Questa, an intermediate stop was made at Taos Municipal Airport, Taos, New Mexico, for fuel; however, there was no fuel available.
Approximately 24 minutes after departing Taos, while in cruise flight at 9,500 feet MSL, the engine lost power.
A forced landing was made in an open field, and during the landing roll, the airplane 'flipped over the nose.'
A witness reported hearing the airplane's engine 'stop,' and observed the airplane in a 'glide.'
The witness also heard the engine 'start and stop' several times.
An examination of the fuel system revealed that the expansion fuel cap had separated during ground impact, and the only evidence of fuel was a slight odor.
The pilot reported that there was no fuel visible on the clear plastic tube, which served as a fuel quantity gauge at the time the engine lost power.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the pilot's improper planning/decision, which resulted in fuel exhaustion due to an inadequate supply of fuel.
The lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing was a related factor.

A forced landing was initiated to an open field, and during the landing roll, the aircraft "flipped over the nose."
A witness reported in a written statement observing and hearing the following information.
The airplane appeared to be attempting to land at the Santa Fe Airport.
At approximately 1,000 feet AGL the airplane's engine lost total power.
While the airplane was in a "glide," he heard the engine try to restart several times; however, each time it only "sputtered and quit."
An examination of the airplane by the FAA inspector revealed damage to the rudder, the landing gear, both wing tips, and the fuselage.
An examination of the fuel system revealed that the expansion fuel cap had separated during ground impact, and the only evidence of fuel was a slight odor.
The pilot reported to the FAA inspector that there was no fuel visible on the clear plastic tube which serves as a fuel quantity gauge, at the time the engine lost power.
