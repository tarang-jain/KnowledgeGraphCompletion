Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis During landing the pilot experienced a loss of control, and the airplane went off the side of the runway and struck a tree.
According to the pilot, 'I experienced a wind shift, from essentially, up the runway to a direct crosswind to the right.
This wind shift occurred during my landing flare, and blew me off centerline, and toward the right side of the runway.
I immediately took corrective action, but the inertia drove me off the edge of the runway onto the grass along side of (the runway).
I continued to attempt corrective action, but because the trajectory of my travel was about 45 degrees along the runway, but on the grass, control was difficult to return.
The roll started to straighten out gradually, but by this time, I was along the tree line and the right wing tip clipped a small tree, spinning the nose of the plane into the dirt embankment, and trees, bringing the aircraft to a complete stop.'
The pilot reported no mechanical malfunctions.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the pilot's failure to maintain directional control due to improper compensation for wind conditions.

According to the NTSB Form 6120.1/2 the pilot stated that while landing on runway 25, "I experienced a wind shift from, essentially, up the runway to a direct crosswind to the right.
This wind shift occurred during my landing flare, and blew me off centerline and toward the right side of the runway.
I immediately took corrective action, but the inertia drove me off the edge of the runway onto the grass along side of runway 25.
I continued to attempt corrective action, but because the trajectory of my travel was about 45 degrees along the runway, but on the grass, control was difficult to return.
The roll started to straighten out gradually, but by this time, I was along the tree line and the right wing tip clipped a small tree, spinning the nose of the plane into the dirt embankment and trees, bringing the aircraft to a complete stop."
