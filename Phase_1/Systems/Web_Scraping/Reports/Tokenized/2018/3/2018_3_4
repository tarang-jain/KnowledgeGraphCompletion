Defining Event: Loss of control in flight

 Analysis The solo student pilot reported that, during approach, he was above the glideslope after adding full flaps, so he lowered the nose to lose altitude.
He added that he "brought a little more speed than intended" into ground effect and the airplane yawed to the left.
He overcorrected to the right.
The airplane touched down to the right of the runway centerline with the nose pointed 45° to the left.
The student attempted to maintain directional control, but the airplane exited the runway to the right and the right wing struck a runway sign.
The student pilot taxied back onto the runway and to the parking ramp without further incident.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The chief flight instructor of the flight school reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation station located on the airport reported that, about 37 minutes before the accident, the wind was from 360° at 6 knots.
The same automated station reported that, about 23 minutes after the accident, the wind was from 030° at 11 knots, gusting to 17 knots.
The airplane landed on runway 04.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The student pilot's failure to maintain a stabilized approach, which resulted in overcorrection with the rudder during the landing, loss of control, and a runway excursion.
