Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: Santa Paula, CA
Accident Number: GAA18CA120
Date & Time: 02/02/2018, 1115 PST
Registration: N519AC
Aircraft: AMERICAN CHAMPION AIRCRAFT
7GCBC
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Loss of control on ground
Injuries: 2 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot reported that, during landing, she became distracted by another airplane performing a touch-and-go, and upon touchdown, the airplane veered to the right.
She added full power to go around, but the airplane continued to the right as it became airborne, and the right wing struck a parked helicopter.
Subsequently, the airplane impacted the tops of bushes and came to rest inverted in an adjacent riverbed.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Although most loss of control during landing accidents do not result in serious injuries, they typically require extensive airplane repairs and may involve potential damage to nearby objects such as fences, signs, and lighting.
Often, wind plays a role in these accidents.
Landing in a crosswind presents challenges for pilots of all experience levels.
Other wind conditions, such as gusting wind, tailwind, variable wind, or wind shifts, can also interfere with pilots™ abilities to land the airplane and maintain directional control.
What can pilots do?
Evaluate your mental and physical fitness before each flight using the Federal Aviation Administration™s (FAA) ﬁI'M SAFE Checklist."
Being emotionally and physically ready will help you stay alert and potentially avoid common and preventable loss of control during landing accidents.
Check wind conditions and forecasts often.
Take time during every approach briefing to fully understand the wind conditions.
Use simple rules of thumb to help (for example, if the wind direction is 30 degrees off the runway heading, the crosswind component will be half of the total wind velocity).
Know your limitations and those of the airplane you are flying.
Stay current and practice landings on different runways and during various wind conditions.
If possible, practice with a flight instructor on board who can provide useful feedback and techniques for maintaining and improving your landing procedures.
Prepare early to perform a go around if the approach is not stabilized and does not go as planned or if you do not feel comfortable with the landing.
Once you are airborne and stable again, you can decide to attempt to land again, reassess your landing runway, or land at an alternate airport.
Incorporate go-around procedures into your recurrent training.
During landing, stay aligned with the centerline.
Any misalignment reduces the time available to react if an unexpected event such as a wind gust or a tire blowout occurs.
Do not allow the airplane to touch down in a drift or in a crab.
For airplanes with tricycle landing gear, do not allow the nosewheel to touch down first.
Maintain positive control of the airplane throughout the landing and be alert for directional control difficulties immediately upon and after touchdown.
A loss of directional control can lead to a nose-over or ground loop, which can cause the airplane to tip or lean enough for the wing tip to contact the ground.
Stay mentally focused throughout the landing roll and taxi.
During landing, avoid distractions, such as conversations with passengers or setting radio frequencies.
