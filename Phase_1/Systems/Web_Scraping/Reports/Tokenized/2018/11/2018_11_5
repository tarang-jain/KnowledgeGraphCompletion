On November 2, 2018, about 1130 central daylight time, a Bell 47G-3B-1, N1159W, impacted 
terrain after experiencing a total loss of engine power near the Wichita Valley Airport (F14), 
Wichita Falls, Texas. The certified flight instructor (CFI) and airline transport pilot were 
seriously injured and the helicopter exhibited substantial damage throughout. The helicopter 
was registered to Treblig LLC and operated by the pilot as a Title 14 
Code of Federal 
Regulations Part
 91 instructional flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no 
flight plan was filed. The flight originated from F14 at about 1105. 
The pilot reported that they had completed five autorotations with a power recovery while in 
the traffic pattern for runway 31. They positioned the helicopter on a long approach for a 
hydraulics off autorotation. However, when the CFI turned off the hydraulics the engine lost 
complete power. The pilot handed the controls to the flight instructor. Unable to make the 
runway he elected to land in a nearby field. During the approach, the helicopter impacted 
powerlines before it landed hard. The main rotor blade severed the tailboom and the helicopter 
spun before it came to rest on its side. 
The helicopter has been recovered to a secure location for further examination.
