On November 2, 2018, about 1153 mountain daylight time, an amateur-built MUSTANG II 
airplane, N287BM, impacted terrain while on final approach to the Erie Municipal Airport 
(EIK), near Broomfield, Colorado. The private pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The

of Title 14 
Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and 
no Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight plan had been filed for the flight. The airplane 
departed EIK at an unknown time for a local flight. 
Multiple witnesses in the area to the south of EIK reported seeing the accident airplane just 
before the accident. These witnesses reported that the airplane was traveling from west to east 
at a low altitude. The airplane banked "hard" or "steep" to the north and the nose of the 
airplane came down or "dropped". One witness stated that the bank angle was near 90°. 
The airplane impacted a grassy area and trees in a park near Anthem Ranch about 0.4 miles 
south of the approach end of runway 33 at EIK. The main wreckage included the right wing, 
left wing, instrument panel, fuselage, and empennage. The engine separated from the airplane 
and came to rest 18 ft to the north of the main wreckage. The left main landing gear tire 
separated and came to rest 50 yards north of the main wreckage. 
A weather observation at EIK, taken at 1154 recorded wind from 300° at 7 knots. The 
observation taken at 1212 recorded wind from 310° at 10 knots, gusting to 15 knots. A weather

weather observation taken at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport (BJC), Denver, Colorado,
