Aviation Accident Preliminary Report
Location: Anchorage, AK
Accident Number: ANC19LA006
Date & Time: 11/03/2018, 0940 AKD
Registration: N2809L
Aircraft: Cessna 172
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On November 3, 2018, about 0940 Alaska daylight time, a Cessna 172 airplane, N2809L, 
sustained substantial damage during an emergency landing on runway 25 at Merrill Field 
(PAMR), Anchorage, Alaska. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot as a 14 
Code of Federal Regulations
 Part 91 visual flight when the accident occurred. The private pilot 
was uninjured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed for 
the local area flight. The flight departed PAMR about 0935.
According to the pilot, on a previous flight, about 0900 the same day, when around 400 ft 
above ground level (AGL) during climbout, the engine began losing power and ran extremely 
rough. While in the traffic pattern, the engine was only able to produce about 1200 rpm. The 
pilot stated that he was able to return for an uneventful landing on runway 25. 
Following the event, the pilot sumped both fuel tanks and gascolator and found no 
contaminants. He then completed a run-up with no anomalies noted and taxied for departure 
with the carburetor heat on. Upon reaching the run-up area, the pilot completed another run-
up. With no anomalies occurring on either run-up, the pilot elected to depart for a flight 
around the traffic pattern.
Just after departure from runway 25, and around 300 ft AGL, the engine again began losing 
power and ran extremely rough. An emergency was declared and the pilot was able to return 
for landing. During landing, the left wing impacted the runway, resulting in substantial 
damage.
A detailed examination is pending. The airplane was equipped with a Continental Motors O-
300 series engine.
