On April 4, 2018, at 1229 mountain daylight time, a Piper PA-12, N7709H, struck the tail of a 
Diamond Aircraft Inc. DA42 NG, N621ZC, during taxi at Bozeman Yellowstone International

After landing on runway 11, the pilot of the PA-12 was given instructions by the tower 
controller to turn left onto taxiway C2, and then taxi back to the approach end of the runway 
via taxiway C and hold short. While the PA-12 was taxiing, the DA42 landed on the parallel

After reaching the approach end of runway 11, the PA-12 was instructed to cross the runway 
and hold short of runway 12 at taxiway C3. After reaching runway 12 the PA-12 was then 
instructed to cross and contact the ground controller. The PA-12 then crossed runway 12,
