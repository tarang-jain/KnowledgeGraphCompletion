Location: Gambell, AK
Accident Number: ANC19CA002
Date & Time: 10/03/2018, 1500 AKD
Registration: N575Q
Aircraft: Beech 1900
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Abnormal runway contact
Injuries: 9 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Scheduled
According to the flight crew, the instrument approach was flown above the glide slope in 
anticipation of mechanical turbulence. As the airplane descended through 500 ft, the pilot 
monitoring notified the pilot flying, that the airplane was high on the approach. The airplane 
continued the approach above the glide slope and the landing flare was conducted too high, 
which resulted in an excessive sink rate. The pilot flying attempted to arrest the sink rate but 
was unable, and the airplane landed harder than expected, striking the tail, which resulted in 
substantial damage to the lower aft fuselage.
