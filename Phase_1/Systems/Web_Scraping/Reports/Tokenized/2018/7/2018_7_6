Aviation Accident Factual Report
Location: Troy, MI
Accident Number: GAA18CA391
Date & Time: 07/02/2018, 0720 EDT
Registration: N6508K
Aircraft: Cessna 172
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event: Hard landing
Injuries: 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
The solo student pilot reported that during landing, the airplane slowed, and the stall warning 
sounded as the main landing gear contacted the runway. He added that, it appeared that the 
airplane had landed, but he then observed the nose drop below the horizon. He added power to 
go around, but the nose wheel impacted the runway and the airplane pitched "rearward". 
Subsequently, the airplane porpoised, the nose landing gear strut collapsed, and he aborted the 
go around. The student taxied the airplane to park without further incident.
The flight instructor reported that, he witnessed that the airplane on approach was a little flat 
but did not appear to be unstable. The student then pitched the airplane for the numbers, the 
airplane floated down the runway, and touched down in a flat attitude. Subsequently, the 
airplane bounced 2 to 3 ft in the air, porpoised, and the student was then able to taxi from the 
runway. The flight instructor added that, the student was too late on his flare and all of the 
energy came down on the nose wheel. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The student pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions 
with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system at the accident airport reported that, about the 
time of the accident, the wind was from 250° at 7 knots. The student pilot landed on runway 
27.
