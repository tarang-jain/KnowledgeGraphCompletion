 Analysis THE PLT REPORTED THAT A NEIGHBOR HAD FLOWN THE ACFT EARLIER IN THE DAY & HAD PROBLEMS ADJUSTING THE ELEVATOR TRIM WHEN AIRBORNE.
THE PLT STATED THAT BEFORE TAKEOFF, HE CHECKED THE TRIM, BUT IT WORKED NORMALLY, SO HE SET IT FOR CRUISE & MADE A NORMAL TAKEOFF.
WHILE TURNING TO A X-WIND LEG, HE TRIED TO ADJUST THE ELEVATOR TRIM, BUT IT WOULD NOT OPERATE.
THE PLT THEN TRIED TO RELIEVE THE AIRLOAD ON THE STABILIZOR BY PULLING BACK ON THE STICK TO GO INTO A CLIMB, THEN RELEASING THE BACK PRESSURE TO PUT THE ACFT IN A NEAR ZERO 'G' CONDITION.
HE WAS STILL UNABLE TO MOVE THE TRIM.
THE PLT PULLED UP AGAIN, BUT A LITTLE HARDER.
HOWEVER, THIS TIME THE ACFT STALLED & WENT INTO A SPIN.
THE PLT WAS UNABLE TO RECOVER BEFORE THE ACFT HIT THE GROUND.
AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE ELEVATOR TRIM WAS IN A SLIGHT NOSE DOWN POSITION, BUT NO PREIMPACT/MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION WAS DETECTED.
