 Analysis The Beech 58 landed wheels-up on runway 16 at Palwaukee Municipal Airport, Wheeling, Illinois.
In a written statement, the pilot reported, '...Palwaukee gave me a straight in approach for runway 16 and to notify the tower 2 miles out.
I flew to the left to line up with 16 and began a slow decent to traffic pattern altitude.
About 3-1/2 miles out the tower cleared me to land.
I began my pre landing checklist however I became distracted by what I thought was the collision avoidance equipment but in reality was my gear warning horn.
There were a couple of aircraft showing up about a mile and a half away and I was looking for them and never completed the checklist and my normal prelanding GUMPS check.
The aircraft landed gear up in the center of the runway and slid for a short distance.
It stopped half off the left side of runway 16 however no lights were hit.'
