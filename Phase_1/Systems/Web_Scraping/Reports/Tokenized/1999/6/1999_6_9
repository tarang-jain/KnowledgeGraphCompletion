The pilot received minor injuries and the sole passenger was not injured.

The 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions without a flight plan.
The flight was originating when the accident occurred and the intended destination was Bartlesville, Oklahoma.
The pilot stated that he received a weather briefing prior to taking off.
He stated the local winds were gusty and alternating between east and southeast.
The pilot reported that the winds being reported at Wichita, 9 statue miles south of the Maize Airport, were from 150 degrees at 14 knots.
The takeoff was being made on runway 17 (2,000' x 70', grass).
The pilot stated that engine power was 2,100 rpm and oil pressure was normal during the takeoff.
The airplane seemed initially to climb well."
The pilot stated the runway had trees along the left side and he was looking out of the cockpit to assure clearance with them.
The pilot stated that as they reached the south end of the runway, which is lined on both sides by trees, the airplane seemed as though it would not climb.
He stated he looked at the tachometer and the needle was bouncing between 2,100 rpm and 2,200 rpm so he applied full throttle.
The pilot stated he maintained just enough back pressure to keep the airplane airborne.
The pilot stated, "As we approached the area of trees south of the runway and across the highway, the airplane simply had gained no altitude, and was continuing a slight descent."
The right lower wing on the airplane contacted an 8-inch diameter tree about 20 yards south of highway K-96, which borders the south end of the runway.
The airplane rotated to the right and descended to impact with the terrain.
The pilot stated that after the accident, while standing south of the airport, the wind was from the south.
He noticed the wind sock at the north end of the runway at this same time and it was indicating that the wind in that location was out of the northeast.
