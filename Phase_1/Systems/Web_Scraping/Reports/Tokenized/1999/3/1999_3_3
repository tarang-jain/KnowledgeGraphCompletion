Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: DENTON, TX
Accident Number: FTW99LA088
Date & Time: 03/01/1999, 1515 CST
Registration: N92350
Aircraft: Piper J3C-65
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
 Analysis The airplane impacted terrain during a forced landing following a total loss of engine power on takeoff.
The airline transport pilot receiving instruction was on the controls of the airplane for the takeoff.
At an altitude of approximately 100 feet, the engine lost power, and the certified flight instructor took control.
The flight instructor turned the airplane left to avoid a steel rail fence at the end of the runway.
During the turn, the left wing tip struck the ground, and the airplane turned 180 degrees and came to rest.
A mechanic, who examined the airplane, attributed the loss of engine power to a broken throttle control cable clamp.
The broken clamp was made of aluminum; however, a steel clamp was specified by the airframe manufacturer.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The total loss of engine power on takeoff resulting from the failure of an incorrect throttle control cable clamp, which was installed by an unknown person.
A factor was the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.

MANEUVER TO AVOID OBSTRUCTIONS - PERFORMED - PILOT IN COMMAND Factual Information On March 1, 1999, at 1515 central standard time, a Piper J3C-65 airplane, N92350, sustained substantial damage during a forced landing following a loss of engine power on takeoff from Hartlee Field Airport near Denton, Texas.
The airplane was registered to and operated by a private individual.
The flight instructor sustained minor injuries, and the airline transport pilot receiving instruction was not injured.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a flight plan was not filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.
The flight instructor reported that the "check out" flight departed Lakeview Airport, Lake Dallas, Texas, about 1440 and proceeded to Hartlee Field.
Following a full stop landing, with the pilot receiving instruction on the controls, a takeoff was initiated to the north.
According to the flight instructor, "at approximately 100 feet the engine power completely disappeared."
The flight instructor took control and turned the airplane approximately 45 degrees left to avoid a steel rail fence at the end of the runway.
While the airplane was in the turn, the left wing tip struck the ground.
The airplane turned 180 degrees and came to rest heading south approximately 50 feet from the wing touchdown point and 150 feet west of the runway centerline.
An FAA inspector examined the airplane and reported that the left wing, main landing gear, propeller, engine, and firewall were damaged.
A mechanic examined the airplane and found "the throttle control cable housing free, due to a broken attaching clamp."
The mechanic reported that the broken clamp was made of aluminum; however, a steel clamp, Piper P/N 7536, "should have been used."
The mechanic further reported that "the clamp appeared to have been fretting for some time, due to the appearance of the edges, but the main break looked fresh."
He did not think the impact broke the clamp, "because when [he] held the cable assembly in its proper place, it was relaxed, with no strain, even though the airframe was bent in that area."
The mechanic found no other anomalies during his examination of the airplane.
