Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot was attempting a go-around from a private airstrip.
In a written statement, the pilot reported, 'I was coming in for a landing at my son-in-laws private airstrip.
The strip has his house and a power line on the west end and woods on the east end.
His strip is 1,200 feet long, plenty long for a gyro.
I had made several landings there before.
In the past my landings had been to the west.
Due to the wind this one was from the east.
As I approached I realized I was high and would use up a lot of runway, so I decided to go around.
I then eased the throttle on to full and made a right bank .
(there was a street, house, power line and a river to the left).
At that moment the bird went into a downward roll to the left and nothing I did stopped it.
I was on the ground before I knew it'.
The pilot also stated that his airspeed was 40 mph and he did not recall making a right hand climb out before.
The pilot reported that there was no mechanical malfunction.
Examination of the wreckage revealed the gyroplane's rotor blades exhibited a cone shape.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: the inadequate rotor rpm by the pilot.

He stated that he normally turns to the left, but there were houses in that direction, so he turned to the right.
He reported that he could not stop the slow roll to the right and impacted the terrain.
