Aviation Accident Final Report
Location: LA JUNTA, CO
Accident Number: DEN00LA002
Date & Time: 10/01/1999, 2006 MDT
Registration: N6406P
Aircraft: Piper PA-24-250
Aircraft Damage: Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries: 1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under: Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
 Analysis The pilot and pilot-certificated passenger were on a return cross-country flight that originated from Washington, D.C., with a final destination of Lancaster, California.
They departed Missouri earlier in the day, and had planned a stop in Colorado.
While approaching Colorado's La Junta airport for landing, the aircraft encountered wind shifts, downdrafts and turbulent weather conditions.
As the pilot turned onto final approach during one of several unsuccessful landing attempts, the aircraft impacted the ground at an elevation of 4,500 feet msl in dark night conditions.
Probable Cause and Findings The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot-in-command's failure to maintain a proper altitude during final approach to landing, and his misjudgment of altitude clearances.
Factors were the sudden windshift, downdraft and turbulent weather conditions, the dark night, and the pilot's lack of familiarity with the geographic area.

ALTITUDE/CLEARANCE - MISJUDGED - PILOT IN COMMAND Factual Information On October 1, 1999, at 2006 mountain daylight time, a Piper PA-24-250, N6406P, was substantially damaged when it collided with terrain while on final approach to landing at La Junta Municipal Airport, Junta, Colorado.
The private pilot received minor injuries, and the private pilot certificated passenger was seriously injured.
Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal cross-country flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91.
The flight originated from Fredericktown Regional Airport, Fredericktown, Missouri, at 1530 central daylight time.
According to the pilot, prior to departure from Fredericktown, he received an outlook weather briefing from Missouri's Columbia Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) the previous evening, and a standard weather briefing on the morning of the accident.
The pilot stated that the weather "appeared normal with 20 knot headwinds, weather clear."
While en route, he monitored several airport's ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service) reports, and the weather appeared "normal."
In the pilot's accident report, he stated that while en route to La Junta, he noted the aircraft's groundspeed to be 113 knots with a 20 to 30 knot headwind, as indicated on his Global Position System (GPS) receiver.
As he approached La Junta, the wind shifted from a headwind to a tailwind and the GPS indicated the groundspeed to be 165 to 170 knots.
As he approached the airport for landing, the turbulence increased with "wind direction shifts."
As he turned onto final approach, the aircraft encountered a downdraft and began to lose altitude, then impacted the ground.
During the impact sequence, the aircraft sustained damage to both wings, nose gear, and propeller.
Following the accident, the pilot was interviewed by the Otero County Sheriff's Department.
The pilot stated in the interview that he and his father were on a cross-country flight that originated from Washington, D.C., with a final destination of Lancaster, California.
During a stop at La Junta, he initially attempted to land on runway 8, but the "wind was strong and [he] missed the runway."
He aborted the landing and was planning to return for another landing attempt.
He stated that he was "heading east and [was] unfamiliar with the terrain," then struck the ground at an elevation of 4,500 feet msl in dark night conditions.
According to the Sheriff's report, when asked if he had experienced any mechanical problems with the aircraft, he stated, "no, that it was just pilot error."
The passenger was also interviewed while in the hospital.
He stated that "the wind was strong and they misjudged the land around the airport."
