Analysis   
The 7,300-hour captain was unable to maintain directional control of the twin turbojet 
airplane while landing on Runway 04 during day VMC conditions with winds from 130 degrees 
at 17 knots.  The 13,502-feet-long, by 300-feet-wide-grooved runway was reported as dry at the 
time of the mishap.   The airplane struck a runway distance marker, and exited the runway to 
the left during landing roll.  The left wingtip tank fuel load was 200-300 pounds heavier than 
the right wingtip during landing.  Examination of the airplane by maintenance personnel did 
not reveal any discrepancies in the fuel transfer system.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll.  A contributing factor 
was the prevailing crosswind.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
