Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Atkinson, NE
Accident Number:
CHI05CA085
Date & Time:
04/02/2005, 1120 CST 
Registration:
N8150F
Aircraft:
Cirrus Design Corp. SR-22
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Business
Analysis   
The airplane collided with the terrain following a loss of control while landing.  The landing 
was being made on runway 11 (4,040 foot by 50 foot, dry asphalt).  The closest weather 
reporting station, located 20 miles east-southeast of the accident airport, reported the wind as 
being from 170 degrees at 18 knots gusting to 26 knots.  The pilot stated that during the 
lanidng approach, he was able to maintain the runway heading using full left rudder until a 
gust of wind moved the airplane left of the runway centerline.  He stated he applied power, but 
the left wing contacted the sandy terrain about 10 feet off the left side of the runway.  The pilot 
stated the nose of the airplane then contacted the ground and the airplane came to rest 
approximately 300 feet from the initial ground contact.  Post accident inspection revealed the 
initial impact with the terrain was approximately 400 feet from the approach end of runway 
11and 20 feet from the left edge of the runway.  He stated the airplane came to rest 940 feet 
from the approach end of runway 11 and 83 feet from the left edge of the runway.  The 
maximum demonstrated crosswind component for the SR-22 is 20 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to compensate for the wind condition which resulted in a loss of aircraft 
control while landing.  A factor associated with the accident was the gusty crosswind condition 
that existed at the time of the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
