Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Teterboro, NJ
Accident Number:
NYC05CA068
Date & Time:
04/02/2005, 1717 EST 
Registration:
N169TA
Aircraft:
Canadair CL-600-2A12
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
4 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Executive/Corporate
Analysis   
The departure, climb, en route, and descent portions of the flight were conducted without 
incident.  The airplane was vectored onto the final approach course for the ILS 19 approach at 
Teterboro, New Jersey, and the captain configured the airplane to land.  He flew the approach 
at Vref plus 30 knots because of turbulence and reported wind gusts.  As he initiated a flare to 
land on runway 19, the airplane encountered windshear.  It touched down hard on the main 
landing gear, bounced, and then touched down again on the nose wheel.  The captain stabilized 
the airplane, slowed to taxi speed, and exited the runway.  Examination of the airplane 
revealed substantial damage to the pressure bulkhead in the vicinity of the nose gear box.  The 
wind 26 minutes prior to the accident was recorded as 150 degrees at 26 knots, gusting to 37 
knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The captain's improper recovery from a bounced. A factor in the accident was windshear.

Phase of Operation: LANDING - FLARE/TOUCHDOWN

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
