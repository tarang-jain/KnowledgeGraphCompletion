Analysis   
The airplane experienced a partial loss of engine power and the pilot ditched in the ocean.  
While en route over the ocean on a fish-spotting mission, the pilot noticed a decrease in engine 
power.  The pilot's scan of the cockpit gauges revealed no anomalies, with the exception of a 
slight rise in oil temperature.  As the pilot maneuvered the airplane toward land, the oil 
temperature continued to rise and he heard a loud "bang" followed by a vibration.  Engine oil 
began to cover the windshield and the airplane continued to lose altitude.  With the engine still 
running, the pilot ditched the airplane in the ocean about 5 miles from the coastline.  The 
airplane sank to the ocean floor, about 1,200 feet underwater.
Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
