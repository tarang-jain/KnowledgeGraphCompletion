Analysis   
The pilot stated this was his first flight in this specific airplane and after a orientation flight, 
they returned to the Bartow Municipal Airport to land.  Upon making a three point landing,  
the airplane seemed normal, but it then began to swerve to the left.  The pilot corrected with 
rudder, but passed through the center line of the runway.  The airplane then began to bounce 
traveling perpendicular to the centerline.  The right main wheel separated from the spring 
shank and at this point it dug into the runway spinning aircraft to the right.  The plane settled 
down on its belly, right wing low. The pilot-rated passenger stated that the preflight, takeoff, 
taxi, flight, and landing approach were all normal, until touchdown, when the airplane ground-
looped.  During the landing roll an uncontrolled turn to the left commenced,  then it tightened 
up, damaging the landing gear and causing the wing tip to drag, followed by the propeller 
striking the runway.  The aircraft came to rest after spinning 270-degrees, and stopped at the 
edge of the runway. The pilots stated there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions to the 
airplane or any of its systems prior to the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilots failure to maintain directional control resulting in the airplane ground-looping. A 
factor in the accident was the pilots lack of total experience in the airplane make and model.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
