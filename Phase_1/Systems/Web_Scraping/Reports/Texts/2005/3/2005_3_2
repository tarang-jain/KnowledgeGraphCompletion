Location:
Panama City, FL
Accident Number:
ANC05CA040
Date & Time:

Registration:
N5006V
Aircraft:
Air Tractor AT-602
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis   
The operator reported that the certificated commercial pilot was departing from a private 
airstrip in a turbine-powered airplane with 3,500 pounds of fertilizer on board.  The operator 
noted that the accident flight was the pilot's first flight of the day, and that there was "heavy 
frost on the aircraft" prior to departure.  During the pilot's takeoff run on the rough and uneven 
airstrip, the airplane's main wheels struck a bump that bounced the airplane into the air.  Once 
the airplane was airborne, it rolled left, and the left wing struck the ground. The operator 
wrote, in part: "At this point, the aircraft was trying to gain altitude, but stalled and went into 
the trees under full power..."  The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, 
and empennage.  The operator reported that there were no preaccident mechanical anomalies 
with the airplane.                
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to remove frost from the airplane which resulted in an inadvertent 
stall/mush during the takeoff/initial climb, and an in-flight collision with trees.  Contributing 
to the accident were the rough and uneven airstrip, and degraded aircraft performance due to 
frost on the wing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
