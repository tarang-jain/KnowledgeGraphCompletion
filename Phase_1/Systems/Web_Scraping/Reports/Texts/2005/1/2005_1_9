Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Davenport, WA
Accident Number:
SEA05CA035
Date & Time:
01/03/2005, 1245 PST 
Registration:
N310RA
Aircraft:
Cessna 310J
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The flight encountered light mixed icing during descent.  The airplane was in icing conditions 
for about 15 minutes.  The pilot used the de-icing boots during the icing encounter and cycled 
the boots for the last time on downwind leg for landing.  During the landing flare, he reduced 
power over the threshold about 15 feet agl, and the airplane stalled at a higher than normal 
airspeed resulting in a hard landing.  The pilot stated that the accident could have been 
prevented by keeping power and airspeed up until touchdown when landing an airplane which 
has encountered icing conditions and retained some airframe ice.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed during landing with airframe ice, which 
resulted in an inadvertent stall and hard landing.  Factors were the icing conditions and the 
airframe ice.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
