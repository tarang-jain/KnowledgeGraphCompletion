Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The certificated flight instructor (CFI) and student pilot were practicing hovering over a grass 
area.  The CFI reported that the student pilot was flying the helicopter, while he "shadowed" 
the controls and performed corrective inputs.  While hovering, the helicopter's tail rotor 
contacted the ground and the helicopter rolled over onto it's right side.  Examination of the 
helicopter did not reveal any pre-impact malfunctions.   Winds reported at the airport, about 
the time of the accident were variable from 230 to 300 degrees, with the predominate wind 
from 280 degrees at 7 knots, gusting to 20 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's failure to maintain adequate clearance while providing hovering 
instruction, which resulted in tail rotor ground contact.  A factor in this accident was the gusty 
wind conditions.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
