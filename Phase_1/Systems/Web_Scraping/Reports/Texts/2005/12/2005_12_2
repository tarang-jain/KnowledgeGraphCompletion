China Lake, CA
Accident Number:
LAX06CA050

Registration:

Aircraft:
Mooney M20A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The airplane made a hard landing on a road after losing engine power.  The flight was the 
return leg of a long cross-country from Kansas, that included an intermediate refueling stop in 
New Mexico.  The pilot departed the intermediate airport with 49 gallons of fuel on board and 
thought he had enough fuel to make it to his destination.  As the flight neared the destination 
airport the pilot reported to the TRACON controller that he had a low fuel state.  The controller 
suggested a closer alternate airport.  While attempting to land at the alternate airport, the pilot 
encountered adverse weather conditions including turbulence and crosswinds that exceeded 
the capabilities of the airplane.   He decided instead to make a forced landing on a winding and 
undulating road.  The engine lost power at this point and the pilot switched fuel tanks.  The 
engine restarted for about 20 seconds and then lost power again. The pilot was unable to see 
the rising road in the darkness and did not perform a flare.  The airplane landed hard and came 
to rest in between the road and a ditch.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
fuel exhaustion due to the pilot's inadequate in-flight planning and fuel consumption 
calculations.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
