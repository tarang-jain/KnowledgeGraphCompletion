Analysis   
The helicopter impacted a support wire between two poles while it was conducting aerial 
applications.  The pilot completed spraying the field and was getting ready to spray the 
borders.  He checked the power lines near the field and elected to fly beneath them to prevent 
drift over the adjacent field.  As the pilot neared the wires for the spray run, he noticed a guy-
wire running from pole-to-pole below the power lines.  He lowered to collective, but the 
helicopter snagged the wire with the top portion of the vertical stabilizer.  The helicopter then 
impacted terrain and rolled into a canal.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to maintain clearance with the wire during a low altitude aerial application 
flight.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
