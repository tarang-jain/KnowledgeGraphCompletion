Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Kendall, KS
Accident Number:
DEN06LA016
Date & Time:
10/02/2005, 1619 MST 
Registration:
N96YD
Aircraft:
Abruzzo Grom-1
Aircraft Damage:
Minor
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Air Race/Show
Analysis 
The balloon, USA-1, was participating in the Gordon Bennett race. It had been aloft for 22 
hours and had traveled some 350 to 400 miles. Cruising about 35 mph in "smooth air" at 7,000 
feet msl, it encountered "mid-afternoon dry thermals" and a "sudden and unexpected 
downdraft." The dry thermals forced the balloon into an "extreme" and uncontrolled descent. 
The veriometer "pegged" at 1,500 feet per minute descent. The crew attempted to arrest the 
descent rate by throwing ballast overboard, but was unsuccessful and the balloon collided with 
power lines. The entangled gondola severed the power lines and the balloon ascended rapidly. 
As it ascended, the gondola "pitched violently as much as 60 degrees" and the pilot fell out at a 
height approximately 30 to 40 feet. The balloon ascended with the copilot still on board. Using 
a satellite telephone, she notified the chase crew and gave them the location of the accident.  
The balloon ascended to 14,000 feet msl before the copilot was able to "[execute] a controlled 
descent." The balloon hit the ground hard approximately 8 miles from the accident site.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the downdraft forcing the balloon into the power lines. A contrbuting factor was the clear air 
turbulence and the power lines.

Factual Information
On October 2, 2005, at 1619 mountain standard time, an Abruzzo Grom-1 balloon, N96YD, 
registered to Peak Express Balloon, Inc., and piloted by a commercial pilot, sustained minor 
damage when it struck power lines near Kendall, Kansas. Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed at the time of the accident. The personal cross-country flight was being conducted 
under Title 14 CFR Part 91. The pilot was seriously injured. The copilot was not injured. The 
flight originated at Albuquerque, New Mexico, on October 1, 2005, approximately 1846. The 
balloon pilots were participating (and were the defending champions) in the (49th annual) 
2005 Coupe Aeronautique Gordon Bennett International Gas Balloon Race.
The balloon, USA-1, was one of 26 balloons that took off from Albuquerque's Balloon Fiesta 
Park: 14 balloons were in the Gordon Bennett race, 12 balloons were in the America's Challenge 
gas balloon race.  The balloon that traveled the greatest distance was the winner of the race. 
USA-1 had been aloft for 22 hours, and had traversed some 350 to 400 miles when the accident 
occurred.
The pilot stated that the balloon was cruising about 35 mph in "smooth air" at 7,000 feet mean 
sea level (msl) when it encountered "mid-afternoon dry thermals" and a "sudden and 
unexpected downdraft." The dry thermals forced the balloon into an uncontrolled descent. The 
crew attempted to arrest the balloon's descent rate by throwing ballast overboard. The pilot 
said that the uncontrolled descent was "extreme" and that the veriometer was "pegged" at 
1,500 feet per minute descent rate. His attempt to arrest the descent was unsuccessful and the 
balloon collided with the "upper most wire of a set of power lines" along the south side of a 
farm road near Lakin, Kansas. The entangled gondola severed the power lines and the balloon 
ascended rapidly. As the balloon ascended, the gondola "pitched violently as much as 60 
degrees" and the pilot fell out of the gondola. He hit the ground after falling from a height 
approximately 30 to 40 feet.
The balloon ascended with the copilot still on board. Using a satellite telephone, the copilot 
notified the chase crew and gave them the location of the accident.  The balloon ascended to 
14,000 feet msl before she was able to "[execute] a controlled descent." The balloon hit the 
ground hard approximately 8 miles from the accident site, near Lakin, Kansas. About the same 
time, power monitors for the Pioneer Electric Company detected a fault and a crew was 
dispatched. Along with fire and rescue crews, they located the pilot about 300 feet east of the 
intersection of Roads 35 and Y in Hamilton County, near U.S. Highway 50. He had been 
unconscious for about 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was found walking towards a farmhouse.
The pilot said, "Collectively, we have flown dozens of cross-country gas-balloon flights, and the 
sudden onset and severity of this weather phenomenon was unprecedented in our collective 
experience." He suffered a fractured pelvis, displaced ribs, and a shattered forearm and wrist.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
