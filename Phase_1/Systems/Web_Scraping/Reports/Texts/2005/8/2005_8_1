Analysis   
The private pilot reported that while practicing beach landings he made a low, slow pass over a 
beach to check its suitability for landing.  After determining the beach was suitable for landing, 
he made a left turn to the beach for landing.  He added flaps in the turn, and as he turned final, 
he realized he was too low and too slow.  He added power, but the airplane impacted terrain 
short of the intended landing area.  The landing gear collapsed, and the wings and fuselage 
impacted the ground.  The pilot stated there were no known mechanical anomalies with the 
airplane prior to the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's misjudged distance/altitude during final approach, which resulted in an undershoot

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
