Location:
BUNNELL, FL
Accident Number:
ATL96LA075
Date & Time:
04/02/1996, 1550 EST 
Registration:
N7355S
Aircraft:
Cessna 182P
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The flight was returning to the departure airport when the airplane experienced a loss of 
engine power . According to the pilot, he attempted to restart the engine several times, but was 
unable to. The pilot reported that the carburetor heat was applied during the restart attempts, 
but there was no report by the pilot of the application of carburetor heat prior to the loss of 
engine power.  The airplane collided with trees one mile east of the airport. The examination of 
the engine assembly, after the accident, failed to disclose a mechanical problem. A review of 
weather data at the approximate time of the accident disclosed that conditions were favorable 
for the formation of carburetor icing. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to obtain a preflight weather briefing and his failure to apply carburetor heat 
that resulted in a loss of engine power. A factor was weather conditions were favorable for the 
formation of carburetor icing at cruise flight.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
