Factual Information
 On March 1, 1996, at 1800 central standard time, a Piper PA-28-140, N95394, registered to an

The pilot and one passenger reported no injuries.  The local flight was operating in visual 
meteorological conditions.  No flight plan was on file.  The flight was on departure at the time 
of the accident.
The pilot stated that both she and her passenger experienced periods of incapacitation during 
the accident sequence.  Although neither occupant of the airplane sustained any injuries due to 
the impact both were hospitalized for observation and testing for carbon monoxide.  The tests 
were positive and the results are attached to this report.
Subsequent to the accident an examination of the exhaust system of the accident airplane was

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
