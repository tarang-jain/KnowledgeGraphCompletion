Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
BARTLESVILLE, OK
Accident Number:
FTW96FA234B
Date & Time:
06/01/1996, 1412 CDT 
Registration:
N12428
Aircraft:
Waco QCF
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
Both the Fairchild KR-31, N7780, and the Waco QCF, N12428, were occupied by a PIC and a 
pilot-rated passenger. Witnesses observed both biplanes collide at the downwind/base position 
and descend uncontrolled to the ground. Left wing portions from each biplane were found at 
the initial impact site. The lower left wing outboard section of the Waco was found between the 
left wings of the Fairchild. The Fairchild did not have an electrical system. The Waco was 
equipped with navigation lights and an electrical system; however, the type and status of 
avionics equipment could not be determined due to the postimpact fire damage. A light gun 
was available in the temporary control tower; however, it was not being used at the time of the 
collision, and neither biplane was in communication with the tower in Class D airspace. An 
ATC letter to the airport indicated that ATC would separate arriving and departing traffic, with 
ground movement by airport management, operators and pilots, with safety items/factors 
brought to the attention of ATC prior to the operation of the tower. The biplane association and 
the airport representatives stated that the tower was a 'control tower' and applicable control 
airspace procedures were expected by ATC and the pilots. Neither the NBA nor the airport had 
established rigid communication, routing and altitude procedures for the fly-by period, and 
pilot briefings were not conducted. In tension with the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, the 
Federal Aviation Administration did not offer and/or provide the NBA and airport authorities 
with clearly delineated insight and guidance that fostered the safest use of the airspace during 
the fly-in. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of each pilot-in-command to maintain visual lookout. Factors were: the lack of each 
pilot-in-command obtaining/maintaining communication with the control tower, and 
inadequate lookout by each pilot-rated passenger, the inadequate procedures/directives by the 
biplane association management and the airport management, and inadequate supervision by 
the Federal Aviation Administration.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
