Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
During a dual instructional lesson, the CFI initiated a practice autorotation from 1,000 feet 
above ground level (agl) while in the traffic pattern.  The CFI reported that as the helicopter 
descended through 800 feet agl, all engine power was suddenly lost and the practice maneuver 
turned into a forced landing.  Just prior to experiencing the engine power loss, all instruments 
had been in the green.  The CFI further stated that the helicopter touched down softly at the 
approach end of the runway with a forward speed between 2 and 3 miles per hour.  Thereafter, 
the helicopter tipped forward, shook violently, and the main rotor blade contacted the airframe 
which resulted in substantial damage. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
loss of engine power for undetermined reason(s), while practicing an autorotation, which 
resulted in a forced landing; and the flight instructor's misjudged landing flare during the 
emergency autorotation/landing.

Factual Information
 On June 1, 1996, at 0948 hours Pacific daylight time, the pilot of a Hughes 269B, N9332F, 
initiated a practice autorotation from 1,000 feet above ground level (agl) while in the traffic 
pattern at the Georgetown Airport, Georgetown, California.  At the time, the certified flight 
instructor (CFI) was providing dual instruction to his student.  The aircraft was substantially 
damaged and there were no injuries.  The flight originated at 0920 from private property in 
Foresthill, California.
The CFI reported that as the helicopter descended through 800 feet agl, all engine power was 
suddenly lost and the practice maneuver turned into a forced landing.  Just prior to 
experiencing the engine power loss, all instruments had been "in the green."  The CFI further 
stated that the helicopter touched down softly at the approach end of the runway with a 
forward speed between 2 and 3 miles per hour.  Thereafter, the helicopter tipped forward, 
shook violently, and the main rotor blade contacted the airframe which resulted in substantial 
damage.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
