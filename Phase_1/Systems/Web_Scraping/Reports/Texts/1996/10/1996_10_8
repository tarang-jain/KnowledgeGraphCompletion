Location:
FINLEY, ND
Accident Number:
CHI97LA002
Date & Time:
10/03/1996, 0815 CDT 
Registration:
N185ND
Aircraft:
Cessna 185
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The airplane was parked on shore near a dock. The flight instructor (CFI) reported that after 
starting the engine, the airplane began to move forward, and the wing strut and wing cleared 
the dock. After the wing cleared the dock, the instructor began to lower the water rudders, and 
the tail of the airplane began moving toward the dock. A right crosswind was present during 
the departure from the shore. The instructor reported that full left rudder with the water 
rudders partially extended was ineffective in stopping the horizontal stabilizer of the airplane 
from hitting the dock.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
failure of the flight instructor (CFI) to ensure that clearance from the dock was maintained, 
while starting to taxi. The crosswind was a related factor. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: ON GROUND/WATER COLLISION WITH OBJECT
Phase of Operation: TAXI
Findings
1. (F) WEATHER CONDITION - CROSSWIND
2. (C) CLEARANCE - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND(CFI)

Factual Information
 On October 3, 1996, at 0815 central daylight time (cdt), a Cessna 185, N185ND, sustained 
substantial damage when the airplane's horizontal stabilizer collided with a dock.  The airplane 
was taxiing for takeoff, on Golden Lake, near Finley, North Dakota, when the accident 
occurred.  The flight instructor and student pilot were uninjured in the accident.  The 14 CFR 
Part 91 flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions, and no flight plan had been 
filed.
The flight instructor reported on NTSB form 6120.1/2 that the airplane was parked on the 
shore near the dock.  Before departing the shore the instructor reported that she and the 
student discussed the departure, and believed that distance between the dock and the airplane 
did not appear to present a problem during departure.
The instructor reported that after starting the airplane's engine the airplane began to move 
forward, and the wing strut and wing cleared the dock.  After clearing the dock with the wing 
the instructor reported that she began to lower the water rudders, and the tail of the airplane 
began moving towards the dock.  The diagram included with the report shows that the aircraft 
was experiencing a right crosswind during the departure from shore.  The instructor reported 
that full left rudder with the water rudders partially extended was ineffective in stopping the 
horizontal of the airplane from hitting the dock.  The pilot did not report any airplane or engine 
malfunctions.  
The airplane's horizontal stabilizer required replacement, following the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
