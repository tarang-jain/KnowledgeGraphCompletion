Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
PEYTON, CO
Accident Number:
FTW96LA197
Date & Time:
05/01/1996, 2145 MDT 
Registration:
N175WW
Aircraft:
Piper PA-28R-201T
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot said that after making a normal landing, the airplane began wobbling.  It then veered 
slowly to right and the right wing struck a taxiway sign.  The pilot said he had checked the tire 
pressures two weeks before the accident and found them correctly inflated to 30 psi.  Also, the 
tires appeared normal during his preflight inspection prior to the accident flight.  Postflight 
inspection, however, revealed the right tire was flat.  When the hub cap was removed, the valve 
stem fell out.  It had separated from the tire tube. The pilot said it appeared the valve stem had 
not completely bonded to the tube. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the failure of the right main tire due to valve stem separation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
