Factual Information
 On January 4, 1996, at 1835 eastern standard time (est), a Piper PA-31-350, N111UC, 
registered to Executive Aviation Group, was substantially damaged following a loss of control 
during the landing roll on runway 36 (5,500'x 100'), at the Indianapolis Terry Airport, 
Indianapolis, Indiana.  The airline transport pilot reported no injuries.  The 14 CFR Part 91 
flight was operating in instrument meteorological conditions.  An IFR flight plan had been 
filed.  The flight originated from Cleveland, Ohio, at 1730 est. 
According to the pilot's written statement, while executing the ILS approach to runway 36, he 
gained visual contact with the runway two miles out. He also stated that during landing, the left 
main wheel stuck deep snow and the airplane turned to the left exiting the left side of the 
runway. 
Post accident examination of the airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration Principal 
Maintenance Inspector (PMI), stated that the airplane touched down 42 feet left of centerline 
and 8 feet right of the runway edge which was covered by approximately 30 inch deep 
snowdrifts.  The PMI stated that the pilot allowed the airplane to drift left about 500 feet down 
the runway where the left gear encountered the snowdrifts causing the airplane to turn left and 
become totally engulfed in the deep snow.  The airport manager/owner stated that a NOTAM 
(D) was issued for 2 foot snow banks at the sides with 75 feet width cleared for the runway 
used.  The runway surface was covered with 1 3/4 inches of dry powdery snow.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
