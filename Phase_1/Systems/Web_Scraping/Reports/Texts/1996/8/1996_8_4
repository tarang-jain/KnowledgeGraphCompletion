Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
SPOKANE, WA
Accident Number:
SEA96LA181
Date & Time:
08/01/1996, 0000  
Registration:
N2839V
Aircraft:
Beech 35
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
About five minutes after takeoff, at 6,500 feet, the 1947 model airplane was cruising at 160 to 
165 knots, when it encountered turbulence and experienced an airframe vibration. The pilot 
reduced airspeed, which eliminated the vibration, then he landed without further incident. 
Subsequent examination revealed that the fuselage station 256.9 bulkhead, located directly 
below the leading edge of the V-tail, was cracked at all four corners. Further investigation 
revealed that the airplane's ruddervators had been removed in 1995 for reskinning due to 
corrosion. Reskinning was accomplished with Beech factory replacement skins, and the 
ruddervators were then painted with several layers of paint. This necessitated the installation 
of an additional one-pound (lead) weight on the outboard tip of each ruddervator to achieve 
correct control surface balance. Also, the pilot stated that he could not be sure whether the 
station 256.9 bulkhead was damaged in flight, or when the ruddervator contacted a hangar 
support beam as the airplane was being pushed in a hangar. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
failure (cracking) of the aft fuselage bulkhead for undetermined reason(s).

Factual Information
 On August 1, 1996, a Beech 35, N2839V, encountered turbulence and experienced a 
subsequent airframe vibration at 160 to 165 knots airspeed and 6,500 feet altitude 
approximately five minutes after takeoff from Felts Field, Spokane, Washington, en route to 
Colville, Washington.  The private pilot, who was not injured in the occurrence, reduced 
airspeed (which eliminated the vibration) and returned to Felts Field, where he landed without 
further incident.  A subsequent airframe examination revealed that the fuselage station 256.9 
bulkhead, located directly below the leading edge of the V-tail, was cracked at all four corners.  
The pilot reported to an FAA inspector from Spokane, Washington, that visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed at the time of the turbulence encounter.  The time of the occurrence was 
not reported.
The FAA aircraft registry indicated that the airplane was manufactured in 1947.  FAA 
inspectors determined that the aircraft's ruddervators were removed in 1995 for reskinning due 
to corrosion.  Reskinning was accomplished with Beech factory replacement skins and the 
ruddervators were then painted with several layers of paint, necessitating an additional pound 
of lead weight to be added to the outboard tip of each ruddervator in order to achieve correct 
control surface balance.  Discussions with the Spokane FAA inspector assigned to the accident 
indicated that the one-pound weights were installed in addition to the parts specified by the 
aircraft maintenance manual for balancing the ruddervators, and were not an approved 
installation per the aircraft maintenance manual.  The aircraft maintenance manual allows up 
to 11 lead washers of unspecified weight to be used in balancing the ruddervators.  The Spokane 
FAA inspector reported that an examination of the ruddervators revealed them to be correctly 
balanced with the non-approved one-pound weights installed.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
