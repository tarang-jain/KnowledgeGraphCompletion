Factual Information
On October 2, 2007, at 1030 mountain standard time, a Cessna 172N, N6291D, sustained 
substantial damage during a precautionary landing subsequent to a partial loss of engine 
power near Green Valley, Arizona.  The two occupants, the private pilot and passenger, were 
not injured.  The aircraft was operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) personal flight under the 
provisions of Title 14, CFR Part 91.  The airplane was owned by Tucson Aeroservice Center of 
Marina, Arizona.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed.  The 
local flight originated from Marana Regional Airport, Tucson, Arizona, approximately 30 
minutes prior to the accident. 
In a written statement, the pilot reported that during cruise flight, the engine began to run 
rough and periodically backfire.  The pilot attempted to troubleshoot the rough running engine 
without success and initiate a precautionary landing to a nearby road.  The airplane struck two 
road signs and a barbwire fence during the landing rollout.  
Examination of the engine, by the Operator and a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
Inspector, revealed that the number three cylinder exhaust rocker arm was disconnected from 
the cylinder due to the rocker arm hold down nut backing off.  Review of aircraft maintenance 
records showed that 13.4 hours prior to the accident, the number one and three cylinders were 
removed to facilitate repairs to the cylinder hold down studs.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
