Location:
Anaktuvuk Pass, AK
Accident Number:
ANC07CA072
Date & Time:

Registration:
N40832
Aircraft:
Piper PA-18
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Business
Analysis   
The commercial certificated pilot was landing the tundra tire-equipped, tailwheel airplane at 
an unimproved, off-airport site under Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred.  
According to the pilot, during the base leg of the approach for landing, the engine lost power, 
and the airplane collided with terrain during an emergency descent/landing.  The airplane's 
owner reported that he observed the airplane's preflight inspection, and watched the pilot 
sump the fuel tanks, finding a small quantity of water in the tanks.  He said the airplane 
departed, and upon returning, during landing, the engine lost power.  While inspecting the 
airplane after the accident, the owner said he found water in the airplane's gascolator, 
carburetor, and fuel lines.  He said the airplane was fueled from drums with filters, and it had 
rained during the preceding days.   He said he suspected water contaminated fuel was the 
cause of the engine stoppage, and that after refueling the airplane with clean fuel, the engine 
started and ran without any problems.  The owner said the airplane received damage to its 
fuselage, wings, lift-struts, and landing gear during the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate preflight inspection, which resulted in a loss of engine power during 
approach due to water contaminated fuel.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
