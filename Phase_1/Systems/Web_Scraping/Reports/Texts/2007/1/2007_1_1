Registration:
N821GS
Aircraft:
Piper PA-34-200T

Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The airplane was in cruise flight at 12,500 feet.  The pilot told his wife that he was disengaging 
the autopilot to maneuver over the mountains.  He then pressed the trim-disengage button on 
the control yoke.  Shortly after, the airplane began rolling uncontrollably to the left and right.  
The pilot steadied the airplane with the rudder.  He then began a 1/2 standard rate left turn.  
When he went to roll the airplane right, he said that the flight controls were difficult to 
manipulate.  He attempted additional turns and found the problem continued.  The pilot 
changed airspeed and found the problem increased with reduced airspeed.  After that, he 
declared an emergency with air traffic control, began a descent, and proceeded to the nearest 
airport.  The pilot said he was unable to locate the airport so he elected to perform a wheels up 
landing on a snow-covered field.  During the landing, the airplane sustained substantial 
damage to the inboard left wing and the bottom left side of the forward fuselage.  An 
examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies that could explain the stiff controls.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot experiencing lateral flight control stiffness for undetermined reasons and the pilot's 
intentional wheels up landing. Factors were the snow covered and rough/uneven terrain.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
