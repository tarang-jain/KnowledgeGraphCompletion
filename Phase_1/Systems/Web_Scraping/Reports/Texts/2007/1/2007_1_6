Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Baldwin City, KS
Accident Number:
DEN07LA044
Date & Time:
01/03/2007, 1505 CST 
Registration:
N113JD
Aircraft:
Marino Exec 162F-1995
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
Approximately 15 minutes into the flight, the tail rotor failed, and the helicopter entered an 
uncommanded turn to the left.  The pilot initiated an autorotation to an opening in a wooded 
area.  The pilot flared the helicopter over the trees, and the helicopter settled into the trees.  As 
the pilot increased the collective, the helicopter rolled to the left and came to rest inverted in 
the trees.  Examination of the helicopter by the pilot and a mechanic revealed that the tail rotor 
drive system uses three belts interconnected via pulleys at various points in the tail boom, to 
drive the tail rotor.  The intermediate tail rotor drive belt was shredded and destroyed.  The 
forward and aft tail rotor drive belts were intact and undamaged.  At the time of the accident, 
the tail rotor drive belts had accumulated approximately 80 hours.  The tail rotor drive belts 
had a life limit of 250 hours.  The reason for the failure of the tail rotor drive belt could not be 
determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the failure of the tail rotor drive belt for undetermined reasons.  A contributing factor was the 
lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.

Factual Information
On January 3, 2007, at 1505 central standard time, a Marino Exec 162F-1995 single-engine 
homebuilt helicopter, N113JD, sustained substantial damage when it impacted trees and 
terrain during a forced landing following a loss of control near Baldwin City, Kansas.  The 
airline transport pilot sustained serious injuries and the passenger sustained minor injuries.  
The helicopter was registered to and operated by the pilot.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed, and a flight plan was not filed for the Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 
personal flight.  The local flight departed Paola, Kansas, approximately 1500, and was en route 
to Lawrence, Kansas.
According to the pilot, approximately 15 minutes into the flight, the "tail rotor failed," and the 
helicopter entered an uncommanded turn to the left.  The pilot initiated an autorotation to an 
opening in a wooded area.  The pilot flared the helicopter over the trees, and the helicopter 
settled into the trees.  As the pilot increased the collective, the helicopter rolled to the left and 
came to rest inverted in the trees.  The fuselage and tail boom sustained substantial damage 
and the main rotor blades were destroyed.
Examination of the helicopter by the pilot and a mechanic revealed that the tail rotor drive 
system uses three belts interconnected via pulleys at various points in the tail boom, to drive 
the tail rotor.  The intermediate tail rotor drive belt was shredded and destroyed.  The forward 
and aft tail rotor drive belts were intact and undamaged.  At the time of the accident, the tail 
rotor drive belts had accumulated approximately 80 hours.  The tail rotor drive belts had a life 
limit of 250 hours.  The reason for the failure of the tail rotor drive belt could not be 
determined.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
