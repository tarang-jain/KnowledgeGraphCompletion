Analysis   
According to the pilot, he inadvertently bounced the airplane two times while performing a 
landing on runway 26. He elected to abort the landing and perform a go-around. The pilot 
stated that after the second bounce he lost his crosswind correction and the airplane departed 
the runway to the north. One of the main landing gear contacted the ground and dug in. The 
airplane rotated around 120 to 180 degrees and came to rest on its belly, resulting in 
substantial damage. An examination of the airplane's systems revealed no anomalies.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control during the landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
