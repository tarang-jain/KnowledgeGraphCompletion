Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot stated that he departed from the Okeechobee Airport and headed toward the lake to 
practice touch and go landings on the water. When he arrived at the lake, he turned into the 
wind, which caused the nose of the airplane to rise. He over corrected, causing the nose to dip 
sharply. He had his hand on the throttle. The abrupt movement made him apply full throttle 
and push the flight controls to the left, which made the airplane make a sharp left turn 
throwing him out the right side of the airplane. The airplane leveled itself off and flew about a 
mile before it came down and flipped over in the shallow water. A friend, who was flying with 
him in his own airplane, saw what had happened. The friend called for help and got the 
attention of a nearby fisherman, who came to his aid and brought him to the shore.  The pilot 
stated that there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions to the airplane or any of its 
systems prior to the accident. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during landing, which resulted 
in the pilot being inadvertently ejected and the airplane's impact with the water during an 
uncontrolled descent.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
