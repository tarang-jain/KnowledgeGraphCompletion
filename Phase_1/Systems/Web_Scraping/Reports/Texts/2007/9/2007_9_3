Analysis   
The 1,300-hour private pilot lost directional control of the tail-wheel equipped homebuilt 
airplane during takeoff roll from Runway 16.  The pilot reported that shortly after reaching the 
first 200-feet of his takeoff roll, the airplane started to veer to the left of the centerline and 
eventually ran-off the runway.  The pilot stated the runway was elevated from the surrounding 
terrain and when the airplane ran off the left side of the runway, the airplane banked to the 
right and the right wing collided with the ground and the airplane nosed-over.  The FAA 
inspector, who responded to the site of the accident, did not find any anomalies with the flight 
controls, tailwheel steering system or the brakes.  A passenger seated on the right front seat of 
the airplane provided a copy of a short video clip confirming the sequence of events.  The 
Runway 16 was described as a 3,000 -foot long by 50-foot wide asphalt airstrip.  Weather 10 
nautical miles south of the airport was reported 10 minutes prior to the accident to be winds 
from 110 at 9 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, with a  broken layer at 7,500 feet and an 
overcast layer at 10,000-feet.  The temperature was reported as 28-degrees Celsius, with a dew 
point at 17-degrees Celsius, with an altimeter of 30.13 inches of Mercury.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to compensate for the existing wind conditions.  A contributing factor was 
the prevailing crosswind.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
