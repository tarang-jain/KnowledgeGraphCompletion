Analysis   
While executing an aborted landing, the nose wheel of the airplane snagged a barbed wire 
fence and the airplane nosed over on its back.  The pilot stated that he arrived over the 
destination airport and circled to check the grass strip for obstructions and general field 
conditions.  Satisfied with the appearance of the runway he decided to land.  Towards the end 
of the landing rollout he felt that the tires were sinking and dragging excessively.  Fearing 
getting stuck, he elected to abort the landing and continue with a takeoff.  After liftoff, the 
airplane failed to clear a barbed wire fence at the end of the runway and the nose landing gear 
tire snagged the fence and the airplane nosed over on its back.  The pilot stated that the 
airplane and engine had no mechanical failures or malfunctions during the flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to abort the landing with insufficient runway available to gurantee 
obstruction clearance.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
