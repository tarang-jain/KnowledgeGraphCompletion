Location:
West Chicago, IL
Accident Number:
CHI07CA128
Date & Time:
05/01/2007, 1650 CDT 
Registration:
N97224
Aircraft:
Cessna 172P
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The airplane impacted a ditch following an uncontrolled exit from the runway surface (runway 
33, 3,401 feet long, 100 foot wide, dry concrete).    The instructor reported that after 
touchdown, the power was increased but the airplane yawed into the left crosswind.  The 
airplane then exited the runway into the grass adjacent to the runway.  The instructor stated 
that the main gear dragged in the grass and the nose gear dug into the ground.  The airplane 
then pivoted to the right and the left wingtip impacted and dragged through the grass.   The 
reported wind conditions about the time of the accident were from 280 magnetic degrees at 13 
knots, gusting to 21 knots.  Inspection of the airplane did not reveal any flight control or 
mechanical malfunction that would have prevented normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The instructor's inadequate remedial action following the student pilot's loss of control during 
the crosswind landing and the instructor's failure to compensate for the wind conditions.  
Contributing factors were, the crosswind, the gusting wind conditions and the ditch.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
