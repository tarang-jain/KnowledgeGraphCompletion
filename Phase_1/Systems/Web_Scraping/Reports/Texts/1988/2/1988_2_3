Analysis 
THE CREW RPRTD THAT DRG TAKEOFF, A POWER SURGE OCCURRED AFTER THE 
ACFT HAD CLIMBED ABOUT 400 TO 500 FT. THE COPLT SAW WHAT HE LATER SAID 
WAS A RIGHT FUEL FLOW FLUCTUATION & TOLD THE PLT (PIC) THAT THE RIGHT 
ENG WAS LOSING POWER. THE PIC TOLD THE COPLT TO SECURE THE ENG. 
ANTICIPATING NO SERIOUS PROBLEM, THE PIC INTENDED TO REMAIN IN THE 
PATTERN & MAKE A SINGLE ENG LANDING. HOWEVER, HE WAS UNABLE TO MAINT 
SPEED WITHOUT DSCNDG & WAS FORCED TO LAND. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE ACFT 
WENT THRU A FENCE, CROSSED A RAILROAD TRACK & STOPPED ON A ROAD. DRG AN 
OPNL CHECK OF THE ENGS, THE RIGHT ENG STARTED & RAN NORMALLY. HOWEVER, 
THE LEFT ENG WAS DIFFICULT TO START & WOULD NOT RUN ABOVE 1000 RPM 
UNTIL ANOTHER FUEL METERING VALVE WAS INSTALLED. A TEARDOWN OF THE 
FAULTY METERING VALVE REVEALED CONTAMINATION FROM AN UNKNOWN 
SOURCE. ALSO, THE LEFT FUEL PUMP DISCHARGE PRESSURE WAS FOUND TO BE 62 
PSI. AN ADJUSTMENT OF THE ALTITUDE ANEROID CONTROL RETURNED THE PUMP 
DISCHARGE PRESSURE TO WITHIN THE MAX LIMIT OF 32.5 PSI.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
