Analysis 
 THE STUDENT PILOT LANDED HARD AND BOUNCED THE AIRPLANE BACK INTO THE 
AIR ABOUT 20 FEET.  THE INSTRUCTOR TOOK OVER THE CONTROLS BUT WAS 
UNABLE TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE BEFORE IT STALLED AND STRUCK THE 
RUNWAY WITH THE LEFT WING AND TAIL.  THE AIRPLANE THEN DEPARTED THE 
LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY, STRIKING A RUNWAY LIGHT.  THERE WERE NO 
MECHANICAL FAILURES OR MALFUNCTIONS WITH THE AIRPLANE BEFORE THE 
ACCIDENT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 IMPROPER RECOVERY FROM A BOUNCED LANDING BY THE STUDENT PILOT AND 
THE DELAYED REMEDIAL ACTION OF THE INSTRUCTOR PILOT.  CONTRIBUTING TO 
THIS ACCIDENT WAS THE STUDENT PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THE PROPER 
DESCENT RATE WHICH RESULTED IN A BOUNCED LANDING AND THE CERTIFIED 
INSTRUCTOR PILOT'S INADEQUATE SUPERVISION DURING THE LANDING.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
