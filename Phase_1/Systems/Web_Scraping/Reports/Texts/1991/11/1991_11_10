Analysis 
 IN HIS WRITTEN STATEMENT THE PILOT SAID THAT WHILE REDUCING POWER 
DURING A STRAIGHT IN APPROACH FOR LANDING, THE ENGINE HAD A TOTAL LOSS 
OF POWER. THE PILOT EXECUTED A POWER OFF, GEAR UP FORCED LANDING IN A 
CONGESTED AREA.  THE AIRCRAFT LANDED ON ROUGH, UNEVEN TERRAIN CAUSING 
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.  THE PILOT THOUGHT THE ENGINE MAY HAVE HAD A VAPOR 
LOCK.  FAA INSPECTORS EXAMINED THE AIRCRAFT AND FOUND ABOUT 8 GALLONS 
OF NON-CONTAMINATED FUEL IN EACH FUEL TANK.  THEY ALSO PERFORMED AN 
OPERATIONAL CHECK ON THE ENGINE AND OPERATED THE ENGINE THROUGHOUT 
NORMAL OPERATIONAL LIMITS WITH NO ABNORMALITIES NOTED.  AIRCRAFT 
RECORDS WERE REVIEWED WITH NO DISCREPANCIES NOTED.  ALL AIRWORTHINESS 
DIRECTIVES, INCLUDING THOSE PERTAINING TO VAPOR LOCK, WERE NOTED AS 
BEING COMPLIED WITH.  NO CAUSE FOR THE POWER LOSS WAS FOUND. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DUE TO UNKNOWN REASON(S).  A FACTOR IN 
THIS ACCIDENT WAS THE LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN TO LAND THE AIRPLANE, 
WITHOUT INCURRING DAMAGE TO THE AIRPLANE.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
