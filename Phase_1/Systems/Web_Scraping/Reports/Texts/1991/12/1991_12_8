Analysis 
 ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, HE ENCOUNTERED THE FORECAST HEAD WINDS EN 
ROUTE AND HE INTENTIONALLY RAN THE LEFT TANK DRY AND WAS FLYING ON THE 
RIGHT TANK DURING THE DESCENT WHEN IT ALSO RAN DRY. HE STATED THAT AT 
THE TIME OF THE TANK CHANGE HE THOUGHT ABOUT REQUESTING AN 
ALTERNATE, BUT DID NOT. AFTER THE ENGINE FAILURE THE PILOT WAS GIVEN 
RADAR VECTORS TO THE FINAL LOCALIZER APPROACH COURSE OF A NEARBY 
AIRPORT; HOWEVER, HE HAD INSUFFICIENT ALTITUDE TO REACH THE RUNWAY. HE 
BROKE OUT AT 700 FEET AND WAS ABLE TO LAND ON A PLAYING FIELD ADJACENT 
TO A CHURCH IN AN URBAN AREA. AFTER ROLLING ABOUT 234 FEET, THE AIRPLANE 
STRUCK A BASEBALL BACK STOP AND CAME TO REST IN THE CHURCH PARKING LOT. 
THE PILOT'S FUEL CALCULATIONS INDICATED THAT HE HAD 6.5 HOURS TO FUEL 
EXHAUSTION, WHILE ACTUAL FUEL EXHAUSTION OCCURRED AFTER 5.5 HOURS. THE 
LEFT TANK RAN DRY AT 2.6 HOURS AND THE RIGHT RAN DRY AT 2.9 HOURS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 FUEL EXHAUSTION WHICH PRECIPITATED THE FORCED LANDING DUE TO THE 
PILOT'S INADEQUATE FUEL CONSUMPTION CALCULATIONS. A FACTOR IN THE 
ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO DIVERT TO AN ALTERNATE DESTINATION 
WHEN HE RECOGNIZED THAT FUEL EXHAUSTION WAS A POSSIBILITY.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
