Analysis 
 AERIAL APPLICATION PASSES WERE BEING MADE NORTH TO SOUTH WITH EACH 
PASS BEING BENEATH CROSS COUNTRY POWER LINES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
FIELD. ONE FLAGMAN WAS POSITIONED AT ONE END OF THE FIELD WITH A SECOND 
BENEATH THE POWER LINES. DURING THE SIXTH PASS, FOR UNKNOWN REASONS, 
THE FLAGMAN FAILED TO MOVE AS THE AIRPLANE APPROACHED. ACCORDING TO 
THE PILOT, 'DUE TO THE HEIGHT OF THE WIRES AND THEIR CLOSE PROXIMITY, I 
WAS COMMITTED TO PASS UNDER THEM.' HE UNSUCCESSFULLY ATTEMPTED TO 
PASS BENEATH THE WIRES AND OVER THE FLAGMAN. THE LEFT MAIN GEAR STRUCK 
THE FLAGMAN AND THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH A LEVEE BEFORE CONTROL 
COULD BE REGAINED. AN UNEVENTFUL LANDING FOLLOWED. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE FAILURE OF THE FLAGMAN TO FOLLOW ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
