Analysis 
The aerial application airplane overran the runway into a field during takeoff.  According to the 
Federal Aviation Administration inspector, the pilot stated that he never reduced the throttle in 
an attempt to abort the takeoff from runway 11 (2,000 feet by 75, grass), which was dry and 
mowed at the time of the accident.  The pilot stated that he thought the engine was not 
developing full power because it used up the entire runway length in the takeoff attempt.  The 
airplane was powered by a Pratt & Whitney, R-1340-AN1, serial number 31239 engine.  No 
subsequent engine anomalies were reported.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The aborted takeoff not performed by the pilot.  A contributing factor is the reported loss of 
takeoff performance.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
