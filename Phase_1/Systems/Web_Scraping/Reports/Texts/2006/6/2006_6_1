Location:
Dighton, KS
Accident Number:
DEN06CA081
Date & Time:
06/01/2006, 1700 CDT 
Registration:
N14RY
Aircraft:
Grumman G-164B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis   
The airplane was taking off on an aerial application flight.  Shortly after lifting off, the 
airplane's engine lost power.  The commercial pilot set the airplane down on the runway 
toward the departure end.  The airplane went off the end of the runway and into a wheat field.  
The airplane's main gear tires sank into the soft wet soil and the airplane subsequently nosed 
over causing the engine to fracture and separate from the fuselage and crushing the vertical 
stabilizer and rudder downward.  The pilot sustained minor injuries.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  An examination of the airplane's engine 
revealed that the rocker arm boss on the number 1 cylinder had fractured leaving the exhaust 
valve on the cylinder closed and resulting in the subsequent engine failure.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The broken rocker arm boss causing the number 1 cylinder exhaust valve to stay closed and 
subsequently the engine failed.  A factor contributing to the accident was the soft field the 
airplane set down in.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
