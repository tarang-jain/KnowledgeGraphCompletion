Substantial

Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot reported that after an uneventful landing on Runway 26L, he attempted to 
exit the runway by making a right turn onto Taxiway Echo.  During the turn, the airplane's left 
wing struck the surface of the runway and an elevated taxiway light stanchion.  As a result, the 
airplane's left wing sustained substantial damage.  When asked by the NTSB IIC if there were 
any preaccident mechanical anomalies that may have contributed to the accident, the pilot 
said, in part: "No, I guess I was just going a bit fast for the turn."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's excessive taxi speed while turning, which resulted in an on ground collision with a 
taxiway light and the ground.

Factual Information
On March 4, 2006, about 1403 pacific standard time, a wheel equipped Piper PA-24 airplane, 
N9220P, sustained substantial damage while landing at the Brackett Field Airport, La Verne, 
California.  The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) personal cross 
country flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred.  The private pilot and 
the sole passenger were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight 
plan was filed. The flight originated at the El Monte Airport, El Monte, California, about 1345.
During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
investigator-in-charge (IIC) on March 4, the pilot reported that after an uneventful landing on 
Runway 26L, he attempted to exit the runway by making a right turn onto Taxiway Echo.  
During the turn, the airplane's left wing struck the surface of the runway and an elevated 
taxiway light stanchion.  As a result, the airplane's left wing sustained substantial damage.  
When asked by the NTSB IIC if there were any preaccident mechanical anomalies that may 
have contributed to the accident, the pilot said, in part: "No, I guess I was just going a bit fast 
for the turn." 
The pilot did not complete the NTSB Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB Form 
6120.1)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
