Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
With the eventual goal of earning a sport pilot certificate, an ultralight pilot and a 1,141-hour 
flight instructor planned to conduct a familiarization training flight in an experimental, tandem 
seat airplane.   During the take-off roll, with the ultralight pilot occupying the front seat and 
operating the controls, the airplane "ballooned."  The ultralight pilot reduced engine power and 
performed a normal landing.  During the second take-off from Runway 16 (a 3,200-foot long 
by 50-foot wide asphalt runway), "the airplane ballooned more than before" and the pilot 
elected to reduce the engine power and land.  The ultralight pilot stated that "the flare did not 
fully develop and [the airplane] landed harder than usual."  During the landing, the right main 
landing gear and the nose landing gear collapsed.   In the Recommendation section of the 
NTSB Form 6120.1, (How could this accident have been prevented ?), the ultralight pilot stated 
that the accident could have been prevented " with the judicious use of throttle in the flare, or if 
I had carried more airspeed to compensate for the possible loss of a gusting headwind."  The 
winds at the time of the accident were reported as variable at 8 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare and inadequate recovery from a bounced landing which 
resulted in a hard landing.  A factor was the delayed remedial action by the flight instructor.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
