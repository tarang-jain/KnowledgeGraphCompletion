Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Crookston, MN
Accident Number:
CHI07FA032
Date & Time:
12/01/2006, 1830 CST 
Registration:
N9850G
Aircraft:
CESSNA 
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane took off in deteriorating meteorological conditions and impacted the ground 
about 1 mile from the departure airport, fatally injuring both occupants. The pilot held a 
private pilot certificate and had accumulated 102.5 hours of total flight experience but only 4.6 
hours of simulated instrument experience; he had no actual flying experience in instrument 
conditions. Near the time of the accident, the weather was reported as a ceiling of 200 feet 
above the ground with snow and 1 mile of visibility. It is likely that the non-instrument rated 
private pilot™s decision to take off in deteriorating weather conditions was due to his lack of 
flying experience; once he took off into the instrument meteorological conditions, he became 
spatially disoriented and was unable to maintain control of the airplane. Examination of the 
airplane revealed no pre-impact anomalies.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadvertent flight into instrument meteorological conditions which led to his spatial 
disorientation and subsequent loss of control.  Factors were the snow, the low ceiling, and the 
pilot's lack of instrument flight experience.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On December 1, 2006, about 1830 central standard time, a Cessna 172L, N9850G, piloted by a 
private pilot, was destroyed when it impacted terrain near Crookston, Minnesota.  The 14 CFR 
Part 91 personal flight was operating in instrument meteorological conditions without a flight 
plan.  The local flight originated from the Crookston Municipal Airport-Kirkwood Field (CKN), 
about 1815.
A witness reported seeing two people removing the accident airplane from a hangar at 1800.  
He stated that he saw the accident airplane outside of the hangar and that the two people were 
pushing another airplane back into the hangar.  He reported that he did not see the people 
board the airplane, nor did he see the airplane take off.
At 1850, an emergency locator transmitter signal was detected by the Air Force Rescue and 
Coordination Center.  The Civil Air Patrol, local authorities, and the CKN airport manager were 
contacted regarding the ELT signal.  A ground search was begun and the airplane was located 
about 0300 on December 2, 2006.  The aircraft was located in a harvested farm field about 1 
mile southwest of CKN.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
The pilot held a private pilot certificate with a single engine land rating issued on July 1, 2006.  
The pilot also held a third class medical certificate that was issued on December 23, 2004.  No 
limitations were listed on the medical certificate.
Examination of the pilot's flight logbook revealed that he had accumulated 102.5 total hours of 
flight experience including 30.3 hours in Cessna 172 airplanes, 19.7 hours in the previous 90 
days and 5.0 hours in the previous 30 days.  The pilot's logbook showed that he had 
accumulated 4.6 hours of simulated instrument flight time and no flight experience in actual 
instrument conditions.
The right seat passenger held a student pilot certificate and first class medical certificate issued 
on July 27, 2006.  
Examination of the passenger's flight logbook revealed that he had accumulated 42.9 hours of 
total flight experience.  No flight time in Cessna aircraft was listed in the passenger's logbook.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
The airplane was a 1971 Cessna 172L airplane, serial number 17259750.  It was a single engine, 
strut braced, high-wing monoplane of predominately aluminum construction.  The airplane 
had a fixed tricycle landing gear. It was powered by a Lycoming O-320-E2D engine, serial 
number L-36326-27A, rated to produce 160 horsepower.  This engine had been installed on the 
airplane in accordance to a supplemental type certificate.
Examination of the aircraft maintenance records indicated that the airplane had been 
inspected in accordance with an annual inspection on July 17, 2006, at a recording tachometer 
reading of 6,099.6 hours.  The records also showed that the airplane was inspected in 
accordance with a 100 hour inspection on October 26, 2006, at a recording tachometer time of 
6,196.6 hours.  The records indicated that the airplane had accumulated 10,495.8 hours total 
Page 4 of 8CHI07FA032
time, and the engine had accumulated 1,304.3 hours since its most recent overhaul as of the 
date of the 100 hour inspection.  The engine's most recent overhaul was performed on January 
7, 2003.

Weather radar images for the Grand Forks Doppler radar site showed precipitation near CKN 
at the time of the accident.  The images showed the base reflectivity of the radar returns near 
CKN of 5-10 dBZ at 1702 which increased to 20-25 dBZ at 1732, and then to 25-30 dBZ at 1825.
COMMUNICATIONS
At 1602, on the day of the accident, a call was placed to the Princeton, Minnesota, Automated 
Flight Service Station.  The caller requested a standard weather briefing for a local flight from 
CKN, and identified N9850G as the aircraft.  The briefer informed the caller of an approaching 
frontal boundary and scattered snow showers near CKN.  The forecast for Grand Forks, North 
Dakota, that the briefer gave the caller was for ceilings of 6,000 feet broken for one hour 
followed by 4,000 feet overcast with areas of light snow.  The briefer stated that the forecast 
was expected to run through the night and that visibilities were expected to remain 7 miles or 
better.  The briefer continued with the area forecast for northwestern Minnesota, which called 
for 1,500 feet scattered clouds, 5,000 foot broken ceilings with occasional visibilities of 5 miles 
and snow development.
No records of radio communications with the accident airplane during the accident flight were 
found.
AIRPORT INFORMATION
CKN is an uncontrolled airport located in northwestern Minnesota and is served by three 
intersecting runways.  Runway 13/31 is 4,300 feet by 75 feet, asphalt; runway 17/35 is 2,978 
feet by 202 feet, turf; and runway 6/24 is 2,089 feet by 202 feet.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The airplane came to rest at coordinates 47 degrees, 49.760 minutes north latitude, 96 degrees, 
Page 5 of 8CHI07FA032
38.229 minutes west longitude.  An impact mark was located about 170 feet and 60 degrees 
from the main wreckage.  All aircraft components were located along a line extending 240 
degrees from the initial impact mark.  
The main wreckage consisted of the fuselage, empennage and wings.  All flight control surfaces 
remained attached to the main wreckage with the exception of the outboard section of the right 
aileron.  The detached portion of the right aileron was found about 20 feet from the main 
wreckage.  The fuselage was crushed rearward and the aft fuselage was buckled aft of the main 
cabin.  The aft fuselage was folded up over the cabin section.  The empennage remained 
attached to the aft fuselage.  The elevators and rudder remained attached to their respective 
surfaces.  The wings remained partially attached to the cabin section.  The engine was 
separated from the fuselage and was found about 40 feet from the main wreckage.  The 
propeller was detached from the engine and was found between the initial impact mark and the 
main wreckage.
The airplane was moved to a hangar at CKN where a layout of the aircraft components was 
conducted.
The right wing exhibited upward and rearward crushing from a position outboard of the fuel 
tank to the tip.  The upward crush angle was about 45 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis 
of the airplane.  Examination of the right aileron control system confirmed control cable 
continuity from the aileron to the cockpit yoke assembly and to the left aileron.
The left wing exhibited upward and rearward crushing from about mid-span to the wing tip.  
The upward crush angle was about 45 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis of the airplane. 
Examination of the left aileron control system confirmed control cable continuity from the 
aileron to the cockpit yoke assembly and to the right aileron.
The vertical tail and rudder remained attached to the aft fuselage.  Control cable continuity was 
confirmed from the rudder to the cockpit rudder pedals.
The horizontal tail and elevator remained attached to the aft fuselage.  The left stabilizer and 
elevator were bent upward at about mid-span.  The elevator trim tab remained attached to the 
elevator.  Control system continuity was confirmed from the elevator to the cockpit yoke 
assembly.
Examination of the engine confirmed rotation and continuity of the accessory section and valve 
train.  When rotated, the engine produced suction and compression in each cylinder.  One 
magneto remained attached to the engine and produced spark from each position of the plug 
wire cap when rotated by hand.  The other magneto was not located during the investigation.  
The upper spark plugs were removed and no defects were noted.  The oil screen was removed 
and was found to be free of contaminants.  Examination of the dry vacuum pump revealed that 
the core was fractured, and the drive coupling was intact.
No anomalies were found with respect to the airframe, engine, or airplane systems that could 
be determined to have existed prior to impact.  
The recording hour-meter that was in the airplane read 4,166.8 hours, and the recording 
tachometer read 6,226.9 hours during the wreckage examination.  A flight log sheet that was 
found showed that the accident pilot signed out the airplane on the day of the accident and that 
the starting hour-meter and recording tachometer readings were 4,166.6 hours 6,226.7 hours 
respectively.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
