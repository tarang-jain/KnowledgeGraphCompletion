Covington, LA
Accident Number:
DFW06CA117

Registration:
N42336
Aircraft:
Cessna 182L
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The 2,000-hour private pilot of the single-engine airplane experienced a total loss of engine 
power during the initial climb.  The pilot reported that about 400 feet above the ground (AGL), 
the engine "abruptly quit," and he attempted a left turn to attempt to return to the field; 
however, he impacted trees and then the ground before reaching the runway.  The pilot also 
reported that he had topped-off the fuel tanks with 34 gallons of 100LL fuel at the airport 4 
days earlier.  An examination of the wreckage revealed that the carburetor bowl was half filled 
with what appeared to be rusty water.  The gascolator was removed and examined.  It did not 
contain any fluid; however, the inside of the bowl contained a large amount of corrosion.  The 
wing fuel bladders tanks were empty, and no folds or obstructions were noted.  The left fuel 
tank was breached, and no fuel cap was present.  The vented right fuel cap was in good 
condition, with a pliable rubber gasket.  No other evidence of preimpact mechanical failure or 
malfunction was observed.  The airport fuel provider reported to the FAA that fuel samples 
were tested on the day of the accident and found to be within specification with no 
contaminants.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The total loss of engine power due to water contamination in the fuel system for undetermined 
reasons.  A contributing factor was the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
