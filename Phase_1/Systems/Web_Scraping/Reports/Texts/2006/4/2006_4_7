Substantial

2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
While transitioning from landing to taxiing the pilot experienced a bumping sound, which was 
followed by the collapse of the nose gear.  Examination of photographs of the damage revealed 
that several inches of the nose fuselage structure had been ground down by contact with the 
runway pavement.  The nose gear was examined by an airframe and power plant (A&P) 
mechanic.  The mechanic reported that the nose gear drive tube was bent inboard 90 degrees, 
suggesting that the nose over center adjustment was out of tolerance, and a sufficient impact 
could cause the gear to unlock from the down position.  There was no evidence of mechanical 
failure or foreign object damage.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The collapse of the nose gear due to an out of tolerance nose gear over center adjustment.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
