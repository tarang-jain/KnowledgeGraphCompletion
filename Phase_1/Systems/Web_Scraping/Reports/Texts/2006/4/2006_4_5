Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Grayslake, IL
Accident Number:
CHI06CA103
Date & Time:
04/02/2006, 1030 CDT 
Registration:
N8290X
Aircraft:
Piper PA-32-301
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The single-engine airplane veered off the left side of runway 9 (3,270 feet by 40 feet, asphalt) 
during landing and sustained substantial damage.  The winds 11 miles from the accident 
airport were 120 degrees at 11 knots gusting to 21 knots.  The pilot reported that he flew a 
Global Positioning System (GPS) approach and cancelled his instrument flight rules (IFR) 
flight plan when he had the airport in sight.  He entered a left downwind for landing on runway 
9 and confirmed a right crosswind condition by observing the windsock.  The airspeed was 90 
knots with a right "crab" on final approach to landing.  The pilot reported, "Prior to touchdown 
the wind calmed to the point that the crab was not needed."  He reported the airplane touched 
down on the centerline of the dry runway.  He reported, "Almost immediately after touchdown, 
the plane started moving left."  He reacted by putting in full right aileron and applying right 
rudder, but he did not apply any pressure to the toe brakes.  The airplane veered off the left 
side of the runway.  The airplane encountered soft terrain, spun around, and impacted a ditch.  
The inspection of the airplane revealed that the wheels spun freely when turned and the brakes 
did not stick.  The tires had no flat spots.  The inspection of the runway revealed that there was 
no long skid mark on the runway, but there were black skid marks about 2 feet in length that 
were about 20 feet apart.  There was no indication of braking when the airplane came in 
contact with the grass.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot failed to compensate adequately for the crosswind condition and failed to maintain 
directional control during the landing roll.  Contributing factors included the crosswind, the 
narrow runway, soft ground, and the ditch.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
