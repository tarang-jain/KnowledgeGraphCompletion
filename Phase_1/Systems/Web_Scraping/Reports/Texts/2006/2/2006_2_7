Analysis   
The 600-hour private pilot became lost during a 125-nautical mile dead reckoning cross-
country flight.  Running low on fuel, the pilot elected to land at a ranch.  Upon landing, the 
pilot realized that he was in Mexico, approximately 206 miles south of his intended 
destination.  The pilot quickly departed the ranch and flew in a northerly direction until he 
spotted a Texas flag.   Estimating that he had about 3 gallons of fuel remaining, the pilot 
elected to land on a gravel road before his remaining fuel was exhausted.  While on final 
approach to the gravel road, the pilot observed a tall fence running parallel to the road and 
elected to land off the road on rocky and uneven terrain.  While landing, the airplane's 
horizontal stabilizer sustained structural damage following impact with sagebrush and cactus 
plants.  The pilot reported that he did not have a navigational chart on board the airplane, and 
very strong winds aloft, with speeds up to 65 mph, prevailed throughout the area, forcing his 
airplane off-course.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate preflight planning and preparation leading to him becoming lost.  
Contributing  factors were the unfavorable winds and the lack of suitable terrain for a 
precautionary landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
