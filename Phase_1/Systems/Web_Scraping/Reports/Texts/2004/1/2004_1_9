Factual Information
On January 3, 2004, at 1333 eastern standard time, a Cessna 182G, N3102S, registered to a 
private owner, operating as a 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight, collided with an embankment on 
takeoff roll at Taylorsville Airport, Taylorsville, North Carolina. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The airplane sustained substantial damage. 
The private pilot reported minor injuries. The flight originated from Teague-Grider Airport, 
Taylorsville, North Carolina, on January 3, 2003, at 1333.
The pilot stated he started his takeoff roll on the west runway, and just before rotation his seat 
slid backwards. The pilot reported that he "lost directional control" of the airplane, and the 
airplane subsequently collided with an embankment.
Examination of the front seats revealed both seat track rails were buckled. The seat track pin 
holes were measured at 0.28 inches longitudinal and sideways dimensions.  Air Worthiness 
Directive 87-20-03R2, Seat Tracks,  requires inspection of all pin holes at 100 hour intervals. 
Replacement of the seat rail becomes mandatory once any dimension exceed 0.42.  No 
elongation of the seat track pin holes were noted.
Review of the Cessna 182 Pilot Operating Handbook, Section I, states in the BEFORE 
STARTING THE ENGINE checklist,
"(1) Seats and Seat Belts-Adjust and lock."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
