Location:
Algona, IA
Accident Number:
CHI04LA187
Date & Time:
07/02/2004, 1715 CDT 
Registration:
N3248T
Aircraft:
Beech A36
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
4 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Business
Analysis 
The airplane was substantially damaged during a forced landing on a road.  The pilot reported 
that while in level flight the engine "blew up."  He executed a forced landing on a road and 
elected to delay lowering of the landing gear until the airplane had cleared a car that was 
traveling in the opposite direction.  Once clear of the car, the pilot lowered the landing gear, 
but it did not fully extend due to the low altitude.  Examination of the engine revealed a hole in 
the crankcase adjacent to the number 6 connecting rod journal.  Additionally, the number 6 
connecting rod and piston were found fractured.  No determination could be made regarding 
the failure of the connecting rod.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the connecting rod which resulted in the loss of engine power during cruise flight 
and subsequent forced landing.  A contributing factor was the delayed lowering of the landing 
gear in order to clear the other vehicle encountered during the forced landing.

Factual Information
On July 2, 2004, about 1715 central daylight time, a Beech model A36, N3248T, piloted by a 
commercial pilot, was substantially damaged as a result of a forced landing following a loss of 
engine power and subsequent in-flight fire.  The 14 CFR Part 91 business flight was operating 
in visual meteorological conditions without a flight plan.  No injuries were reported.  The flight 
originated from the Mason City Municipal Airport, Mason City, Iowa, at 1630, and was bound 
for the Joe Foss Field Airport, Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
The pilot reported that about 15 minutes into the flight, while level at 4,500 feet mean sea level, 
the airplane engine "blew up."  The pilot stated that he executed a forced landing on a road.  He 
stated that he kept the landing gear retracted to insure that he could clear a car that was 
traveling in the opposite direction.  The pilot stated that once clear of the car he lowered the 
landing gear, but due to the low altitude, the landing gear did not fully extend before contact 
with the road occurred.
Examination of the engine revealed a hole in the top of the crankcase near the number 5 and 6 
cylinders.  The hole in the crankcase was aligned with the number 6 connecting rod journal.  
All of the engine accessories remained intact and attached to the engine. 
Fractured pieces of the number 6 connecting rod, piston and piston pin were found within the 
crankcase.  The fractured piston exhibited signatures consistent with overload failure.  The 
fracture surfaces of the connecting rod were smeared and no determination could be made 
concerning the fracture surfaces.
The number 5 piston was lodged within its cylinder.  The connecting rod remained attached to 
the piston.  The connecting rod cap was separated from the connecting rod.  The fracture 
surfaces were smeared and no determination could be made concerning the fracture surfaces.
Examination of the main bearings and the connecting rod bearings of the undamaged 
connecting rods revealed no evidence of oil starvation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
