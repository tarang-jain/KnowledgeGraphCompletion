Analysis   
According to the pilot,  the airplane collided with the top wire of a transmission tower that "was 
not visible to [him]." He stated that the airplane spun around 180 degrees to the left, the 
airplane "was out of control," collided with the ground, and came to rest inverted in a nearby 
field.  Examination of the wreckage site revealed the wreckage debris path extended across the 
field a distance of 75 feet leading up to the main wreckage site.  The tower arm of the 
transmission tower, that was estimated to be 100 feet high, was bent, and the upper 
transmission wire was separated. Examination of the wreckage revealed that the engine 
assembly separated from the engine mounts. The propeller hub was separated from the 
crankshaft.  The engine cowling and fuselage were crushed aft to the pilot compartment. The 
right wingtip was separated. The leading edge of the right wing was crushed beginning about 
midspan outboard to the end of the wing. The left wing was partially separated at the root and 
completely separated approximately midspan. The left horizontal stabilizer leading edge was 
crushed aft.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate visual lookout and failure to maintain adequate obstacle clearance, 
which resulted in collision with transmission wires.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
