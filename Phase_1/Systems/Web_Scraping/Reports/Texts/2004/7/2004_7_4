Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
During the takeoff and initial climb, the engine power was 100 rpm lower than expected, and 
the oil pressure decreased to 0.  The pilot initiated a left turn for a precautionary landing at the 
airport.  The engine continued to lose power during the approach, but it did not experience a 
total loss of power.  The airplane was not aligned with the centerline as it touched down on a 
runway, and traveled off the left side.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the pilot had 
recently installed a homemade oil cooler adapter on the certificated engine.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during a precautionary landing.  A factor was 
the pilot's unapproved maintenance modification resulting in the loss of oil pressure and 
partial loss of engine power.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
