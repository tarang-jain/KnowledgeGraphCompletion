Factual Information
On February 1, 2004, at 1700 eastern standard time, a Saab 340A, N158SD, operated by 
Shuttle America Inc., as US Airways Express flight 4593, was substantially damaged when it 
was struck by a baggage cart while parked at Gate E11 at Pittsburgh International Airport 
(PIT), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The two flightcrew members, one flight attendant, and 19 
passengers were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument 
flight rules flight plan had been filed for the flight which was destined for Toledo International 
Airport (TOL), Toledo, Ohio.  The scheduled passenger flight was to be conducted under 14 
CFR Part 121. 
According to the operator, the airplane was parked at the gate, when a baggage cart became 
disconnected from the tug which was towing it, and impacted the left side of the fuselage.  
Substantial damage to the airplane included a 23-inch tear in the fuselage, as well as five 
circumferential structure fractures.
Examination of the tug revealed a broken E-hitch pin where the baggage cart became 
disconnected.  Ground service personnel then examined all tugs and their associated baggage 
carts to identify any additional faulty gearshift levers.  During the inspection, one additional 
tug was identified as having a broken pin.  The pin was replaced, and the vehicle was returned 
to service.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
