Location:
Columbia, SC
Accident Number:
ATL05CA019
Date & Time:
11/02/2004, 1941 EST 
Registration:
N4874G
Aircraft:
Cessna 172N
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot declared a "mayday" 17 miles northeast of Columbia Metropolitan Airport, at 4,500 
feet and stated that his engine had lost power and that he was going to land in a parking lot.  
The airplane collided with power lines and the ground.  The post-accident examination of the 
fuel system revealed no fuel in either wing fuel tank, trace amounts of fuel in the fuel strainer, 
and trace amounts of fuel in the fuel line from the fuel strainer to the carburetor.   A functional 
check of the engine was accomplished and it produced power at idle and 1000 RPM.  The 
airplane was last topped off with fuel on October 31, 2004, and had flown 4.1 hours since that 
refueling. On the same day of the accident the pilot also completed a total of three takeoffs on 
the same fuel load. At 75 % engine power, the airplane has an endurance of 3.9 hours.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate preflight planning of fuel required for the flight, which resulted in fuel 
exhaustion and subsequent loss of engine power.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
