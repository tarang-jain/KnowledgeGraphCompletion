Analysis   
The flight instructor stated that he and his student were on their fourth or fifth autorotation, 
and it looked as if they were going to overshoot the spot of intended landing, so they performed 
some "S" turns, and initiated a flare. He said during the flare the helicopter continued to 
descend, and it impacted the ground on the rear of the skids, severing the tail boom.

The flight crew's excessive descent rate during landing, resulting in a hard landing, and the tail 
boom being severed.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
