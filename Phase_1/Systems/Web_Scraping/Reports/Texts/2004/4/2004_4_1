Factual Information
On April 1, 2004, at 1830 eastern standard time, a Beech 1900D, N149CJ, operated by Colgan 
Air Inc., as U.S. Airways Express flight 4997, was substantially damaged when it collided with a 
fuel truck while taxiing at Bradley International Airport (BDL), Windsor Locks, Connecticut.  
The certificated airline transport pilot (captain), first officer, and 14 passengers were 
uninjured.  Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The 
flight was operating on an instrument flight rules flight plan between Syracuse Hancock 
International Airport (SYR), Syracuse, New York, and Windsor Locks.  The scheduled 
passenger flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 121.
According to a written statement provided by the captain, the flight landed on runway 24, and 
was cleared to taxi to the ramp.  As the airplane entered the ramp area, the flight crew planned 
to stop beyond the hold-short line, to wait for another airplane to exit gate 25.  As the flight 
crew crossed the hold-short line, and were almost at a complete stop, they felt a "buffet," which 
became a "large jolt," on the left side of the fuselage.  After realizing a fuel truck impacted the 
left engine and propeller, the captain shut down the engines, and evacuated the passengers 
from the right window emergency exit.
The captain stated that the taxi lights, flood lights, navigation lights, and beacon were 
illuminated while taxiing. 
The fuel truck driver reported in a written statement that he was traveling on the ramp from 
gate 11 to gate 25, to fuel the inbound Colgan Air flight.  As he was traveling within the "marked 
roadway," he suddenly observed a red light.  Realizing it was a wing light, he slammed on the 
brakes, and the airplane's engine impacted the right side of the truck cab.  
According to a written statement provided by a passenger, as the airplane was taxiing to the 
terminal, he looked to the left and noticed a fuel truck headed into the airplane's path.  The 
passenger stated that the fuel truck did not have any headlights or strobe lights illuminated, 
and estimated it was traveling about 15 mph.  The truck disappeared from view briefly, and 
then collided with the front left side of the airplane.  
A second aircraft refueler observed the accident fueling truck driving northbound on the ramp 
roadway.  The refueler did not observe any lights on the refueling truck.
Weather reported at BDL, at 1819, included winds from 020 degrees at 10 knots, 2 miles 
visibility, with light rain and mist.
The Bradley International Airport, Ramp Rules and Regulations, Section II, Vehicle 
Operations, stated in part: "All vehicles shall always relinquish right-of-way to any aircraft 
moving under its own power or under tow, except emergency conditions."  The regulations also 
stated that, "all vehicles will have lights on during the hours between dusk and dawn and 
during periods of low visibility."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
