Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
While on visual approach to the airport, the engine sputtered then lost power. The pilot's 
attempts to restore engine power were not successful. The pilot maneuvered the airplane to 
avoid trees, and it touched down on a grass fairway and nosed over. Examination of the 
airplane revealed 18 ounces of fuel was recovered from the right wing tank, and no fuel was 
recovered from the left wing tank. Four ounces of fuel was recovered from the fuel supply line 
to the carburetor, and the carburetor bowl contained no fuel. No evidence of fuel system 
leakage or defects were observed. Examination of the engine revealed no evidence of 
malfunction. Per STC SA4428SW, the airplane was equipped with a Lycoming O-360-A4M, 
180-horsepower engine. The airplane accumulated 3.7 hours on the hobbs meter during the 
flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate in-flight planning/decision, which resulted in fuel exhaustion.  The 
pilot's preflight planning and uneven terrain were contributing factors.

Factual Information
On April 2, 2004, at 1550 eastern standard time, a Cessna 172N, N271EP, registered to a 
private owner and operated by Avion Air Academy, collided with ground and nosed over 
following a loss of engine power during approach to Columbia Metropolitan Airport, Columbia, 
South Carolina. The personal flight was operated under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91 
with an instrument flight rules (IFR) plan filed. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed. 
The commercial pilot was not injured, and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The 
flight departed Orlando Sanford Airport, Sanford, Florida, at 1223 on April 2, 2004.
According to air traffic control records, the flight received its IFR clearance at 1214 and was 
cleared to taxi for takeoff from Orlando Sanford Airport at 1217. After takeoff at 1223, the flight 
was cleared to climb to 5,000 feet, and, at 1240, it was instructed to climb and maintain 7,000 
feet. At 1354, the flight climbed to 9,000 feet. At 1517, the pilot requested a descent to avoid 
icing conditions, and a controller cleared the flight to descend to 7,000 feet. At 1522, the pilot 
requested a descent and was cleared to 5,000 feet. While in contact with Columbia Approach 
Control, the flight was cleared at 1532 to descend to 3,000 feet, and, at 1542, the controller 
advised the flight to maintain maximum forward airspeed, and the flight was handed off to the 
Columbia Metropolitan tower controller.
The pilot stated he was cleared for a visual approach to runway 29; according to air traffic 
control records, the clearance was issued at 1545. The pilot stated the engine began sputtering 
and did not respond when full throttle was applied. The pilot stated he notified the tower 
controller of the problem and began looking for a field for landing. During the descent, the 
engine regained power briefly. As the pilot continued toward the airport, the engine lost power 
again, and the pilot's attempts to restore engine power were not successful. The pilot stated he 
completed the emergency procedures and established a glide toward a golf course. As the 
airplane neared the ground, the pilot maneuvered the airplane to avoid trees. The airplane 
touched down on a grass fairway and nosed over. 
Examination of the airplane revealed it came to rest upside down with damage to the landing 
gear, propeller, wings, and wing spar. Eighteen ounces of fuel was recovered from the right 
wing tank, and no fuel was recovered from the left wing tank. Four ounces of fuel was 
recovered from the fuel supply line to the carburetor, and the carburetor bowl contained no 
fuel. No evidence of fuel system leakage or defects were observed.
On April 23, 2004, the airplane was further examined at a recovery facility. The engine was 
provided an external fuel source, and the airplane's existing power supply and propeller were 
utilized. The cockpit controls for the engine were utilized, and the engine was observed to start 
and operate smoothly with the oil pressure within the green range on the gauge. Damage to the 
propeller precluded  a full throttle test; engine rpm was limited to 2000 rpm for the safety of 
personnel. A magneto check was performed with a 100 rpm drop observed for each. 
Application of carburetor heat using the cockpit control produced a drop in engine rpm. No 
evidence of engine malfunction was observed.  
A binder on board the airplane contained a Cessna Pilot's Operating Handbook for the 1978 
Skyhawk Model 172N that listed the airplane's fuel capacity as 43 gallons with 40 gallons total 
usable fuel. Additional documents in the binder revealed the Cessna 172N was modified in 
1989 with a Lycoming O-360-A4M, 180-horsepower engine under the provisions of 
Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) SA4428SW. The binder contained a copy of the STC and 
Page 4 of 6ATL04LA088
the "FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual Supplement" containing the amended weight and 
balance and engine performance information. 
According to the Flight Manual Supplement's performance table, fuel consumption for cruise 
flight at 72 percent brake horsepower at 10,000 feet was listed as 9.6 gallons per hour. Fuel 
consumption during cruise at 76 percent brake horsepower at 6,000 and 8,000 feet was listed 
as 10.1 gallons per hour. Fuel consumption during cruise flight at 76 percent brake horsepower 
at 2,000 and 4,000 feet was listed as 10.2 gallons per hour.
The dispatch log for the airplane recorded the hobbs meter and tachometer hours at the time of 
departure as 3611.4 and 848.3, respectively. The hobbs meter reading and tachometer reading 
on the airplane at the accident site were 3615.1 and 851.7, respectively. 
A review of published forecast winds aloft data for April 2, 2004, valid from 1300 to 1700 
eastern daylight time, revealed wind forecasts for the route of flight were as follows: 
Melbourne, Florida, at 3,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) winds from 290 degrees at 15 knots; at 
6000 feet MSL winds from 290 degrees at 25 knots; and at 9000 feet MSL winds from 290 
degrees at 31 knots. Savannah, Georgia, at 3000 feet MSL winds from 290 degrees at 28 knots; 
at 6000 feet MSL winds from 310 degrees at 30 knots; and at 9000 feet winds from 300 
degrees at 29 knots. Columbia, South Carolina, at 3000 feet MSL winds from 300 degrees at 
20 knots; at 6000 feet MSL winds from 320 degrees at 25 knots; and at 9000 feet MSL winds 
from 300 degrees at 32 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
