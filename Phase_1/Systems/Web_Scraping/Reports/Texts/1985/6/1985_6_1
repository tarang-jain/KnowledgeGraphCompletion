Analysis 
SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF, THE PLT DISCOVERED THAT THE ELEVATOR CONTROLS 
WERE JAMMED & PITCH CHANGES COULD ONLY BE MADE WITH ELEVATOR TRIM & 
POWER. AN EMERG LANDING WAS MADE USING THE TRIM, BUT THE PLT WAS 
UNABLE TO FLARE THE ACFT AT LANDING SPEED. THE ACFT STRUCK THE RWY WITH 
THE NOSE GEAR, BREAKING THE NOSE GEAR OFF. A POST-ACCIDENT EXAM 
REVEALED THAT AN AUTOPILOT ADAPTER FLANGE (RECENTLY INSTALLED TO THE 
BACK OF THE PILOT'S ATTITUDE INDICATOR) WAS IN A POSITION TO CATCH THE 
ELEVATOR SECONDARY STOP ON THE PILOT'S CONTROL COLUMN. THE ELEVATOR 
CONTROL COULD HAVE BEEN FORCIBLY FREED, BUT IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A 
LARGE FORCE TO DO SO.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
