Analysis 
DURING A BANNER TOWING MISSION, THE ACFT WAS OBSERVED FLYING AT LOW 
ALT NEAR CALIFORNIA STATE FREEWAY 91. ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, THE 
BANNER COLLIDED WITH POWER LINES AFTER THE ACFT HAD CROSSED OVER THE 
LINES AT A RELATIVELY SLOW SPEED. THE BANNER & TOW CABLE/ROPE RELEASED 
FROM THE ACFT & THE BANNER CAME TO REST ON THE POWER LINES. WITNESSES 
REPORTED THAT WHEN THE BANNER HIT THE POWER LINES, THE ACFT'S FORWARD 
MOVEMENT APPEARED TO STOP, THEN THE ACFT DROPPED OFF TO ITS LEFT & 
DESCENDED INTO THE PATH OF AN ONCOMING TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK. THE 
ACFT HAD NEARLY RECOVERED FROM THE DESCENT WHEN IT IMPACTED THE 
FREEWAY. THE DRIVER OF THE TRACTOR-TRAILER & HIS WIFE EXITED THE LEFT 
SIDE OF THE VEHICLE WITHOUT INJURY; HOWEVER, THEIR SON, WHO EXITED THE 
RIGHT SIDE DURING THE EVACUATION, RECEIVED MINOR INJURIES. THE ACFT & 
TRACTOR WERE DESTROYED BY IMPACT & FIRE. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A 
MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION WITH THE ACFT OR TOWING EQUIPMENT PRIOR TO 
THE COLLISION WITH THE POWER LINES.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
