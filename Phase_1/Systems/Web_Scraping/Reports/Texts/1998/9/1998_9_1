Analysis 
The pilot reported he was attempting to takeoff from a remote, off-airport site.  He estimated 
his takeoff site to be 500 feet long.  He related that the airplane became airborne after 
approximately  300 feet of ground roll, but soon settled to the ground, and drifted to the left 
into undergrowth.  The airplane subsequently encountered rough terrain, and nosed over.  The 
pilot noted there were no preimpact mechanical problems with the airplane. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's selection of an unsuitable area for takeoff.  A factor associated with the accident is 
the pilot's premature liftoff.

Factual Information
 On September 1, 1998, about 0900, a wheel equipped Piper PA-18-150 airplane, N7279K, 
sustained substantial damage when it collided with terrain during an attempted takeoff from a 
remote, off airport site located about 22 miles northwest of Anchorage, Alaska.  The solo 
private pilot was not injured.  The local, 14 CFR Part 91 flight operated in visual meteorological 
conditions without a flight plan.  The intended destination was Lake Hood Airstrip, Anchorage.
The pilot reported he had flown to the accident site the day before to hunt ducks.  He said he 
was utilizing an unimproved site about 500 feet in length for takeoff and landing.  On the 
accident takeoff, he indicated he was attempting to takeoff to the north, and he estimated the 
wind to be from the east about 6 to 8 mph.  During the takeoff roll, the airplane became 
airborne after about 300 feet, but soon settled to the ground, drifted to the left, and went into 
the adjacent undergrowth.  The airplane subsequently encountered rough terrain, and nosed 
over.
The pilot reported there was no preimpact mechanical problems with the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
