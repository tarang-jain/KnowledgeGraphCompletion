Analysis 
According to the pilot, he entered a left downwind for runway 36.  He touched down hard on 
the first landing, and the airplane bounced into the air.  The pilot then pulled back on the 
controls, and the airplane sank, collided with the runway, and bounced a second time.  The 
nose gear collapsed, and the propeller struck the ground on the second bounce. The airplane 
touched down for a third time and veered off the left side of the runway. According to the FAA, 
the airplane had wing damage and cracked engine mounts.  The inspector stated the airplane 
made too steep of an approach which led him to begin bouncing down the runway.  The pilot 
had 37 hours of total flying time. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper flare that resulted in a hard landing and porpoise, and his improper 
recovery from the bounced landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
