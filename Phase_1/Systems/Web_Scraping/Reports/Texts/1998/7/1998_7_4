Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
BAY CITY, MI
Accident Number:
CHI98LA231
Date & Time:
07/01/1998, 1520 EDT 
Registration:
N159MK
Aircraft:
KERR STARTDUSTER TOO
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported the airplane swerved and skidded sideways off the runway during the 
landing roll.  The airplane traveled onto a taxiway where it contacted a 3 to 4 inch rise between 
the grass and the pavement.  The right main landing gear collapsed then the rise was 
contacted.  The pilot/builder reported the loss of directional control was a result of an under 
inflated tailwheel.  He reported it should have been inflated to 38 psi due to the extra weight of 
having a passenger on board. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to assure the tailwheel tire had adequate pressure which resulted in his 
inability to maintain directional control of the airplane during a landing.  Factors associated 
with the accident were the inadequate pressure and the uneven terrain contacted by the 
landing gear.

Factual Information
 On July 1, 1998, at 1520 eastern daylight time, a Starduster Too, N159MK, operated by a 
private pilot experienced a right main gear collapse while landing at the Bay City Clements 
Municipal Airport, Bay City, Michigan.  The pilot and passenger were not injured.  The airplane 
was substantially damaged.  The 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight was operating in visual 
meteorological conditions.  The flight originated from the Bay City Clements Municipal Airport 
at 1415 eastern daylight time.
The pilot reported that upon landing he lost directional control of the airplane.  He stated the 
airplane swerved on the runway, then skidded sideways off the side of the runway.  The 
airplane then traveled onto a taxiway where it contacted a 3 to 4 inch rise between the grass 
and the pavement.  The right main landing gear collapsed then the rise was contacted.  The 
pilot/builder reported the loss of directional control was a result of an under inflated tailwheel.  
He reported it should have been inflated to 38 psi due to the extra weight of having a passenger 
on board.
Inspection of the airplane by an Inspector from the Federal Aviation Administration Grand 
Rapids, Michigan, Flight Standards District Office revealed the right main landing gear 
separated at the attachment weld.  When the right main gear collapsed the lower right wing 
contacted the terrain.  This resulted in a failure of the right lower wing rear spar.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
