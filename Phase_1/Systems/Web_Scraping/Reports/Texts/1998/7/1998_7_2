07/01/1998, 1545 AKD 
Registration:
N456TA
Aircraft:
Cessna 206G
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The certificated commercial pilot was landing on a remote gravel runway.  During a telephone 
conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge, on July 1, 
1998, the pilot reported that while landing to the west, he inadvertently flew further down the 
runway and landed about midfield of the 1,150 feet long runway.  He stated that after 
touchdown he was unable to stop the airplane before it went down an embankment at the end 
of the runway, and nosed over.  In his written statement to the NTSB dated September 1, 1998, 
the pilot reported that while landing to the west, he encountered an unexpected 'wind change' 
from the east.  He said that the tailwind caused the airplane's ground speed to accelerate, and 
after touchdown, he was unable to stop prior to reaching the runway end. The airplane's left 
wing sustained substantial damage. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to attain a proper touchdown point during landing.  A factor associated with 
the accident is the presence of a variable wind condition, and the pilot's decision not to 
perform a go-around.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
