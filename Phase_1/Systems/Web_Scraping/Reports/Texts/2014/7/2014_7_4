Location:
Hysham, MT
Accident Number:
WPR14CA277
Date & Time:
07/01/2014, 1000 MDT 
Registration:
N39761
Aircraft:
JONES HATZ CB1
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that after returning back from an approximate 45-minute local flight, he 
aligned the tailwheel equipped bi-plane for a landing on the active runway. The pilot noted 
there was an approximate 10-knot crosswind. During the landing roll, the airplane veered right 
and continued off the runway surface. The airplane ground looped which resulted in the 
collapse of the landing gear. As a result of the impact, the airplane incurred substantial damage 
to the wings. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll with a crosswind, 
which resulted in a ground loop.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Crosswind - Effect on operation

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
