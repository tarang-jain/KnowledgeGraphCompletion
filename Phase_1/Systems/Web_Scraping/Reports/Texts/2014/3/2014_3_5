Analysis   
The pilot reported that he had just landed his tail wheel-equipped airplane on a frozen lake. 
During the taxi to his cabin, both of the airplane's main landing gear wheels broke through 
overflow ice, and the airplane nosed over, sustaining substantial damage to the fuselage. The 
pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical anomalies with the airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation, and that the accident could have been prevented had 
he called a local lodge owner to check the conditions of the ice before landing.

The pilot's failure to determine that the ice that he was taxiing on was safe for operation.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=88872
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
