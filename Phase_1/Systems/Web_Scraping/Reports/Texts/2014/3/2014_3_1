Location:
Adrian, TX
Accident Number:
CEN14CA157
Date & Time:
03/01/2014, 1330 CST 
Registration:
N85372
Aircraft:
AERONCA 7AC
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported he planned on making a wheel landing at a higher than normal airspeed due 
to the anticipated strong surface wind. The pilot reported that during the landing roll, after the 
tailwheel settled to the ground, he noticed that the wind velocity was less than he anticipated 
and that his ground speed was "pretty fast." According to the pilot, due to the increased 
groundspeed, the wings were still producing some lift and although the gear remained on the 
runway, the full weight of the airplane was not on the landing gear. The pilot stated the 
airplane swerved to the right and he was able to regain directional control. The airplane then 
swerved to the left and the pilot was not able to regain directional control which resulted in a 
ground loop. The tailwheel traveled into the grass alongside the runway, and the right wing and 
right stabilizer contacted the ground. The pilot was able to taxi the airplane back onto the 
runway, however; he stated it would not taxi straight. The pilot reported there were no 
mechanical malfunctions of the airplane prior to the accident. A postaccident examination 
revealed the airplane sustained substantial damage to the aft fuselage.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during the landing roll which 
resulted in the airplane ground looping.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Surface speed/braking - Not attained/maintained

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
