Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Oshkosh, WI
Accident Number:
CEN14LA401
Date & Time:
08/01/2014, 1415 CDT 
Registration:
CF-HEZ
Aircraft:
MOSQUITO XE
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Part(s) separation from AC
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
Just after takeoff, the experimental, amateur-built helicopter started to rotate and then 
impacted the ground in a level attitude, which resulted in substantial damage to the helicopter. 
Examination revealed that one tail rotor blade had separated from the tail rotor and gearbox 
assembly and that the blade had separated cleanly from the assembly; neither the collar nor the 
pins used to secure the blade were located. The pilot reported that he had been testing this tail 
rotor design for 4 years. A tension/torsion strap and two steel pins were used to retain the 
blade. The strap was not completely restricted from movement, and, over time, movement and 
wear resulted in the failure of the retaining assembly. The tail rotor assembly was a unique 
design and was not used in any other application.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the retaining assembly on the tail rotor blade, which resulted in the separation of 
the blade and the subsequent loss of helicopter control.

Factual Information
On August 1, 2014, about 1415 central daylight time, a Mosquito XE amateur-built helicopter, 
Canadian-registered CF-HEZ was substantially damaged while maneuvering near Wittman 
Regional Airport (KOSH), Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The private pilot was not injured. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight. The helicopter was owned and operated by a 
private individual under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 without a 
flight plan. The local flight departed approximately 1410.
Just after takeoff, one tail rotor blade separated from the tail rotor and gearbox assembly. The 
helicopter started to rotate and impacted the ground in a level attitude, spreading both skids 
out horizontally. Both skids and the tail boom were substantially damaged.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration inspector who examined the helicopter, the 
tail rotor blade had separated cleanly from the assembly. Neither the collar nor the pins used to 
secure the blade were located. The inspector reported that the tail rotor assembly was a unique 
design being tested and was not used in any other application.
The pilot reported that he had been testing this tail rotor design for four years. He stated that a 
tension/torsion strap and two steel pins were used to retain the blade. The pilot stated that the 
strap was not completely restricted from movement and over time movement and wear 
resulted in the failure of the retaining assembly. The pilot reported that there were 82 hours on 
the tail rotor assembly and it had been 6 hours since it was last inspected.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
