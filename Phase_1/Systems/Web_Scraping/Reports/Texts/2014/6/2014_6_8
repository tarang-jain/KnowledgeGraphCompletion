Registration:
N30820

CESSNA 177B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that he had intended to perform a touch-and-go landing in to the wind; 
however, traffic was landing and departing in the opposite direction on the 5,760-foot-long, 
100-foot-wide, asphalt runway. The pilot then listened to the automated surface observation 
system, which indicated the wind was variable and he elected to land in the direction of the 
other traffic. During short final approach, the pilot noticed his airspeed was about 10 mph 
faster than normal and the airplane bounced after touchdown. The pilot added power to 
cushion the second bounce and the airplane began to drift left toward the left side of the 
runway. Before he could correct for the drift, the airplane bounced a second time. The pilot 
then added full power to perform a go-around, but the airplane struck a runway sign off the left 
side of the runway and came to rest upright in a grass area between the runway and taxiway. 
The pilot further stated that winds were light and variable and that there were no preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions with the airplane. Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation 
Administration inspector revealed damage to the firewall and horizontal stabilizer. The 
recorded wind at the airport, about 30 minutes before and after the accident, was a right 
crosswind at 6 knots with a 10-degree tailwind component.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during a go-around after landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
