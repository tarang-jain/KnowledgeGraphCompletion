Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that during the landing and rollout, the airplane was going faster than he 
wanted at his normal turnoff point on the runway so he continued to the next turnoff. While 
turning, he applied the brakes, raised the flaps, and pushed in the carburetor heat control. At 
that time, he realized that the airplane was not stopping so he applied more braking, but the 
airplane did not slow down or stop. Before he could move his feet higher onto the toe brakes, 
the airplane departed the runway surface onto bumpy ground, headed over a bank, and nosed 
over. The wings, vertical stabilizer and rudder were substantially damaged. The pilot reported 
no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded 
normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper application of brakes during the landing roll resulted in a runway 
excursion and nose over.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
