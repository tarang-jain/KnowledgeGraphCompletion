Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Positioning
Analysis   
The pilot reported that he decided to land at an en route airport to obtain fuel due to a stronger 
headwind than what was forecast for his route of flight. The pilot made a normal landing to the 
north and turned west off the runway onto the first taxi. He then made another turn to the 
north on the taxiway that paralleled the runway. As he taxied beyond a row of trees that were to 
the west, the upwind wing of the airplane lifted and the airplane flipped inverted. The rudder 
and left front wing strut were substantially damaged. The pilot stated he was using proper 
crosswind taxi technique, but was unable to keep the wing down. The wind conditions recorded 
at an airport located 37 miles away from the airport where the accident occurred were from 
290 degrees at 16 knots gusting to 25 knots. The pilot reported the local wind condition at the 
time of the accident was similar.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inability to control the airplane while taxiing due to a strong crosswind condition.
Findings
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
High wind - Ability to respond/compensate (Cause)
Crosswind - Ability to respond/compensate (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
