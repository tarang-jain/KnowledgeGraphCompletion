Analysis 
DURING ARRIVAL, THE PLT WAS CLEARED FOR A LOC/DME RWY 15 APCH TO THE 
UKIAH ARPT. AT 1307 PDT, HE BEGAN THE APCH AT THE TUCCI INTERSECTION, 15.5 
MI NORTH OF THE RWY. AT 1311:04 THE LAST RADAR CONTACT SHOWED THAT THE 
ACFT WAS ABOUT 5 MI NORTH OF THE ARPT. AT 1313, THE UKIAH FSS PERSONNEL 
REQUESTED THE ACFT'S POSITION & THE PLT REPORTED THAT HE WAS 5.5 MI ON 
THE DME (5.5 MI NORTH OF THE ARPT). THERE WERE NO FURTHER 
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE ACFT. SUBSEQUENTLY, IT CRASHED ON RISING 
MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN ABOUT 4 MI SOUTH OF THE ARPT AT AN ELEVATION OF 200 
FT. AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE DME WAS SELECTED TO THE #2 NAV 
RECEIVER WHICH WAS TUNED TO THE UKIAH VOR, LOCATED ABOUT 6 MI SOUTH-
SOUTHEAST OF THE ARPT. FOR THE APCH, THE DME SHOULD HAVE BEEN SELECTED 
ON THE #1 NAV RECEIVER WHICH WAS TUNED TO THE LOC/DME AT THE ARPT. THE

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
