Location:
SOLANA BEACH, CA
Accident Number:
LAX91FA020
Date & Time:
11/01/1990, 0745 PST 
Registration:
N9956L
Aircraft:
GRUMMAN AA-1B
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Aerial Observation
Analysis 
THE AIRCRAFT WAS LOADED OVER GROSS WEIGHT WITH A CG OUTSIDE THE REAR 
ENVELOPE LIMIT. THE PIC AND REPORTER PROCEEDED TO THE SITE OF AN AUTO 
ACCIDENT. EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE FACT THAT THE REPORTER, WHO WAS 
CURRENTLY RECEIVING DUAL INSTRUCTION AND HELD AN EXPIRED STUDENT 
PILOT CERTIFICATE, WAS FLYING THE AIRCRAFT. THE AIRCRAFT VIOLATED 
COMPANY MINIMUM ALTITUDE LIMITS BY DESCENDING TO ABOUT 800 FT AGL AND 
INITIATED A SERIES OF STEEP TURNS AT SLOW AIRSPEED. STATEMENTS FROM 
OTHER PILOTS ESTABLISHED THAT THE REPORTER LIKED TO CROSS CONTROL THE 
AIRCRAFT IN ORDER TO HAVE A BETTER VIEW OF THE GROUND. GROUND 
WITNESSES OBSERVED THE AIRCRAFT PERFORM AN ABRUPT MANEUVER THEN SPIN 
TO THE GROUND. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE INADVERTENT STALL/SPIN. FACTORS IN THE ACCIDENT WERE: THE PILOT'S 
DECISION TO ALLOW THE REPORTER PASSENGER TO FLY THE AIRCRAFT IN A 
CRITICAL FLIGHT SITUATION, HIS DECISION TO ALLOW THE AIRCRAFT TO DESCEND 
TO AN ALTITUDE TOO LOW TO ALLOW FOR CONTINGENCIES, AND THE FAILURE OF 
THE PILOT IN COMMAND TO ENSURE THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS PROPERLY LOADED.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
