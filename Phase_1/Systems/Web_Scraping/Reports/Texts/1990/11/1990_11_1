Analysis 
THE TWO PASSENGERS REPORTED THAT THEY HEARD A 'POP' SOUND, FOLLOWED BY 
THE HELICOPTER STARTING A CLOCKWISE SPIN TO THE RIGHT. THE HELICOPTER 
DESCENDED INTO THE TREES ON THE SIDE OF A STEEP SLOPE. INVESTIGATION 
REVEALED THAT THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT FAILED IMMEDIATELY FORWARD 
OF THE TAILBOOM EXTENSION TUBE. THE DRIVE SHAFT FAILED FROM FATIGUE 
CRACKING, PROPAGATING AT A HIGH RATE, SUGGESTING HIGH LOADS. THE T/R 
DRIVE SHAFT FORWARD BEARING HOUSING OUTER DIAMETER DIMENSION AND 
THE INNER DIAMETER OF THE TAILBOOM EXTENSION TUBE WERE WORN BEYOND 
REPLACEMENT LIMITS AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED ACCORDING TO THE 
BELL MAINTENANCE AND OVERHAUL MANUAL. THE PASSENGER THREE-PLACE 
BENCH SEAT HAD BEEN ALTERED SO THAT THE INDIVIDUAL SEAT BELTS HAD BEEN 
MODIFIED INTO ONE SINGLE LONG BELT. THE BELT COULD BE OPENED ONLY ON 
THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BELT; THE BUCKLE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BELT WAS 
TAPED CLOSED WITH SILVER DUCT TAPE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE ACCIDENT WAS INADEQUATE MAINTENANCE OF THE HELICOPTER, ALLOWING 
A TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT BEARING TO EXCEED WEAR LIMITS. THIS RESULTED IN 
HIGH LOADS ON THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT, AND THE RESULTING FATIGUE 
FAILURE OF THE DRIVE SHAFT.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
