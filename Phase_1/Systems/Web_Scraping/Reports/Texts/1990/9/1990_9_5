Analysis 
DURING NORMAL CRUISE FLT, THE PLT REPORTED THAT THE RPM WAS 
DECREASING & THE OIL TEMPERATURE WAS INCREASING. THE ENG THEN SEIZED. 
WITH POOR FWD VISIBILITY DUE TO OIL COVERING THE WINDSCREEN, HE 
OVERSHOT THE FIELD HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO LAND IN. THE ACFT COLLIDED WITH 
A FENCE THEN NOSED OVER. EXAM OF THE ENG REVEALED THAT THE NUMBER 3 
CYLINDER CONNECTING ROD END CAP SEPARATED, EXISTED THE CASE & CAME TO 
REST IN THE OIL SUMP. LYCOMING ENG PERSONNEL STATED THAT THE SEPARATION 
OF THE ROD CAP WAS DUE TO A LACK OF LUBRICATION WHICH CAUSED THE ROD 
BOLTS TO STRETCH, LOSING THEIR TORQUE, & ONE OF THE TWO NUTS VIBRATED 
OFF. THE OTHER ROD BOLT FAILED DUE TO OVERLOAD. THE ENG RECEIVED A TOP 
OVERHAUL 136 HRS EARLIER & A MAJOR OVERHAUL WAS PERFORMED 2,122 HRS 
EARLIER. NO DETERMINATION COULD BE MADE AS TO THE REASON FOR THE LACK 
OF LUBRICATION. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
ENGINE FAILURE DUE TO LACK OF OIL SUPPLY TO THE NUMBER 3 CYLINDER 
CONNECTING ROD FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS. THIS ALLOWED THE 
CONNECTING ROD END CAP TO SEPARATE THROUGH THE CASE RESULTING IN OIL 
EXHAUSTION.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
