Location:
HAMMOND, LA
Accident Number:
FTW90LA049
Date & Time:
01/04/1990, 0335 CST 
Registration:
N3531S
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172E
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE STUDENT PILOT RECEIVED TWO WEATHER BRIEFINGS DURING WHICH HE WAS 
TOLD AT FIRST THAT HIS ROUTE OF FLIGHT WAS MARGINAL VFR AND LATER THAT 
IT HAD GONE IFR. IN BOTH CASES, HE WAS TOLD THAT VFR WAS NOT 
RECOMMENDED. IN A POST-ACCIDENT INTERVIEW THE PILOT STATED THAT 
MARGINAL WEATHER DID NOT BOTHER HIM AND THAT HE KNEW 'HOW TO FLY IN 
THE CLOUDS'. ABOUT 2:10 AFTER DEPARTURE, THE PILOT CONTACTED NEW 
ORLEANS APPROACH CONTROL AND REQUESTED ASSISTANCE IN GETTING TO HIS 
DESTINATION AIRPORT. HE WAS TOLD THAT ALL OF THE AIRPORTS IN THE AREA 
WERE IFR. DURING THE NEXT 1:38 CONTROLLER ATTEMPTED TO VECTOR THE PILOT 
TO AIRPORTS IN THE AREA IN ATTEMPTS TO GET THE AIRPLANE DOWN. ANOTHER 
AIRPLANE ASSISTED IN THESE EFFORTS, BUT IN EACH CASE, THE PILOT WAS 
UNABLE TO LOCATE THE AIRPORTS DUE TO THE THICK UNDERCAST CONDITIONS. 
WHILE BEING VECTORED FOR AN ILS, THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HIS ENGINE QUIT 
DUE TO FUEL EXHAUSTION. HE WAS UNABLE TO GLIDE TO THE AIRPORT AND 
CRASHED INTO TREES ABOUT 8 MILES SHORT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
PILOT IN COMMAND'S INITIATION AND CONTINUATION OF THE FLIGHT INTO AN 
AREA OF KNOWN IMC WEATHER CONDITIONS AND HIS SUBSEQUENT INABILITY TO 
LAND PRIOR TO RUNNING OUT OF FUEL. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE 
ACCIDENT WERE THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO EXERCISE GOOD JUDGEMENT AND HIS 
DISREGARD FOR THE FEDERAL AIR REGULATIONS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
