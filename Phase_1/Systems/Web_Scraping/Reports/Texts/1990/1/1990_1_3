THE STUDENT PILOT EXPERIENCED A POWER LOSS ON TAKEOFF AT 500 FEET AND

DEGREES F. HOWEVER THE FAA REPORTED THE DEWPOINT WAS NOT 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AIRPORT WHICH IS TYPICALLY MORE HUMID DUE TO THE 
CLOSE PROXIMITY OF PONDS AND STREAMS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
