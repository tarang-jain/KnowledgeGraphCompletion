Analysis 
DURING FLT, THE PLT NOTED A DROP IN MANIFOLD PRESSURE & DECIDED TO MAKE 
A PRECAUTIONARY LANDING. WHILE ON A BASE LEG TO LAND, HEAVY SMOKE & 
FUMES FILLED THE CABIN & REQUIRED THE PLT TO LOOK OUT THE SIDE VENT 
WINDOW TO COMPLETE THE LANDING. AFTER THE AIRCRAFT STOPPED ON THE 
RUNWAY, A FIRE IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT WAS EXTINGUISHED. AN EXAM 
REVEALED THAT THE LEFT INTERMEDIATE EXHAUST PIPE (LYCOMING PART NO: 
LW-15811) HAD PARTIALLY SEPARATED AT THE FLANGE. THE ENGINE CROSSOVER 
EXHAUST ASSEMBLY HAD BEEN MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AD 89-12-04 & 
TEXTRON LYCOMING SERVICE BULLETIN #484, WHICH WERE INTENDED TO 
PREVENT THIS KIND OF FAILURE/SEPARATION. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
IMPROPER INSTALLATION BY MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL AND FATIGUE FAILURE 
AND LEAKAGE OF THE LEFT INTERMEDIATE EXHAUST PIPE, WHICH RESULTED IN 
AN IN-FLIGHT FIRE IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 
WERE: INADEQUATE SERVICE BULLETIN PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER AND

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
