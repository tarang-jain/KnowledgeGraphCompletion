Analysis 
THE COMMUTER AIR CARRIER CAPTAIN'S LAST SCHEDULED FLIGHT HAD 
TERMINATED IN SACRAMENTO ON 3/31. HE INFORMED HIS CARRIER THAT HE 
WOULD LIKE TO BE LOCATED IN THE LOS ANGELES OR SANTA BARBARA AREA BY 4/1. 
THEY OFFERED THE AIRPLANE WHICH NEEDED TO BE REPOSITIONED TO SANTA 
BARBARA. HE HAD NEVER PILOTED THE AIRPLANE SOLO, BUT DID NOT WANT TO 
WAIT FOR A CO-PILOT. THE PILOT STATED HE CLIMBED TO 17,500 FT, TRIMMED THE 
AIRPLANE FOR CRUISE FLIGHT, AND 'DOZED OFF' SEVERAL TIMES. WHEN HE LAST 
AWOKE THE AIRPLANE WAS DESCENDING AT OVER 300 KTS (VNE IS 246 KTS). HE 
WAS ONLY ABLE TO RECOVER USING ELECTRIC TRIM. THE UPPER WING SKIN PANEL 
DAMAGE WAS LATER OBSERVED BY A PASSENGER ON A SUBSEQUENT FLIGHT. 
ACCORDING TO THE AIRPLANE'S MANUFACTURER, THE AIRPLANE WOULD HAVE 
HAD TO EXPERIENCE A CALCULATED LOAD FACTOR OF 7.8 G'S TO SUSTAIN THE 
OBSERVED DAMAGE TO THE WING SKIN PANELS, STRINGERS AND MAIN SPARS. THE 
PILOT STATED HE HAD ONLY SLEPT 1-1/2 TO 2 HRS DURING THE PRECEDING 24-HR 
PERIOD. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S POOR JUDGMENT IN ATTEMPTING A FLIGHT WHILE BEING FATIGUED 
DUE TO THE LACK OF SLEEP WHICH RESULTED IN A LOSS OF CONTROL AND 
SUBSEQUENT OVERSTRESSING OF THE AIRPLANE.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
