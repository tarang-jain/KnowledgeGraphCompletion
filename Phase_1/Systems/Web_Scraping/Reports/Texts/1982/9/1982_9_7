THE RIGHT MAIN GEAR "IN TRANSIT" LIGHT REMAINED ON AFTER GEAR 
RETRACTION ON A TRAINING FLIGHT. VARIOUS METHODS OF REMEDIAL ACTION 
DID NOT CURE THE PROBLEM. A LANDING ON RUNWAY 21 WAS EXECUTED WITH 
THE NOSE AND LEFT MAIN GEAR IN THE DOWN POSITION. THE RIGHT GEAR 
REMAINED IN TRANSIT. DIRECTIONAL CONTROL WAS MAINTAINED NEARLY 
THROUGHOUT THE LANDING ROLL. PRIOR TO THIS FLIGHT, COMPANY 
MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL HAD INSPECTED THE GEAR IN COMPLIANCE WITH A 
TELEGRAPHIC MESSAGE FROM THE MANUFACTURER. THE INSPECTION WAS 
INITIATED BY ONE MAINTENANCE SHIFT AND COMPLETED BY ANOTHER.

JAMMED PREVENTING COMPLETE EXTENSION OF THE GEAR.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
