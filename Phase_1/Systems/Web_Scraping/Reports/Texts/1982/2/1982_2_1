Analysis 
BEFORE THE AIRCRAFT ARRIVED, THE SNOW COVERED RUNWAY WAS PLOWED. A 
CESSNA 182 PILOT PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THE BRAKING ACTION AS FAIR TO POOR. 
THE AIRCREW DECIDED TO LAND AS CLOSE TO THE APPROACH END AS POSSIBLE. 
THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ADVISED BY NOTAM, TOWER, OR 
FBO OF A SNOWBANK WHICH WAS AT THE THRESHOLD. HE STATED THAT THE 
GROUND WAS WHITE FROM SNOW AND THAT THE SNOWBANK WAS NOT 
DISTINGUISHABLE. BOTH MAIN GEAR WENT THROUGH THE SNOWBANK. THE LEFT 
GEAR FAILED WHICH ALLOWED THE LEFT WING TO SETTLE TO THE GROUND AS THE 
LANDING CONTINUED.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
