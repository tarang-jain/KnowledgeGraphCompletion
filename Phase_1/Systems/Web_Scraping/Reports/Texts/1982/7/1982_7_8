Analysis 
WHEN THE PILOT ARRIVED IN THE VICINITY OF HIS DESTINATION, HE LOWERED 
THE GEAR AND FLAPS AND DLEW OVER AN OIL RIG. HE DID THIS TO ALERT 
SOMEONE ON THE GROUND TO PICK HIM UP AT THE DESTINATION. AS HE APPLIED 
POWER TO PROCEED TO THE AIRPORT, THE LEFT ENGINE DID NOT RESPOND. HE 
REPORTED THAT THE ENGINE ACTED LIKE THE FUEL HAD BEEN CUT OFF. HE SAW A 
ROAD AHEAD AND ELECTED TO LAND AS HE WAS AFRAID THE OTHER ENGINE 
WOULD LOOSE POWER. DURING THE LANDING, THE LEFT TIP TANK STRUCK A TREE. 
THE AIRCRAFT THEN VEERED INTO A DITCH AND THE NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED. THE 
PILOT STATED THAT HE DID NOT SERVICE THE PLANE BEFORE TAKEOFF. HE 
ESTIMATED THAT 50 GALLONS WAS ON BOARD DURING DEPARTURE. THE ONE 
HOUR AND 25 MINUTE FLIGHT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED ABOUT 280 LBS OF FUEL. 
THE PILOT REPORTED NO MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION OR FAILURE.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
