Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Jacksonville, FL
Accident Number:
MIA02LA122
Date & Time:
07/01/2002, 1120 EDT 
Registration:
N1693A
Aircraft:
Piper PA-22-20
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The student pilot/owner of the accident airplane said he possesses a solo endorsement to 
operate the airplane, and that there was a flight instructor with him in the airplane who had 
not yet received a tail wheel endorsement to operate the airplane. He said the touch-and-go 
landing had been uneventful, but during takeoff the airplane began to "weather vane", so he 
retarded the throttle control to idle and applied left rudder control input in an attempt to 
maintain control, but the airplane veered off the runway, hitting a runway light, and then 
swung around incurring substantial damage. The flight instructor seated next to pilot/owner 
stated that when the airplane started to veer off the runway he also applied rudder control 
input but the airplane continued toward the right edge of the runway and within 5 to 8 seconds 
swung  through an arc of 180 degrees and he was unable to maintain directional control. Both 
occupants of the airplane said that prior to the accident there had been no failure or 
malfunction to the airplane or any of its systems.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the solo student/owner to maintain directional control of the airplane during 
takeoff in a crosswind, which resulted in the airplane veering off the runway, a collision with a 
runway light, and a ground loop.

Factual Information
On July 1, 2002, about 1120, eastern daylight time, a Piper PA-22-20, N1693A, registered to 
and operated by a private individual as a Title 14 CFR Part 91 training flight, crashed during 
takeoff at Cecil Field, Jacksonville, Florida. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no 
flight plan was filed. The airplane incurred substantial damage, and the student-rated pilot and 
a commercial-rated flight instructor received no injuries. The flight originated from Herlong 
Airport, Jacksonville, Florida, the same day, about 1114.
The student pilot/owner stated that he possesses a current solo endorsement to operate the 
accident airplane, and that a flight instructor who had never received a tail wheel endorsement 
was with him in the airplane when the accident occurred. He further stated that he had 
performed a touch-and-go landing which had been uneventful, and as he was taking off, the 
airplane initially tracked along the centerline of the runway, but as it accelerated to about 45 or 
50 knots it began to "weather vane"  toward the right edge of the runway. He said he retarded 
the throttle to idle and applied left rudder control input, but rudder effectiveness was reduced 
and the airplane continued to veer to the right, where it collided with a runway edge light, 
swung around, and incurred damage to the left wing, left elevator, and horizontal stabilizer.
The flight instructor said that he also tried to apply rudder control input when the airplane 
started to veer from the centerline of the runway, but that the aircraft turned through an arc of 
180 degrees within about 5 to 8 seconds, and his attempts to maintain directional control were 
unsuccessful. 
Both occupants of the accident airplane said that prior to the accident there had been no 
mechanical failure or malfunction to the airplane or to any of its systems.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
