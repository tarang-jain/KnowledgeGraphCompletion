Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
St. Johns, AZ
Accident Number:
LAX02LA245
Date & Time:
08/01/2002, 0735 MST 
Registration:
N2233D
Aircraft:
Cessna 170B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot attempted to make a three-point touchdown with a known crosswind and the 
airplane ground looped, veered off the runway, and collided with an airport boundary fence.  
Just after touchdown on runway 14, a ground loop commenced, and the airplane veered to the 
right.  Left brake and rudder were applied in order to regain control, whereupon the airplane 
ran off the east side of the runway.  The pilot decided to abort the landing and applied full 
power in an attempt to get the airplane airborne and under control, but the left wingtip 
contacted the ground.  The airplane then struck a fence, impacted the ground, nosed over, and 
came to rest inverted.  The  automated surface observation system (ASOS) was reporting winds 
from 240 at 11 knots about 20 minutes after the accident.  Runway 21 was available at the 
airport for the landing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's selection of the wrong runway for the existing crosswind condition and his 
subsequent inadequate compensation for the winds, which led to a failure to maintain 
directional control and a ground loop.

Factual Information
On August 1, 2002, at 0735 mountain standard time, a Cessna 170B, N2233D, ground looped 
off the runway, hit a fence, and nosed over, while landing at St. Johns Industrial Air Park 
(SJN), St. Johns, Arizona.  The airplane was owned and operated by the pilot under the 
provisions of 14 CFR Part 91.  The private pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured; the airplane 
sustained substantial damage.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan 
had been filed for the local area personal flight that originated about 0700.
The pilot indicated that he was the last of a group of five aircraft to arrive at St. Johns and 
chose to land on runway 14, as the other members in the group had done.  He was aware that a 
crosswind, "light and from the southwest," was present.  Upon the attempted three-point 
touchdown, the airplane ground looped to the right.  Left brake and rudder were applied, and 
the airplane veered off the east side of the runway.  Noticing that the terrain dropped away on 
that side of the runway, the pilot added power and removed carburetor heat, in order to fly 
toward the lowering terrain and regain control of the airplane.  However, the left wing tip made 
contact with soft terrain and the airplane struck a chain link fence while in flight.  As a result, 
the airplane struck the ground nose first, and nosed over.  The airplane came to rest inverted 
about 100 feet from the runway.  
The  automated surface observation system (ASOS) for St. Johns was reporting winds from 240 
at 11 knots at 0754.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
