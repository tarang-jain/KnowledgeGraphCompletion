Registration:
N9623C
Aircraft:
Piper PA-28-161
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The 11-hour student pilot reported that this was his first supervised solo, and that the first two 
touch-and-go landing were "normal."  On his third approach to a full-stop landing to runway 
17, airspeed was approximately 62 knots and the visual approach slope indicator indicated the 
airplane was too low.  The pilot increased power to get back on his approach path, but passing 
the numbers for runway 17 he noticed he was about 20 feet high and the nose of the airplane 
seemed a little high.  After the pilot lowered the nose the airplane touched down hard and 
began skidding to the left.  The pilot attempted to regain control of the airplane, but 
overcorrected by intermittently applying brakes.  The airplane traveled off the runway at 
approximately a 90 degree angle, coming to rest in an upright position in a culvert.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control.  A factor was the inadequate flare.

Factual Information
On October 2, 2002, approximately 1850 central daylight time, a Piper PA-28-161 single-
engine airplane, N9623C, was substantially damaged following a loss of directional control 
while landing at the University of Oklahoma Westheimer Airport, Norman, Oklahoma.  The 
airplane was owned and operated by the University of Oklahoma.  The student pilot, sole 
occupant of the airplane, was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no 
flight plan was filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.  The 
local flight originated from the Westheimer Airport, at 1840.
According to the Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB Form 6120.1/2) the 11-hour 
student pilot reported that this was his first supervised solo flight, and that his first two touch-
and-go landings were "normal."  The student pilot stated that on his third approach to runway 
17, the airspeed was approximately 62 knots, and the visual approach slope indicator (VASI) 
was indicating that the airplane was too low.  "To gain altitude I increased power, which put me 
back on path."  The pilot reported that after passing the numbers on runway 17 he was about 
20 feet high and noticed that the nose of the airplane seemed a little high.  He then pitched the 
nose down to keep from "floating."  After touching down "hard" the airplane began skidding to 
the left.  The pilot stated that he attempted to regain directional control of the airplane with the 
rudder pedals, but "apparently overcorrected."  The pilot reported that he was intermittently 
applying brakes, but was already off the runway moving toward a culvert.  The pilot further 
stated that he continued to try to gain directional control of the airplane, but was never able to 
fully recover control.  After coming to rest upright in a shallow culvert, the pilot placed the 
mixture control to idle-cutoff and exited the airplane.
Maintenance personnel who worked for the University reported that the left wing and left main 
landing gear were damaged, both propeller blades were bent, and the lower part of the firewall 
sustained structural damage.
At 1854, the University of Oklahoma Automatic Weather Observing System reported sky clear, 
visibility 10 statute miles, wind 140 degrees at 9 knots, temperature 84 degrees F, dew point 72 
degrees F, and an altimeter of 29.92 inches of Mercury.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
