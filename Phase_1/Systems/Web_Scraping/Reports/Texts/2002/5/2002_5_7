The pilot was performing a crosswind landing to runway 1.  The pilot reported that the airplane

propeller, nose landing gear, and the firewall.  The pilot did not report any mechanical 
problems with the airplane.  Winds reported at the airport about the time of the accident were 
from 350 degrees at 15 knots, with 20 knot gusts.
Probable Cause and Findings

The pilot's improper flare and his improper recovery from a bounced landing, which resulted in 
a hard landing.  A factor in this accident was the crosswind condition.

Factual Information
On May 1, 2002, about 1325 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 182Q, N4468N, was substantially 
damaged while landing at the Teterboro Airport (TEB), Teterboro, New Jersey.  The 
certificated private pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no 
flight plan had been filed for the personal flight conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
The pilot was landing on runway 1, a 7,000-foot long, 150-foot wide, asphalt runway.  In a 
written statement, the pilot said he experienced a strong crosswind, which required a "very 
distinct left-hand crab."  The airplane landed hard, veered to the right, and began to bounce.  
The pilot described the bounces as "hard;" however, the airplane came to rest on the runway, 
and he taxied to a parking area. 
Examination of the airplane by a  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed 
damage to the propeller, nose landing gear, and the firewall.
The pilot did not report any mechanical problems with the airplane.
The pilot reported 220 hours of total flight experience, which included about 9 hours in make 
and model. 
Winds reported at TEB, at 1351, were from 350 degrees at 15 knots, with 20 knot gusts.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
