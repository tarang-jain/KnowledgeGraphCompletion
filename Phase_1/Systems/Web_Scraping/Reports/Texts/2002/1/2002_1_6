Factual Information
On January 3, 2002, at 1600 eastern standard time, an Aeronca 11AC, N302AC, owned and 
piloted by a private pilot, was substantially damaged during touchdown on runway 18 (1,800 
feet by 300 feet, snow) at a private airstrip called Krieger's Farm Strip located near Lake 
Leelanau, Michigan.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  
The 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight was not operating on a flight plan.  The pilot reported no 
injuries.  The local flight originated from Krieger's Farm Strip at 1430.
The pilot reported that the ski equipped airplane flipped over when its right ski dug into the 
dirt upon touchdown on the 8-inch soft snow covered runway.   He added that there were no 
mechanical problems with the airplane. 
The pilot reported that the accident could have been prevented by "[being] more cautious when 
on skis and earth is not frozen and snow is not hard because of warm temperatures."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
