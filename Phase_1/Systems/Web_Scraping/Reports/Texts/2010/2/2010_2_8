Location:
Amarillo, TX
Accident Number:
CEN10LA117
Date & Time:
02/04/2010, 0215 CST 
Registration:
N644EM
Aircraft:
MITSUBISHI MU-2B-60
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
4 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Non-scheduled
Analysis 
While on approach to the snow and ice-covered runway, the pilot was correcting for a right 
crosswind.  The airplane was flying approximately 20 knots faster than the recommended 
landing airspeed.  The airplane's right main landing gear touched down first followed by the 
left main landing gear and the nose gear.  The airplane made an abrupt left turn and the pilot 
attempted to correct by depressing the right rudder pedal.  The pilot lost control of the airplane 
and the airplane departed the left side of the runway. The right main landing gear was torn 
from the airplane and the airplane came to rest in the upright position.  Airfield operations 
reported that the runway's braking condition was estimated at "nil."  An examination of the 
airplane and its systems revealed no anomalies.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of directional control while landing on an ice/snow covered runway.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Alertness/Fatigue - Pilot
Environmental issues
Snow/slush/ice covered surface - Effect on operation (Factor)

Factual Information
**This report was modified on April 23, 2010**
On February 4, 2010, approximately 0215 central standard time, a Mitsubishi MU-2B-60, 
N644EM, was substantially damaged during a runway excursion at the Rick Husband Amarillo 
International Airport (KAMA), Amarillo, Texas.  Night visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed at the time of the accident.  The on-demand air taxi flight was being conducted under 
the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 on an instrument flight rules 
flight plan.  The pilot and three passengers were not injured.  The cross-country flight 
originated from the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (KDFW), Fort Worth, Texas at 
0111 and was landing at its intended destination at the time of the accident.
According to a statement provided by the airline transport pilot, while on approach to the 
airport, the pilot was informed by airport operations that the runway was covered with snow 
and ice.  The pilot acknowledged and continued the instrument approach to the landing 
runway.  While on approached the pilot was correcting for a right crosswind.  The pilot kept a 
higher approach speed and landed 20 knots faster than the manufacturer's recommended 
landing airspeed.  The airplane's right main landing gear touched down first followed by the 
left main landing gear and the nose gear.  The airplane made an abrupt left turn and the pilot 
attempted to correct by depressing the right rudder pedal.  The pilot lost control of the airplane 
and the airplane departed the left side of the runway on a heading that was approximately 30 
degrees left of runway heading. The right main landing gear detached from the airplane and 
the airplane came to rest in the upright position.  
An inspector from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) responded to the accident scene 
and found no pre-impact anomalies with the airframe or engines.  Denting, bending, and 
crushing damage was sustained to fuselage and the forward spar of the right wing.  In an 
interview with the FAA inspector, a representative from airfield operations reported the 
runway's braking condition was estimated at "nil."
This accident is part of the Safety Board's Human Fatigue Investigation Methodology Study.  
Forms completed by the pilot indicate that he awoke at approximately 0700 on February 3, 
2010.  The pilot had been awake for 19 hours and 15 minutes prior to the accident, but had only 
been on-duty for 4 hours and 15 minutes.
At 0211, an aviation special weather report from KAMA's weather station reported winds from 
120 degrees at 6 knots, 1/2 miles visibility with a runway 04 visual range of 4,000 to 5,000 
feet, snow, freezing fog, an indefinite ceiling with a vertical visibility of 110 feet, temperature 28 
degrees Fahrenheit (F), dew point 28 F, and a barometric pressure of 29.91 inches of Mercury.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
