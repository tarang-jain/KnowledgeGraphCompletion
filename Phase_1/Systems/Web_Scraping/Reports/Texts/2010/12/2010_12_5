Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On December 1, 2010, about 1700 mountain standard time (MST), an experimental light-sport 
weight-shift-control Sabre Trike, N765MH, impacted terrain during an uncontrolled descent 
near Pleasant Valley Airport, Peoria, Arizona.  The owner/pilot was operating the airplane 
under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91.  The sport pilot was 
fatally injured; the trike sustained substantial damage to both wings and fuselage structure.  
The local personal instructional flight departed Peoria at an unknown time.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.
Witnesses near the airport saw the trike in a spiraling descent before losing sight of it. After a 
short search of the area, the accident site was located about 0.5 nm south of the airport.
A Federal Aviation Administration inspector from the Scottsdale Flight Standards District 
Office responded to the accident site.
The debris field, including the trike and all of the components and control surfaces, were 
within the immediate impact area. A 60-pound bag of dry ready cement was found in the front 
area of the trike wreckage. It was later discovered that the pilot was using the cement bag as a 
ballast to simulate a front seat passenger.
The accident site was documented, and the trike was recovered for further examination.
On December 2, 2010, the Maricopa County Medical Examiner conducted an autopsy on the 
pilot. The cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma of torso and extremities. The 
manner of death was by accident.
On December 8, 2010, investigators examined the wreckage at Air Transport, Inc., Phoenix, 
Arizona. The engine was examined; after minor adjustments the engine was started, and ran 
without issues.
Examination of the airframe revealed no abnormalities that would have precluded normal 
operations.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
