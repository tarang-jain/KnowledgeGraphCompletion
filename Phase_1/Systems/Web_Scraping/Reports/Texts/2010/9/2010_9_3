Analysis   
The pilot stated that he was conducting a sightseeing flight just prior to sunset when the 
balloon encountered updrafts. He elected to land in the back yard of a private residence and 
initiated a descent. He allowed the basket of the balloon to contact the top of the trees to slow 
down his forward momentum, in an effort to make the landing area. Upon clearing the trees, 
he observed powerlines in the vicinity and aborted the landing. The pilot immediately selected 
another backyard for his touchdown point. He observed another large tree and allowed the 
basket to contact the tree and the basket descended upright next to the tree. The canopy 
received a minor tear and one passenger sustained a fractured wrist during the landing.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=77184
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
