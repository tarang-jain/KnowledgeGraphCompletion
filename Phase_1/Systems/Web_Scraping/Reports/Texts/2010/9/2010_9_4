Registration:
N2156K
Aircraft:
LUSCOMBE 8A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot stated that the takeoff was normal until the airplane was about 50 feet above the 
ground, at which time he closed the carburetor heat and the engine lost power. The airplane™s 
landing gear then contacted top of a security fence beyond the end of the runway and the 
airplane bounced into a plowed field in a nose-down attitude. The pilot further stated that 
before he exited the airplane, he checked the fuel valve and found that it was not locked in the 
full forward position; rather, it was midway between the "ON" and "OFF" positions. The pilot 
said that in retrospect, he was not positive that he had placed the fuel valve in the "ON" 
position during his preflight inspection, and that this was the reason for the engine losing 
power on takeoff.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s failure to ensure that the fuel valve was in the "ON" position during his preflight 
inspection, resulting in the loss of engine power during takeoff.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
