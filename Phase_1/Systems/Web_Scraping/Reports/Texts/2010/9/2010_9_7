Analysis   
The pilot stated that he taxied to the runway for the purpose of performing a high speed taxi 
run. After an engine run-up, he latched the two canopy latches on the right side and scanned 
the instrument panel, noticing that the cylinder head temperature and oil temperature were 
rising. He stated that his attention was diverted in concern of the rising temperature and did 
not recall if he latched the two latches on the left side of the canopy. He started the takeoff roll 
and after becoming airborne, he noticed the canopy opening on the left side. The pilot 
attempted to latch the canopy, but realized it would take both hands, and continued to climb to 
pattern altitude while trimming the aircraft for better airspeed control. He then pulled the 
throttle back to slow the airspeed and attempted to latch the canopy. The canopy started 
flapping up and down, and when he tried to secure it shut with his hands he was not be able to 
control the airplane. He stated that debris was flying everywhere and the wind blew off his 
headset. When he realized that he was getting low he added full engine power and looked for a 
clear area; shortly thereafter the airplane collided with the ground.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s failure to properly latch the cockpit canopy prior to takeoff, resulting in his diverted 
attention and failure to maintain aircraft control.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
