Analysis   
While on a cross country flight the pilot recognized that he had been using the wrong road to 
navigate to his destination. He decided to turn around and return to the departure airport. The 
pilot reported that he was concerned with the approaching night and decreasing light 
condition. As the amount of light continued to decrease he elected to make a precautionary 
landing on a road prior to reaching the departure airport. The pilot stated that either during 
the landing or taxi the underside of the wing was damaged by contact with a road marker. 
Further damage to the wing caused by contacting additional road markers occurred when the 
pilot taxied off the road to park the airplane and again when repositioning the airplane. The 
pilot reported that there were no known mechanical malfunctions or failures with the aircraft 
prior to the accident.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=76555
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
