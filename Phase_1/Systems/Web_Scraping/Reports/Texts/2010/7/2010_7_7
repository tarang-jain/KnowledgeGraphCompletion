Registration:
N220WJ

CIRRUS DESIGN CORP SR22

Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that he was low on the final approach to runway 32 at the mountaintop 
airport, but thought he could "make the numbers." The airplane encountered a downdraft, and 
the pilot wasn't able to compensate for it. The airplane impacted terrain about 3 feet short of 
the runway, bounced, then veered off the right side of the runway and struck an embankment, 
resulting in substantial damage to the right wing and fuselage. The pilot also stated that there 
was a 7-knot tailwind "from the right," and that the density altitude was about 6,300 feet at the 
time of the accident. The flight was the pilot™s seventh arrival into the airport, and his first time 
landing there with a tailwind. There were no preaccident mechanical anomalies noted with the 
airplane, which "was performing great." According to the airport's pilot manual, runway 32 was 
the preferred landing runway due to its upslope and fewer obstructions at the arrival end. 
There was no displaced threshold, and the terrain rose sharply to the approach end of the 
runway. A visual glideslope indicator was located to the left of the runway. The pilot's manual 
also advised, "consider flying a steeper approach to compensate for the 'burble' downdraft 
typically present at the end of the runway," and noted that the hills on either side and the 
runway's upslope "will combine to produce the optical illusion of being too steep an approach 
path." The manual further stated, "consider carefully the effects of density altitude on the 
performance of your aircraft," as well as, "many pilots will not consider landing with SSE 
winds, and will simply divert" to another airport.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain a proper visual glideslope during final approach.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
