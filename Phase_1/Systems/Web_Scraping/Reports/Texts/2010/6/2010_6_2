Analysis   
The pilot reported that the airspeed indicator was not displaying normal values as the airplane 
accelerated on the takeoff roll.  After identifying the airspeed indicator anomaly, she continued 
the takeoff roll for an unspecified distance before ultimately deciding to abort the takeoff.  The 
pilot noted that there was an accumulation of dew on the grass runway.  During the rejected 
takeoff, the airplane overran the end of the runway and slid down an embankment before 
nosing-over in a ravine.  Both wings were substantially damaged during the accident.  A 
postaccident inspection revealed that the pilot had not removed the pitot-tube protective cover 
before departure.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s inadequate preflight inspection and delay in aborting the takeoff.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
