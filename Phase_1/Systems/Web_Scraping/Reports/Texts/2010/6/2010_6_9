Location:
Alturas, CA
Accident Number:
WPR10LA275
Date & Time:
06/01/2010, 1900 PDT 
Registration:
N354MB
Aircraft:
Airborne Windsports PTY LTD Edge 
X
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Sys/Comp malf/fail (non-power)
Injuries:
1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The certified flight instructor (CFI) and a student pilot were performing touch-and-go and full 
stop landings. The CFI reported that during the final landing roll at 30 miles per hour, the wing 
rolled severely to the left, and struck the ground. The wing crumpled, and dug into the surface 
rolling the airplane onto its left side. Postaccident examination revealed that the right rear 
mast support cable fractured about 3 inches above its lower attachment point where the cable 
enters a swedge. A Federal Aviation Administration inspector examined the wreckage and 
confirmed the break to the cable and also noted that there appeared to be some bluish green 
corrosion on the copper compression swedge.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Fracture of a mast support cable due to corrosion, which resulted in a loss of control during the 
landing roll.
Findings
Aircraft
Attach fittings (on wing) - Fatigue/wear/corrosion (Cause)
Directional control - Attain/maintain not possible

Factual Information
On June 1, 2010, about 1900 Pacific daylight time, an experimental Airborne Windsports PTY 
LTD Edge X, N354MB, collided with terrain during landing at Alturas, California. The student 
pilot/owner was operating the airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) Part 91. The student pilot sustained minor injuries, and the certified flight instructor 
(CFI) was not injured. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wing and wire support 
bracing. The local instructional flight departed Alturas about 1800. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.
The CFI stated that the student had been practicing touch-and-go landings, and this was to be 
a final full stop landing. The airplane touched down safely, and was rolling straight at 30 miles 
per hour. Suddenly and without warning, the wing rolled severely to the left, and struck the 
ground. The wing crumpled, and dug into the surface. The airplane rolled onto its left side, and 
skidded to a stop on the runway. The CFI then shut off the ignition, magnetos, and fuel valve.
The CFI indicated that post flight examination revealed that the right rear mast support cable 
snapped about 3 inches above its lower attachment point. This was at a point where the cable 
enters a swedge. The cable is covered by the manufacturer with an opaque plastic cover, similar 
to shrink tubing. He stated that they observed no discrepancies on the cables, welds, engine, 
wing, suspension, or other components during preflight. They had completed about 12 
landings during the day with no indications of a potential problem.
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector examined the wreckage, and observed that 
the right mast to landing gear support cable was broken at the copper compression swedge. 
There appeared to be some bluish green corrosion on the swedge.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
