Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis   
The pilot reported that the airplane encountered a downdraft after completing an aerial 
application pass. While climbing away from the field, the airplane™s right wing impacted a tree 
and the pilot performed an off-field landing instead of returning to the departure airport. The 
main landing gear collapsed during the landing in a rough field. A postimpact fire ensued on 
the right wing after the airplane came to rest. The airplane was substantially damaged. The 
pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would 
have precluded normal operation of the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from a tree during an aerial application flight.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=75636
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
