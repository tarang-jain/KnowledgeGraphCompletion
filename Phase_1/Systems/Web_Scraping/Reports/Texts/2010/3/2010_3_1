Location:
Gaithersburg, MD
Accident Number:
ERA10CA155
Date & Time:
03/01/2010, 1715 EST 
Registration:
N700ZR
Aircraft:
SOCATA TBM 700
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Runway excursion
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Business
Analysis   
The pilot of the single-engine turboprop was on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight and 
cancelled his IFR flight plan after being cleared for a visual approach to the destination airport. 
He flew a left traffic pattern for runway 32, a 4,202-foot-long, 75-foot-wide, asphalt runway. 
The pilot reported that the airplane crossed the runway threshold at 81 knots and touched 
down normally, with the stall warning horn sounding. The airplane subsequently drifted left 
and the pilot attempted to correct with right rudder input; however, the airplane continued to 
drift to the left side of the runway. The pilot then initiated a go-around and cognizant of risk of 
torque roll at low speeds did not apply full power. The airplane climbed to about 10 feet above 
the ground. At that time, the airplane was in a 20-degree left bank and the pilot applied full 
right aileron input to correct. The airplane then descended in a left turn, the pilot retarded the 
throttle, and braced for impact. A Federal Aviation Administration inspector reported that the 
airplane traveled about 100 feet off the left side of the runway, nosed down in mud, and came 
to rest in trees. Examination of the wreckage by the inspector did not reveal any preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions, nor did the pilot report any. The reported wind, about the time of the 
accident, was from 310 degrees at 10 knots, gusting to 15 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
