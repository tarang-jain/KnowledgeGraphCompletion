Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that he was landing the tailwheel-equipped airplane on a gravel-covered 
runway in a left crosswind. He stated that during touchdown he used insufficient rudder and 
the airplane veered to the left. He added power to correct the situation and abort the landing, 
but the airplane's right wing contacted trees and it pivoted to the right. The airplane continued 
to track right, exited the gravel runway, and came to rest at the base of an embankment. The 
airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing assembly and empennage. The pilot 
noted that there were no preimpact mechanical anomalies with the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the wind conditions during landing, which resulted in 
a loss of directional control and collision with trees.
Findings

Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
