Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The instrument-rated pilot was issued a clearance to descend to 4,000 feet for radar vectors to 
a nonprecision instrument approach in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). The last 1 
minute 23 seconds of radar data indicated the airplane leveled at 4,000 feet for about 35 
seconds and then varied between 3,800 feet and 3,900 feet for the remainder of the flight for 
which data was available. During this timeframe, the airspeed decreased from 131 knots to 57 
knots. Witnesses observed the airplane descending in a spin, and one reported hearing the 
engine running. Recorded engine data showed an increase in engine power near stall speed, 
which was likely the pilot's response to the low airspeed. The airplane damage was consistent 
with a low-speed impact with some rotation about the airplane's vertical axis. The pilot did not 
make any transmissions to air traffic control indicating any abnormalities or emergency. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies that would have precluded 
normal operation. During training on the accident airplane, the instructor recommended that 
the pilot get 25 to 50 hours of flight in visual meteorological conditions before flying in IMC in 
order to gain more familiarity with the radios, switches, and navigation equipment. The pilot 
only had 14 hours of flight time in the accident airplane before the accident flight, however it 
could not determined whether this played a role in the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s failure to maintain airspeed in instrument meteorological conditions, which 
resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
Findings
Aircraft
Airspeed - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Ceiling/visibility/precip - Effect on operation

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On May 2, 2010, about 2016 eastern daylight time (EDT), a JetProp DLX Piper PA-46-350P, 
N135CC, sustained substantial damage on impact with terrain near New Albany, Indiana. 
Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The private pilot 
and passenger were fatally injured. The 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight was operating on an 
instrument rules (IFR) flight plan. The flight departed from Barkley Regional Airport (PAH), 
Paducah, Kentucky, about 1836 central daylight time (CDT) and was en route to Bowman Field 
Airport (LOU), Louisville, Kentucky.
About 1800 CDT, an employee of a fixed base operator at PAH stated that he directed the 
parking of the airplane. The pilot requested 40 gallons of fuel per side. The employee did not 
see any leaks from the airplane, and the airplane looked to be in ﬁreal good shape.ﬂ 
About 1801-1805 CDT, the Washington Automated Flight Service Station, WS030 position, 
provided a weather briefing to a caller who had represented N135CC.  The caller requested to 
be provided with ﬁjust a metarﬂ at Louisville so he could see if he needed to go under visual 
flight rules (VFR) or IFR. When asked by the briefer if the caller was leaving soon, the caller 
said ﬁyes.ﬂ The conversation continued and WS030 stated:
ﬁuh looks like you™ll have to go i f r *(louisville™s) callin it wind one seventy at five nine miles 
light rain ceiling nine hundred broken one thousand one hundred overcast temperature an dew 
point both twenty one– however at standiford they have six miles moderate rain an mist uh 
one thousand three hundred broken an one thousand nine hundred overcastﬂ
The caller then filed an IFR flight plan with a ﬁfiled offﬂ time of ﬁtwenty minutes thirty 
minutes,ﬂ an altitude of ﬁtwo one zero,ﬂ direct to ﬁlouisville bowman,ﬂ and a time en route of 45 
minutes. The alternate airport was Louisville International Airport-Standiford Field (SDF), 
Louisville, Kentucky.
WS030 stated, ﬁan ya got the airmet sierra for i f r ceilings below a thousand visibilities below 
three precipitation an *(mist) an uh conditions are forecast to continue through o three 
hundred both for turbulence an the i f rﬂ
At 1826 CDT, N135CC requested an IFR clearance to LOU from PAH air traffic control. The 
clearance was, ﬁcleared to bowman airport at filed maintain three thousand expect flight level 
two one zero within one zero minutes–.ﬂ At 1833 CDT, N135CC was cleared for takeoff.
A transcription of transmissions by N135CC and Louisville/Standiford Air Traffic Control 
Tower, Departure One Radar, at the following times, states, in part:

There were no further recorded transmissions by N135CC.
A witness reported that the airplane approached from the southeast with a ﬁloudﬂ engine 
sound. The airplane then went ﬁupside downﬂ and entered a ﬁspiral nose-dive."  The witness 
also reported that there was no smoke or fire from the airplane.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
The pilot, age 59, held a private pilot certificate with airplane single-engine land, glider, and 
instrument airplane ratings. On November 13, 1986, he was issued a private pilot certificate 
with a glider rating. On January 28, 1994, he was issued an airplane single-engine land rating. 
On April 28, 1998, he was issued an instrument airplane rating.
According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, on March 13, 2007, the pilot was 
involved in a runway incursion at Tucson International Airport, Tucson, Arizona. The pilot 
received an air traffic control clearance to taxi to runway 11L, which he read back correctly. The 
pilot stated that although he read the clearance as given, he taxied onto runway 11L expecting 
an immediate takeoff as he was aware of and saw air traffic on final approach for the same 
runway. The pilot was piloting a PA-46, N870FS, at the time of the runway incursion.
On March 8, 2010, the pilot began JetProp Factory Training, which included 7 flights and 8.5 
hours of flight time in the accident airplane. 
The president of JetProp stated that most of its customers received 5-10 hours of flight 
training, the amount of which depends on their ability.  Most customers convert the airplane 
they have been flying so their panels are virtually the same. The pilot purchased an existing 
JetProp to train in, so the airplane and panel were new to him. The pilot was an average pilot 
with fairly good pilot skills, but he was always hunting around the panel for radios, switches, 
and navigation equipment. Because of this, it was recommended to the pilot that he should 
accumulate 25-50 hours under VFR before flying in instrument meteorological conditions 
without a safety pilot, to which the pilot agreed.
The JetProp Factory Training endorsement in the pilot's logbook was dated March 11, 2010. 
From March 12 to April 25, 2010, there were 5 entries logging flights of the accident airplane, 
of which only three entries had an associated flight time, which totaled 5.6 hours. 
Page 4 of 10CEN10FA233
The pilot's total flight time, based upon logbook entries, was about 2,493.7 hours, which 
included entries for a Piper PA-46, N870FS. 
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
The airplane was manufactured in 1999 as a Piper PA-46-350P, serial number 4636192, and 
was modified by Rocket Engineering Corp. under supplemental type certificate (STC) 
ST00541SE at a total time and Hobbs time of 354.8 hours, dated January 21, 2002. Under STC 
ST00541SE, the design change was for the installation of a Pratt & Whitney PT6A-34. The 
airplane was equipped with a Hartzell HC-E4N-3M, 4-blade composite propeller. Piper 
Aircraft had not provided any PA-46-350P engineering and/or flight test data to Rocket 
Engineering Corp. for its STC ST00541SE.
An Aircraft Registration Application by Deeems Holdings, LLC was signed by the pilot on 
March 8, 2010.
The airplane received its last annual inspection, dated May 21, 2009, at a Hobbs and total time 
of 1,396 hours. The engine received its last annual inspection, dated May 21, 2009, at a Hobbs 
time of 1,396 hours and a total time of 1,041.2 hours. According to aircraft and engine logbook 
entries, dated March 8, 2010, the Hobbs time was 1,388 hours.
A FlightSafety International JetProp DLX Pilot Training Manual recovered from the airplane 
states that the airspeed indicator green arc (normal operating range) is 68-172 knots indicated 
airspeed (KIAS) and the white arc (flaps down) is 57-117 KIAS.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The main wreckage was located 38 degrees 11 minutes 52 seconds North, 85 degrees 53 
minutes 13 seconds West at an elevation of 337 feet. The airplane was on a field in an upright 
position with a tail to nose heading of about 329 degrees. Ground scarring was limited to an 
approximate area surrounding the main wreckage, which consisted of the fuselage, wings, 
empennage, and engine. The area surrounding the main wreckage had a smell consistent with 
Page 5 of 10CEN10FA233
Jet A fuel.
The left wing and right wings were attached to the fuselage. The left wing tank was broken 
open and deformed outwards above and along the leading edge. The right wing was separated 
about mid-span and displaced aft. The right wing flap was attached to both right wing sections.
 
The empennage was separated from the fuselage near the aft pressure bulkhead. The vertical 
stabilizer was attached by its spar, and the remaining section of vertical stabilizer was 
displaced towards the right side of the fuselage as viewed from tail to nose. 
Flight control continuity from the control surfaces to the cockpit controls was confirmed.  The 
flaps, cockpit flap indicator, and handle were in the 10 degree extended position. The elevator 
trim jack screw was extended by about 10 threads, which equated to about 1/3 full nose-up 
trim.
The cockpit landing gear selector was in the down position. The landing gear was not in the 
retracted and locked position and when the airplane was lifted during recovery, the landing 
gear extended. 
The fuel selector was positioned to the left tank. There was usable fuel quantity in the right 
tank and an unusable fuel quantity in the left tank. A liquid consistent in the color and smell of 
Jet A was present in the engine driven fuel pump.
The cockpit ignition switch was in auto position. The generator switch was in on position. The 
fuel pump switch was in the pump 2 position.
The top and bottom sections of the cabin entry door had their handles in the latched position. 
The top section had its two engagement hooks extended.
A crew oxygen bottle was found within the cabin, and its gauge indication was above the green 
band labeled full.
The Hobbs meter was destroyed.
Three of the four propeller blades were separated from the shank. One propeller blade was 
intact and the other was recovered along a road adjacent to the accident site. The remaining 
two propeller blades were not located. The fracture surfaces and location of the three separated 
propeller blades was consistent with impact damage. All four of the propeller 
blades/counterweights were of a similar blade angle estimated to be between low pitch and 
feather positions. The mounting bolts and engine attachment were intact. There were no 
impact marks to indicate preimpact blade angle. There were no anomalies that would have 
precluded normal operation.
A disassembly examination of the engine, a PT6A-34, serial number RB0137, revealed impact 
damage to the external engine housing. There was no evidence of fire. The engine compressor 
turbine, power turbine guide vane ring, interstage baffle, power turbine shroud, and power 
turbine displayed circumferential scoring consistent with rotation at the time of impact. There 
were no preimpact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
The pilot was issued a third class airman medical certificate on March 31, 2010, with the 
following limitations: ﬁmust wear lenses for distant, have glasses for near visionﬂ.
Page 6 of 10CEN10FA233
An autopsy of the pilot was performed on May 3, 2010, and reported the cause of death was 
multiple blunt force injuries sustained in a small passenger aircraft mishap.
The FAA™s Final Forensic Toxicology Fatal Accident Report of the pilot stated: no carbon 
monoxide detected in blood, no cyanide detected in blood, no ethanol detected in blood, no 
drugs listed detected in blood.
TESTS AND RESEARCH
Autopilot Examination
The KFC 225 autopilot system underwent a component examination at Honeywell, Olathe, 
Kansas, under the supervision of the FAA. The components were: configuration module, flight 
control computer, pitch servo, primary servo (roll servo), and the servo mount (roll). 
The configuration module indicated that the software load was for a KFC 225 installation on a 
Piper PA-46-350P.  The module also recorded roll monitor fail and yaw fail errors about 51 
minutes and 36 seconds and 51 minutes and 38 seconds, respectively, after power was applied 
to the flight computer. The roll monitor fail message is logged when the aircraft experiences 
roll rates in excess of +/- 14 degrees per second or a roll attitude of +/- 45 degrees. The 
autopilot automatically disconnects when the roll monitor is tripped, which is logged as a roll 
monitor fail, and all of the flight director functions are disengaged. The yaw fail message is 
logged when the yaw rate is in excess of 12 degree per second. When yaw fail is logged, YD 
mode becomes inactive without affecting the other autopilot modes.
The flight control computer was connected to a system test panel and passed the preflight test. 
The unit passed all functional tests that included NAV/HDG/APR/VS mode engagement, 
altitude preselect, ARM, trim sense, auto trim, and course/heading operation.
The pitch servo sustained impact damage and portions of its bearing were damaged/not 
recovered. The inside of the pitch servo cover contained two markings consistent in color with 
that of the motor counterweight rubbing on the cover. In preparation for functional testing, the 
bearing was replaced and the motor counterweight was realigned. The servo then underwent 
final acceptance tests and no discrepancies were noted.
The primary servo (roll servo) was connected to a system test panel and passed preflight 
testing.  The clutch engagement and disengagement was satisfactory. The servo passed 
functional checks. No discrepancies were noted.
The servo mount (roll) clutch was tested in the clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. The 
clutch slipped at approximately 31 inch per pound in both directions. STC installation manual 
cites the limit for clutch slip at 22 +/-2 inches per pound.
Stall Computer Examination
The stall warning computer was examined at Safe Flight Instrument Corporation, White 
Plains, New York under the supervision of the FAA. The computer was tested to and passed the 
acceptance/functional test procedure (ATP) with a small tolerance variation which may have 
due to adjustment for aircraft specific capability. The lift transducer associated with the stall 
vane could not be tested due damage from recovery.
Engine Trend Monitor (ETM)
Engine trend monitor (ETM) data was downloaded at Shadin Avionics, St. Louis Park, 
Page 7 of 10CEN10FA233
Minnesota, under the supervision of the FAA. The ETM download recorded 16 records dated 
May 2, 2010. The record times were not correlated and the record of the last takeoff report 
recorded a time of 15:33:25. The last three records consisted of a power check, a shaft 
horsepower exceedance, and a torque exceedance. The power check report recorded:

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
