Analysis   
The private pilot, with one passenger, was on a Title 14, CFR Part 91, personal flight when the 
accident occurred. The purpose of the flight was to search for a missing friend in an area of 
remote tree and snow-covered terrain. The pilot said that while flying slow and maneuvering at 
75-feet above the ground, his passenger saw the missing man lying on the ground near a snow-
covered meadow. The pilot reported that as he started a right turn back to the meadow, he 
added engine power, and initiated a climb, but the right wing stalled. He said that he initiated a 
stall recovery, but that the airplane descended nose down into the trees. The pilot said that 
there were no mechanical problems with the airplane prior to the accident. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed while maneuvering, which resulted in an 
aerodynamic stall.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=75914
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
