Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot, who was flying the second airplane in a flight of two, was maneuvering in the traffic 
pattern at a remote back-country airstrip. The approach to the airstrip required the pilots to 
make a precise base leg to final turn between two steep rock cliffs. During the accident pilot's 
turn to final approach, he inadvertently made too wide of a turn, resulting in the airplane's 
nose and right main landing gear colliding with the cliff and becoming separated from the 
airframe. After the pilot in the other airplane confirmed the extent of the damage, the pilot 
flying the accident airplane maneuvered to a town where emergency personnel could be 
available on the ground. Due to the damage, the pilot decided to land in the grass/turf area 
alongside the main runway. During the landing roll, the nose gear strut dug into the soft terrain 
and the airplane nosed over onto its back.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from terrain during a turn onto the final approach leg 
of the traffic pattern.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Environmental issues
Soft surface - Contributed to outcome
Mountainous/hilly terrain - Response/compensation (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
