Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Park Rapids, MN
Accident Number:
CEN10CA461
Date & Time:
08/02/2010, 1730 CDT 
Registration:
N389HW
Aircraft:
Wing Kitfox II
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot noted a partial loss of engine power in the float-equipped airplane. His corrective 
actions did not restore full engine power and the airplane was unable to maintain altitude. He 
reduced engine power to flight idle and entered a rapid descent to a nearby lake. He noted that 
the engine continued to operate while in the flight idle position. Due to the size constraints of 
the lake, the landing was firm and that the airplane nosed over shortly after touchdown.  The 
fuselage primary structure, left horizontal stabilizer, right float and support structure, and left 
wing spar were substantially damaged during the accident.  A postaccident examination 
confirmed flight control continuity between the cockpit controls and the individual flight 
control surfaces.  Fuel system continuity was established between the fuel control and 
carburetor.  The examination did not reveal any evidence of a mechanical malfunction.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power for undetermined reasons and the pilot's failure to adequately 
flare during the water landing.
Findings
Aircraft
Engine (reciprocating) - Malfunction (Cause)
Landing flare - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Wheel/ski/float - Capability exceeded
Personnel issues

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
