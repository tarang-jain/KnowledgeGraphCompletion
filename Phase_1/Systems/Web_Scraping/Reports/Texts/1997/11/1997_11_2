Registration:
N96575
Aircraft:
Cessna 172P
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:

1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The student pilot had planned to practice stop-and-go landings on runway 34. He said the 
airplane touched down on all three wheels simultaneously, because he did not flare sufficiently. 
The left main and nose wheel came up, but instead of going around, he pushed the nose down. 
The airplane began to veer to the left, and the student corrected by applying right rudder. 
When the left main wheel contacted the runway, the airplane veered further to the left. The 
student applied additional right rudder retracted the flaps and added power to abort the 
landing. As the airplane departed the left side of the runway, the student closed the throttle 
and applied brakes. The left wing struck a 3,000-foot marker sign, and the airplane collided 
with a fence. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
failure of the pilot to maintain directional control of the airplane, while landing.  Factors 
related to the accident were: the pilot's improper flare for landing, his delay in attempting to go 
around (abort the landing), and the encounter with a runway marker and a fence.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
