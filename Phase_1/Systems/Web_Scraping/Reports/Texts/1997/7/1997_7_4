Factual Information
 On July 1, 1997, at 1600 hours mountain standard time, a Piper PA-18-150, N7764D, ground 
looped and collapsed one main landing gear while taxiing at the Page, Arizona, airport.  The 
aircraft sustained substantial damage and the commercial pilot and his passenger were not 
injured.  The airplane was operated by the pilot as a personal cross-country flight under 14 CFR 
Part 91 when the accident occurred.  The flight originated at Hurricane, Utah, on the day of the 
accident at an unknown time.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the 
accident and no flight plan was filed.
The pilot reported that he was drifting left toward the runway turnoff following a successful 
landing on runway 33.  The winds were reported from 040 at 8 knots, with occasional gusts to 
12 knots.  As the aircraft neared the turnoff, it suddenly and sharply ground looped to the right.  
During the ground loop, the left main landing gear collapsed.
The aircraft was moved to Spanish Fork Flying Service in Flying Fork, Utah, for repairs.  The 
aircraft was inspected at the request of the NTSB by an Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
inspector from the Salt Lake City Flight Standards District Office.  According to the FAA 
inspector, no evidence of fatigue or corrosion were noted visually.  The airplane was equipped 
with oversize tundra tires.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
