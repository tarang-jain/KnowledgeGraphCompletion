Part 91: General Aviation -
Analysis 
After lowering the landing gear the pilot confirmed that it was down and locked while on final 
approach.  After touchdown during the landing roll, the nose landing gear collapsed.  Post 
incident trouble shooting of the hydraulic system revealed that the landing gear hydraulic 
selector valve failed to hold pressure resulting in the collapse of the nose landing gear. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
the partial failure of a component of the hydraulic system resulting in the collapse of the nose 
landing gear during the landing roll.
Findings

Factual Information
 On October 1, 1997, about 1615 eastern daylight time, a Grumman G-73, N168WS, registered 
to Pantechnicon Aviation Ltd., experienced a collapse of the nose landing gear during the 
landing roll at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for the 14 
CFR Part 91 type-rating flight.  The airplane sustained minor damage and the airline-transport 
rated type rating applicant/pilot, second pilot, and an FAA operations inspector were not 
injured.  The flight originated about 1215 from the same airport.
     The pilot-in-command stated that the gear operated normally during the flight which 
included several gear extensions and retractions.  While on final approach, the landing gear 
indicator indicated that the gear was down which was confirmed once after landing gear 
extension, and again on short final.  After touchdown during the landing roll at an indicated 
airspeed of about 40 knots, the nose landing gear collapsed.
     Post incident trouble shooting of the hydraulic system revealed that the landing gear 
hydraulic selector valve failed to hold pressure resulting in the collapse of the nose landing 
gear.  Pressure testing of the valve revealed that a poppet valve part number 27580, was 
bypassing fluid.  The O-rings were replaced and the poppet valve continued to bypass fluid.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
