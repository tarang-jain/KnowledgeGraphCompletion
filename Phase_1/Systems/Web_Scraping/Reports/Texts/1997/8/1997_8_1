Factual Information
 On August 1, 1997, about 2200 Alaska daylight time, a Cessna 170B tail wheel equipped 
airplane, N3491C, sustained substantial damage when it impacted water during an attempted 
takeoff from a beach on Seymour Canal, about 22 miles southeast of Juneau, Alaska, at 
position 58-00.0 north latitude, 134-20.0 west longitude.  The private certificated pilot was 
uninjured.  The flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91 in visual meteorological conditions 
as a personal flight.  Lighting conditions were evening twilight.
The pilot stated to the NTSB investigator that he began his takeoff from hard, wet sand with an 
estimated 800 feet of takeoff length available.  When he saw the water become visible in the 
landing light, he applied flaps to become airborne, but did not have sufficient airspeed to fly.  
The airplane's right wing contacted the water, and the airplane came to rest approximately 200 
feet from the shoreline, in approximately three feet of water.  The pilot waded to shore, and 
was picked up by a passing aircraft about 1000 on August 2, 1997.
The pilot stated that he weighs 180 pounds, and that there was 90 pounds of fuel on board.  
The passenger seats had all been removed, and there was a thirty pound pack and a ten pound 
rifle on board.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
