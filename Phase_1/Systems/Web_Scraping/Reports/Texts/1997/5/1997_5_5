Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was departing in a tailwheel equipped airplane on runway 36. He reported that 
during the takeoff roll, there was a left crosswind that varied from a headwind to a tailwind, 
and the tail of the airplane began to swing to the right. The airplane ground looped to the left, 
and ran off the left edge of the runway. The right main landing gear strut collapsed, and the 
right wing struck the ground. The airplane came to rest partially up on its nose and received 
damage to the right landing gear attach point, the right wing, and propeller. At 1550, an 
Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR) at Talkeetna reported the wind was from 245 
degrees at 10 kts. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions and failure to maintain directional 
control of the airplane.  A factor associated with the accident was: the variable crosswind 
condition.

Factual Information
 On May 2, 1997, at 1554 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Cessna 180, N74806, crashed 
during takeoff at the Talkeetna Airport, Talkeetna, Alaska.  The airplane was being operated as 
a visual flight rules (VFR) local area personal flight when the accident occurred.  The airplane, 
operated by the pilot, sustained substantial damage.  The certificated private pilot, and two 
passengers, were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
On May 2, 1997, at 1710, the pilot reported in a telephone conversation with the National 
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC), that he was departing 
runway 36 at Talkeetna.  A crosswind from the left varied from a headwind to a tailwind.  
During the takeoff roll, the tail of the airplane began to swing to the right and a gust of wind 
lifted the left wing.  The airplane ground looped to the left and the airplane ran off the left edge 
of the runway.  The right main landing gear strut collapsed and the right wing struck the 
ground.  The airplane came to rest partially up on its nose and received damage to the right 
landing gear attach point, the right wing, and propeller.
At 1550, an Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR) at Talkeetna was reporting in part:  
Wind, 245 degrees (magnetic) at 10 knots; visibility, 60 statute miles; clouds, 4,000 feet 
scattered, 20,000 feet broken; temperature, 55 degrees F; dew point, 29 degrees F; altimeter, 
29.96 inHg.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
