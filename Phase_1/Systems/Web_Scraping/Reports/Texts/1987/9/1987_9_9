Flight Conducted Under:
Part 121: Air Carrier - Scheduled
Analysis 
SMOKE DETECTED IN THE CABIN RESULTED IN AN EVACUATION OF THE AIRCRAFT 
JUST AFTER BEING PUSHED BACK FROM THE JET-WAY. SUBSEQUENT 
INVESTIGATION ESTABLISHED THAT A MALFUNCTIONING PACK VALVE HAD CAUSED 
THE AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM TO OVERHEAT CAUSING THE SMOKE. THE 
EMERGENCY SLIDE AT DOOR 2R INFLATED PARTIALLY INSIDE THE ACFT AND WAS 
NOT USABLE. AT THE TIME OF INITIAL INVESTIGATION THE SLIDE TRAY DOOR FROM 
2R WAS FOUND LYING ON THE FLOOR INSIDE THE ACFT. EXITS 1L, 2L, 4L, 4R AND 
FOUR OVER WING EXITS WERE USED (THE CAPT HAD LOWERED THE FLAPS TO FULL 
DOWN FOR THE EVACUATION). IT WAS DETERMINED DURING INVESTIGATION THAT 
THE DOOR WAS NOT OPENED FULLY ENOUGH FOR EXIT 2R TO OPERATE PROPERLY. 
UAL MODIFIED THE TRAINING TO EMPHASIZE THE DOOR OPENING PROCEDURE. 
THE FA SAID SHE PULLED THE (MANUAL INFLATION) HANDLE ON 2R.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
