Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE PILOT REPORTED THAT AFTER TOUCHING DOWN HE FELT THE AIRCRAFT 
BOUNCE SLIGHTLY. HE RECOVERED FROM THE BOUNCE AND CONTINUED THE 
LANDING. DURING ROLLOUT, THE PILOT NOTED THAT THE AIRCRAFT BEGAN TO 
LIST EXCESSIVELY TOWARD ITS LEFT SIDE. IN SPITE OF HIS CONTROL INPUTS, THE 
AIRCRAFT CONTINUED TO LIST UNTIL THE LEFT WING FINALLY CONTACTED THE 
RUNWAY. AN INSPECTION OF THE AIRCRAFT REVEALED THAT THE LEFT MAIN 
LANDING GEAR ATTACHMENT BRACKET HAD SEPARATED IN THE AREA OF THE 
WELD. A STEREO MICROSCOPE EXAMINATION OF THE FRACTURE SURFACES 
REVEALED A LACK OF WELD FUSION. THE AIRCRAFT WAS MANUFACTURED IN 
JANUARY 1995 AND HAD ACCRUED A TOTAL OF 71.9 HOURS FLIGHT TIME WITH NO 
REPORTED PRIOR DAMAGE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the failure and collapse of the left main landing gear due to a defective and improper weld by 
the manufacturer. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: MAIN GEAR COLLAPSED
Phase of Operation: LANDING - ROLL
Findings
1. (C) LANDING GEAR,MAIN GEAR ATTACHMENT - SEPARATION
2. (C) INSTALLATION - IMPROPER - MANUFACTURER

Factual Information
 On April 1, 1995, at 1450 Pacific standard time, an American Champion 8KCAB, N111LS, 
sustained substantial damage while making a wheel landing at Long Beach, California.  The 
aircraft was operated by Hart Air Squadron Jg 54 and was on a local flight.  Visual 
meteorological conditions were prevalent at the time and no flight plan had been filed.  Neither 
the certificated private pilot nor his passenger were injured.  The flight originated from the 
Long Beach airport at 1400 on the day of the accident.
The pilot reported that he had been cleared to land on runway 25R and was prepared to 
execute a wheel landing.  After initially touching down at 85 mph, he felt the aircraft bounce 
slightly then drift right of the runway centerline.  He recovered from the bounce and realigned 
the aircraft with the runway.  When he again touched down, he lowered his left wing slightly to 
compensate for the left crosswind.  
During rollout, the pilot noticed that the aircraft began to list excessively toward its left side.  
He attempted to correct the condition by applying right aileron, but lost control effectiveness 
as the aircraft slowed.  The aircraft continued to list until the left wing contacted the runway.  
As the left gear collapsed, the aircraft veered right, coming to a stop near midfield and off the 
right side of the runway.
The postaccident inspection of the aircraft revealed that the left main landing gear attachment 
bracket of the aircraft had separated in the area of the weld.  The separated weld section was 
sent to the National Transportation Safety Board Materials Laboratory Division for inspection.  
A stereo microscope examination of the fractures revealed a lack of weld fusion.  The aircraft 
was manufactured in January of 1995 and had accrued 71 total hours of operation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
