NOSED DOWN. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

Factual Information
 On April 1, 1995, at 1315 eastern standard time, an Aeronca Champ 7AC, N85713, was 
substantially damaged during landing roll on runway 06 at the Lakewood Airport, Lakewood, 
New Jersey.  The pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  The local 
flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
The pilot reported that the purpose of the flight was to practice takeoffs and landings at the 
Lakewood Airport.  He stated that after touchdown during the landing roll the wind shifted 180 
degrees and the airplane "...veered violently to the left causing me to hit right rudder and brake 
and put stick to left as far as possible."  The pilot stated the airplane continued off the runway 
into soft sand and nosed down.  He stated the airplane's right wing and propeller were 
damaged.
The pilot also noted that minutes after the accident the airport closed and then reopened with 
the active runway changed from runway 06 to 24.
No airframe or engine anomalies were reported.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
