Factual Information
 On November 2, 1995, about 2048 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-28R-210T, N3306Q, 
registered to a private owner, operating as a 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight, landed gear up  at 
the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport. The airplane sustained substantial damage. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the local flight. The private 
pilot and one passenger reported no injuries. The flight originated from the Fort Lauderdale 
Executive Airport, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, about 48 minutes before the accident.
     The pilot stated he lowered the landing gear and verified that he had three green lights. He 
touched down on the right main landing gear and the landing gear collapsed.
     Maintenance personnel from Banyan Air Service responded to the crash site to recover 
N3306Q. Examination of the airplane revealed the airplane was resting on the outside 
sidewalls of the main landing gear, and on the nose section. The nose gear doors were in the 
closed position. The airplane was jacked up and the landing gear emergency extension lever 
was engaged. The landing gear extended to the locked position. Further examination of the 
landing gear system  by the FAA and Banyan Air Service maintenance personnel revealed 
scrape marks present on the outside surfaces of the nose gear landing gear doors. Examination 
of the left and right main landing gear tires revealed the outside sidewalls of both tires were 
scuffed. There was no damage to the left or right wing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
