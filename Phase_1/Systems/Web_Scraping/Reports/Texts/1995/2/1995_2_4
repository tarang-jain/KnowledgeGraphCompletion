Factual Information
 On February 1, 1995, at 1545 hours Pacific standard time, a Grumman G-164B, N705Y, flipped 
over in an open muddy field after executing an emergency landing near Pixley, California.  The 
emergency landing was preceded by a loss of engine power.  The pilot was conducting a Title 14 
CFR 137 visual flight rules local aerial application flight.  The airplane, operated by Pixley 
Dusters, Inc., of Earlimart, California, sustained substantial damage.  The certificated 
commercial pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed.  The flight originated from the operator's private airstrip at Earlimart at 1530 hours.
The operator told a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness inspector that when 
the pilot was executing a 90/270-degree climbing turn, the engine's number three cylinder 
cracked.  The pilot landed the airplane in the soft field, but flipped over shortly after 
touchdown.
An FAA inspector reported that he found the cylinder split between each of the spark plugs.  It 
was also split at the top of the plug to the exhaust valve.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
