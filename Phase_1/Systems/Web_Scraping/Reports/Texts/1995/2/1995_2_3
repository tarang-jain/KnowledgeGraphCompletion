Analysis 
THE HELICOPTER, BEING USED FOR PREDATOR CONTROL, WAS 25 FEET ABOVE THE 
GROUND AND WAS CHASING A BOBCAT. THE PILOT SAID A RIGHT QUARTERING 
TAILWIND GUST CAUSED THE HELICOPTER TO LOSE TAIL ROTOR EFFECTIVENESS 
AND IT BEGAN SPINNING TO THE RIGHT. THE PILOT INCREASED COLLECTIVE AND 
THROTTLE IN AN ATTEMPT TO REGAIN AIRSPEED, BUT THIS CAUSED THE MAIN 
ROTOR RPM TO DROOP AND ALTITUDE WAS INSUFFICIENT TO ALLOW THE 
HELICOPTER TO REGAIN AIRSPEED BY LOWERING THE NOSE. THE PILOT THEN 
REDUCED COLLECTIVE TO REGAIN RPM, BUT THE HELICOPTER CONTINUED TO SPIN 
AND IMPACTED THE TERRAIN. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE LOSS OF TAIL ROTOR EFFECTIVENESS. A FACTOR WAS THE GUSTY RIGHT 
QUARTERING TAILWIND.

Factual Information
 On February 1, 1995, approximately 1500 central standard time, a Bell 47G-4A, N6SR, was 
destroyed when it impacted terrain while maneuvering near El Indio, Texas.  The airline 
transport rated pilot and one passenger were not injured, but a second passenger received 
minor injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The following is based on the pilot/operator report.  The helicopter was being used for predator 
control and was chasing a bobcat about 25 feet above the ground.  The pilot said a right 
quartering tailwind gust caused the helicopter to lose tail rotor effectiveness and it began 
spinning to the right.  He increased collective and throttle in an attempt to regain airspeed, but 
this caused the main rotor RPM to droop and altitude was insufficient to allow the helicopter to 
regain airspeed by diving.  He then reduced collective to regain RPM, but the helicopter 
continued to spin and impacted the terrain.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
