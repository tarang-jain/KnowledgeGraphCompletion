Analysis 
THE PILOT AND HIS THREE PASSENGERS WERE ON A CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHT 
WHEN THEY EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF ENGINE POWER. THE PILOT WAS 
ATTEMPTING A FORCED LANDING ON A ROAD WHEN A CAR GOT IN THE WAY. THE 
PILOT THEN SET UP TO LAND IN A DESERT AREA ADJACENT TO THE ROAD. THE 
AIRCRAFT LANDED HARD AND SHEARED OFF THE LANDING GEAR. A FAA INSPECTOR 
FOUND THAT THE FUEL SELECTOR VALVE WAS POSITIONED TO A FUEL TANK THAT 
WAS EMPTY. THE OTHER THREE FUEL TANKS WERE FULL OF FUEL. THE FUEL PUMP 
FUNCTIONED NORMALLY WHEN ACTIVATED WITH AIRCRAFT BATTERY POWER, AND 
THE FUEL SELECTOR WAS POSITIONED TO A TANK CONTAINING FUEL. NO FUEL WAS 
FOUND IN THE FUEL LINES FROM THE FIREWALL TO THE FUEL PUMP. THE ENGINE 
WAS REMOVED FROM THE AIRCRAFT AND INSTALLED IN A TEST CELL. THE ENGINE 
STARTED WITHOUT HESITATION AND WAS EXERCISED THROUGHOUT ITS NORMAL 
POWER RANGE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
fuel starvation due to the pilot's failure to select a tank containing fuel.

Factual Information
 On January 1, 1995, at 1710 Pacific standard time, an Aero Commander 200D, N200AW, 
collided with the ground during a forced landing attempt in a rural area of Lancaster, 
California.  The forced landing was precipitated by a loss of engine power.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for the operation.  
The aircraft incurred substantial damage.  The pilot sustained serious injuries in the accident 
and died in a hospital on January 18, 1995.  Two of the three passengers incurred minor 
injuries, while one passenger was not injured.  The flight originated at Apple Valley, California, 
on the day of the accident at 1630 as a personal flight to Rosamond, California.
In an oral statement to responding Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, the pilot said the 
engine quit and he was attempting a forced landing on a road when a car got in the way.  The 
pilot then set up to land in a desert area adjacent to the road.  The aircraft landed hard and 
sheared off the landing gear.
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector from the Van Nuys Flight Standards 
District Office responded to the scene.  He reported that the fuel selector valve was positioned 
to a right wing fuel tank which was found to be empty.  The three remaining fuel tanks in the 
aircraft were full of fuel.  The fuel pump functioned normally when activated with aircraft 
battery power, and the fuel selector was positioned to a tank containing fuel.  No fuel was 
found in the fuel lines from the firewall to the fuel pump.
The engine was removed from the aircraft and sent to the Teledyne Continental factory, where 
it was installed in a test cell under the supervision of FAA inspectors.  The engine started 
without hesitation and was exercised throughout its normal power range.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
