Analysis 
DURING DESCENT FOR THE LANDING APPROACH THE PILOT EXPERIENCED 
UNCOMMANDED ROLL DIVERGENCE.  THE AIRCRAFT WAS AT APPROXIMATELY 240 
KNOTS, CLEAN CONDITION, AND POWER WAS REDUCED AT THE TIME OF THE 
OCCURRENCE.  THE AIRCRAFT WAS FOLLOWING AN MD-80 WHEN THE EVENT 
OCCURRED.  THE FIRST PILOT WAS AT THE CONTROLS WHEN THE UNCOMMANDED 
ROLLS OCCURRED, HOWEVER, THE CAPTAIN ASSUMED CONTROL EARLY DURING 
THE SEQUENCE.  IT WAS NOTED THAT THE AUTOPILOT ALTITUDE HOLD WAS 
ENGAGED.  THE INITIAL DIVERGENCE WAS A 20 DEGREE RIGHT ROLL.  AS THE 
RIGHT ROLL WAS DEVELOPING THE PILOT APPLIED A LEFT CORRECTION, AND THE 
AIRCRAFT ROLLED 30 DEGREES LEFT. THE PILOT THEN APPLIED RIGHT RUDDER 
WHICH RESULTED IN THE WINGS COMING TO THE LEVEL ATTITUDE.  AN 
EXAMINATION OF THE FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM FAILED TO REVEAL ANY 
ANOMALIES.

Factual Information
 On January 1, 1995, at 1150 central standard time, a Boeing 737- 3A4, N326SW, experienced a 
partial loss of roll control during approach near Houston, Texas.  There was no airplane 
damage and none of the 5 crewmembers or 61 passengers were injured.  The airplane was 
operated by Southwest Airlines as Flight 293, scheduled domestic Part 121 service from Dallas, 
Texas, to the Houston, Texas, Intercontinental Airport.  The airplane was level at 6,000 feet on 
a standard instrument arrival in visual meteorological conditions decelerating through about 
240 knots.  
The copilot was flying the airplane when the flight encountered wake turbulence from a MD-
80.  Flight 293 was in a clean configuration and power reduced in order to decelerate.  The 
autopilot was engaged in altitude hold and control wheel steering.  After encountering the 
disturbed air the airplane began to roll right 20 degrees and the copilot responded with left 
yoke. The airplane then rolled into a 30 degree left bank and the copilot applied full right 
aileron, but the roll continued to the left.  The captain took control of the airplane and applied 
right rudder as he maintained the aileron input.  Control was regained and the remainder of 
the flight was normal.
Inspection and evaluation of the flight control systems failed to reveal any anomalies.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
