Factual Information
 On October 1, 1995, at 1130 central daylight time (cdt), a Luscombe Phantom 1, N272Y, piloted 
by an airline transport pilot was substantially damaged when it ran off the edge of runway 27 
(3,028' x 36' dry asphalt) while landing at Rolla Downtown Airport, Rolla, Missouri.  The 
personal 14 CFR part 91 flight was not operating on a flight plan.  Visual meteorological 
conditions existed at the time of the accident.  The pilot reported no injures.  The flight 
departed Matton, Illinois, at 1000 cdt.
The pilot reported after the aircraft touched down, full right rudder input would not stop the 
aircraft from turning left.  The aircraft departed the left side of the runway, coming to rest 
opposite the landing direction.  Examination of runway 27 revealed a single tire skid mark 
approximately 15 feet long located 100 feet from the runway end.  N272Y is equipped with 
mechanical brakes which are operated by cables.
During a telephone interview with the pilot he said he thought the left brake locked.  The pilot 
said the runway was in poor condition.  The airport facility directory states that the runway has 
broken asphalt with loose material, and is rolling and uneven.  During a telephone 
conversation with the airport operator he said the airport runway was currently being 
resurfaced.
N272Y'S landing gear strut wires failed during the accident. The pilot said the landing gear 
strut wires had been chromed, which may have weakened them.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
