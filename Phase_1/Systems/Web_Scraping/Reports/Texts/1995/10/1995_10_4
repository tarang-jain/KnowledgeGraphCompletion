AFTER AN UNEVENTFUL FLIGHT, THE BALLOON PILOT COMMENCED AN APPROACH 
TO LAND IN A FIELD LOCATED BETWEEN POWER LINES AND AN APARTMENT 
COMPLEX. ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, SHE 'PASSED OVER THE POWER LINES', AND 
ABOUT 20 FEET PRIOR TO TOUCH DOWN, A 'SUDDEN, STRONG GUST OF WIND' 
PUSHED THE BALLOON 'DOWNWARD AND BACKWARD.' SUBSEQUENTLY, THE 
ENVELOPE CONTACTED THE POWER LINES THAT SHE HAD JUST PASSED OVER, AND 
THE BASKET CONTACTED THE GROUND. AFTER CONTACTING THE GROUND, THE 
BALLOON BEGAN TO SLIDE SIDEWAYS AND CONTACTED ANOTHER POWER LINE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO COMPENSATE FOR WIND CONDITIONS AND MAINTAIN 
ADEQUATE CLEARANCE FROM THE POWER LINES DURING THE APPROACH. A 
FACTOR WAS THE SUDDEN WIND GUST.

Factual Information
 On October 1, 1995, at 1845 central daylight time, an Aerostar S60A balloon, N63286, was 
substantially damaged during an approach to land in a field near Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  The 
pilot and two passengers were not injured.  The balloon, owned by the pilot, was being 
operated under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  The personal flight was participating in a local ballooning 
event.  A flight plan was not filed and visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
In an interview, the pilot stated that she commenced an approach to land in a field located 
between power lines and an apartment complex.  During the approach, she "passed over the 
power lines", and about 20 feet prior to touch down, a "sudden, strong gust of wind" pushed 
the balloon "downward and backward."  Subsequently, the envelope contacted the power lines 
that she had "passed over", and the basket contacted the ground.  She further stated that, after 
contacting the ground, the balloon began to slide sideways and contacted another power line.
Examination of the balloon revealed arcing on the basket attaching cables and a torn envelope.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
