Analysis 
THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH TREES DURING AN EMERGENCY DESCENT.  
ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, DURING A NON-PRECISION, INSTRUMENT APPROACH, 
THE ENGINE BEGAN RUNNING ROUGHLY.  CARBURETOR HEAT WAS APPLIED 
WITHOUT EFFECT, AND THE ENGINE QUIT.  A RE-START WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND 
THE ENGINE RAN FOR A FEW SECONDS.  IT BEGAN TO RUN ROUGHLY, AGAIN, AND 
QUIT. THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH TREES AS THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO REACH 
AN OPEN FIELD.  THE PILOT/OWNER STATED THAT HE REGULARLY USED 
AUTOMOTIVE GASOLINE TO FUEL HIS AIRPLANE.  THE USE OF AUTOMOTIVE 
GASOLINE IS NOT APPROVED BY THE MANUFACTURER OF THE ENGINE, AND 
CONTINUOUS USE OF AUTOMOTIVE GASOLINE MAY LEAD TO STICKING OR 
CORRODED ENGINE VALVES. AN EXAMINATION OF THE AIRCRAFT ENGINE 
REVEALED THAT THE LOSS OF POWER WAS CAUSED BY STUCK INTAKE AND 
EXHAUST VALVES WHILE IN FLIGHT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER BECAUSE OF STICKING VALVES.  A FACTOR WAS THE 
CONTINUOUS USE OF AN IMPROPER FUEL GRADE.

Factual Information
 On March 3, 1995, about 1735 eastern standard time, a Cessna 150L, N1321Q, collided with 
trees during an emergency descent. The pilot reported that there was a loss of engine power 
while conducting a non-precision, instrument approach into the Jackson County Airport, 
runway 34, Jefferson, Georgia. The airplane was operated by the pilot under the provisions of 
14 CFR Part 91, and instrument flight rules (IFR). An IFR flight plan was filed for the personal 
flight. There were no injuries to the instrument rated private pilot, and the airplane was 
substantially damaged. Origination of the flight was Dayton, Ohio, about 1255, on the same 
day.
According to the pilot, during the approach, the engine began running roughly.  After passing 
the final approach fix, inbound, the engine RPMs dropped to 1400.  Carburetor heat was 
applied without effect, and the engine quit.   Atlanta Air Traffic Control Center records 
indicated, at 1735, the pilot notified air traffic control (ATC) that he had lost his engine.  A re-
start was accomplished, and the pilot notified ATC that he would complete the approach.  The 
pilot stated that the engine ran at full power for a few seconds before it began running roughly, 
again, and quit.   The pilot attempted a forced landing in a field 4 miles southwest of the 
airport.  The airplane collided with trees approximately 50 yards before reaching the field.   
ATC notified local authorities that contact with the aircraft had been lost.  Jefferson County 
Sheriff's Office personnel located the aircraft wreckage, and the pilot suffered no injuries.  
The pilot stated that he had last purchased fuel in Dayton, Ohio, where the aircraft was topped 
off with automotive gasoline.  He also indicated that he regularly used automotive gasoline to 
fuel the airplane.  According to the engine manufacturer,  the use of automotive fuels in any of 
their aircraft engines is not recommended or authorized.   Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) 
authorizes only the use of fuels recommended in the engine operating manuals.  The minimum 
fuel grade approved for use in the 0-200 model engine is 80 octane.  According to TCM, all 
Continental aircraft engines are to be operated only on aviation fuel.  The continuous use of 
automotive fuel can lead to sticking or corroded valves due to the absence of lead in the fuel.  
Lead is used to lubricate the valve in the valve guide in normal operation.  Lead also cushions 
the valves as they are closed on the valve seat by the valve springs.  Insufficient lubrication can 
lead to scuffing and scoring of engine valves.
According to the pilot, he had experienced similar engine problems on a previous flight from 
Jackson County Airport, on February 26, 1995, to Dayton, Ohio.  The pilot recalled that after 
climbing to 8200 feet, the engine began to loose power.  The engine RPMs dropped from 2500 
to 1500.  The pilot applied carburetor heat, and the engine began to increase RPMs and run 
normal.  The pilot stated that he believed he had corrected the problem, and that he was able to 
complete the remainder of the flight without any further problems.
An examination of the engine showed evidence of severe scoring and scratching on all engine 
valves.  The exhaust valves also showed coking on the stem that operated in the valve guide.  
The examination concluded that the loss of power was due to stuck valves while in flight.
The Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report, NTSB Form 6120.4, filled out by the pilot was 
never received.  He declined to fill out a second report.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
