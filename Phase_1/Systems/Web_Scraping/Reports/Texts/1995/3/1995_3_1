Analysis 
ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, APPROXIMATELY TEN MINUTES INTO THE FLIGHT, THE 
ENGINE BEGAN TO RUN ROUGH.  THE PILOT STATED HE BEGAN TO TROUBLESHOOT 
AND EVERYTHING APPEARED NORMAL EXCEPT THE FUEL FLOW WAS LOW.  AT THIS 
TIME HE ADVANCED THE THROTTLE, SWITCHED FUEL TANKS, AND TURNED THE 
FUEL BOOST PUMP ON.  THE PILOT STATED HE THEN HEARD A 'BANG' FROM THE 
ENGINE AND ALL ENGINE POWER WAS LOST.  THE PILOT MADE A FORCED LANDING 
ON AN ACCESS ROAD ADJACENT TO A HIGHWAY. POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION 
REVEALED THE NUMBER FOUR CYLINDER HAD SEPARATED FROM THE CRANKCASE.  
FRACTURES OF THE CYLINDER HOLD DOWN STUDS SHOWED NO CLEAR EVIDENCE 
OF FATIGUE CRACKING.  FRACTURES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF OVERSTRESS 
SEPARATIONS. FRETTING DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED ON THE MATING CYLINDER 
FLANGE, CRANKCASE BOSS, AND METAL FOLDS ON THE CYLINDER FLANGE/HOLE 
WALL CORNERS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the failure of the number four cylinder due to a loose cylinder hold down stud.  A factor in the 
accident was the embankment.

Factual Information
 On March 1, 1995, at 1730 central standard time, a Piper PA-R, N1978J, registered to Lowe 
Automotive, St. Louis, Missouri, was substantially damaged following a loss of engine power 
and subsequent off-airport forced landing near Joliet, Illinois.  The private pilot and one 
passenger reported minor injuries.  The 14 CFR Part 91 flight originated in West Chicago, 
Illinois, at 1710 with an intended destination of Bloomington, Illinois.  An IFR flight plan was 
filed and visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time.
According to the pilot, approximately ten minutes after departing DuPage County Airport, 
West Chicago, Illinois, the engine began to run rough.  The pilot stated he began to 
troubleshoot and "everything appeared good except [the] fuel flow was low."  At this time, he 
advanced the throttle, switched fuel tanks, and turned the fuel boost pump on.  The pilot stated 
he then heard a "bang" from the engine and all engine power was lost.  The pilot made a forced 
landing on an access road adjacent to a highway.  While landing, the airplane hit an 
embankment before coming to rest. 
Postaccident examination revealed the number four cylinder was separated from the crankcase 
but still attached to the exhaust stack and ignition wires.  The base of the cylinder was 
substantially damaged but there was no obvious damage to the inside walls of the cylinder.  
The bottom skirt of the number four piston was also substantially damaged.  
The lower left cylinder hold down stud was found completely out of the crankcase, but still in 
the hole of the cylinder base flange with the nut attached.  Another stud, which was found at 
the accident site, was fractured nearly flush with the underside of the assembled nut.  Both 
studs were sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory, Washington, D.C., for further examination.  
Examination revealed the threads of the intact stud were damaged between the underside of 
the nut to a position corresponding to the plane of the crankcase cylinder boss when the stud is 
assembled to the crankcase.  The Metallurgist Factual Report stated "the thread damage was as 
if the thread crowns had been flattened by the cylinder flange moving against this area."  
Examination of the other stud disclosed features indicative of an overstress separation with no 
evidence of preexisting cracking.
A second postaccident examination of the cylinder and crankcase was done by an NTSB 
Metallurgist at DuPage Airport where the airplane was being stored.  Examination showed no 
clear evidence of fatigue cracking.  All fractures appeared to be representative of overstress 
separations.  No welding repair to the crankcase was observed.  Fretting damage was observed 
on the mating cylinder flange, crankcase boss, and metal folds on the cylinder flange/hole wall 
corners.  (See attached Metallurgist Factual Report)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
