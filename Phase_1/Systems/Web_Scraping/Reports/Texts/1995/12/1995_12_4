Location:
NEWTON, KS
Accident Number:
CHI96LA044
Date & Time:
12/01/1995, 1300 CST 
Registration:
N95SF
Aircraft:
HERRING SPORT FAN
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
During takeoff, the airplane experienced a total loss of engine power. The pilot maneuvered the 
airplane to avoid traffic. As a result, the airspeed became too low and the descent rate could not 
be stopped. The airplane slid off the paved roadway into a ravine. Postaccident examination 
revealed the engine had low compression in one of the two cylinders. The pilot stated he 
thought the loss of power resulted from an ignition problem. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
a loss of engine power for undetermined reasons. A factor related to the accident was the 
presence of traffic requiring the pilot to perform an evasive maneuver.

Factual Information
 On December 1, 1995, at 1300 central standard time (cst), a Herring Dana Sport Fan, N95SF, 
owned and operated by a private pilot, was substantially damaged during a forced landing, 
shortly after takeoff from runway 17 at Newton City Airport, Kansas.  The pilot reported minor 
injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The personal 
14 CFR Part 91 flight was not operating on a flight plan.  
From the pilot's written statement, the airplane made a normal takeoff, at approximately 300 
feet the engine lost total power.  After an unsuccessful restart, the pilot attempted to land on a 
paved road.  The pilot stated, "...glide was extended to avoid traffic.  As a result, the airspeed 
was too low and descent rate could not be arrested ... ."  The airplane came to rest in a ravine 
alongside the road.
Post accident examination of the airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration Principal 
Maintenance Inspector (PMI), revealed low compression on one out of the two cylinders.  The 
pilot/owner believes the problem might have been an ignition problem.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
