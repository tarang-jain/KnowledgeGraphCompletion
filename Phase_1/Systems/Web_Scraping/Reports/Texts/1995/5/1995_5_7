Analysis 
DURING FINAL APPROACH TO AN OFFSHORE OIL PLATFORM, THE HELICOPTER 
FLEW INTO THE EXHAUST GASES OF A FLARE BOOM WHICH WAS BURNING EXCESS 
GAS. WHEN THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO ADD POWER TO ARREST HIS DESCENT AND 
BRING THE HELICOPTER TO A HOVER FOR LANDING, HE GOT NO ENGINE RESPONSE. 
THE HELICOPTER SETTLED AND COLLIDED WITH THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM AND 
DESCENDED IN AN INVERTED ATTITUDE INTO THE WATER ADJACENT TO THE 
PLATFORM. THE PILOT AND FRONT SEAT PASSENGER EXITED THE HELICOPTER 
UNAIDED AND WERE PICKED UP BY A BOAT IN THE VICINITY. THE REAR SEAT 
PASSENGER DID NOT GET OUT OF THE HELICOPTER AND DROWNED. THE PILOT 
SAID HE GOT A LOW ROTOR WARNING JUST BEFORE THE HELICOPTER STRUCK THE 
PLATFORM, BUT DID NOT GET AN ENGINE WARNING. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On May 2, 1995, at 0653 central daylight time, a Bell 206L-3 helicopter, N347AL, impacted the 
water following an approach for landing on an offshore platform in the Gulf of Mexico.  The 
aircraft was destroyed and the pilot and one passenger received serious injuries.  The other 
passenger received fatal injuries.  The flight was being conducted under 14 CFR Part 135 when 
the accident occurred.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a company flight plan 
was filed.  The flight departed Venice, Louisiana, at 0633.
According to the pilot and witnesses, the helicopter was in the final stage of approach to 
Marathon Platform SP86 located 120 degrees at 32 miles from Venice, Louisiana.  The pilot 
added power to come to a hover as he was crossing the platform edge.  He said that the engine 
did not respond to the power demand and the helicopter settled and struck the edge of the 
platform.  The pilot also said that during this time he got a low rotor speed aural warning, but 
did not get an engine warning.
According to witnesses, as the helicopter descended toward the water, after striking the 
platform, it rolled inverted. The pilot and one passenger exited the helicopter, which was 
floating inverted, and were picked up by a boat operating in the vicinity.
The other passenger was found in the helicopter by divers several hours later.   
At the time of the accident, the platform had a flare boom in operation to burn off excess gas.  
This flare boom was located directly upwind from the approach path to the platform landing 
pad, and persons on the platform said they could feel a considerable increase in temperature as 
the burned excess gas passed over the platform. (See attached photographs).  According to Air 
Logistics Operations personnel, the normal approach path of the helicopter would cause it to 
pass through the flare exhaust during the final phase of approach to the platform.  Both the 
company personnel and the engine manufacturers' representative expressed the opinion that 
performance of both the helicopter rotor system and engine could be adversely affected by the 
flare exhaust gas. 
INJURIES TO PERSONS
The pilot, who occupied the right front seat, and one passenger, who occupied the left front 
seat, received serious injuries attributed to impact forces.  The passenger in the cabin of the 
helicopter received fatal injuries due to drowning.
OTHER DAMAGE
During the impact sequence, a portion of the helicopter struck the edge of the platform causing 
visible damage. (See attached photographs).
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
The pilot's last date of issue on his certificate was March 17, 1989.  He held an airline transport 
certificate with commercial privileges in rotorcraft - helicopter, and a helicopter instrument 
certificate.  According to FAA records, his other helicopter experience was in the Boeing 107 
and Sikorsky S-58.
The pilot's last medical certificate was issued on March 28, 1995.  It was a 2nd class certificate 
with the restriction that the "holder must possess glasses that correct for near vision."

A review of the pilot's records indicate no previous accidents or incidents.
The day prior to the accident the pilot came on duty at 0530, was on duty for 13 hours, and 
during that duty period flew 1.9 hours in the accident aircraft.  He was released from duty at 
1830.  The accident flight was his first flight of the day and he came on duty at 0530. 
For additional pilot information refer to page 3 of this document.   
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
Era Aviation, Inc., provides Gulf of Mexico weather service to the operator.  Weather in the gulf 
in the area where the accident occurred was overcast skies with visibility ranging from 7 to 15 
miles, temperatures in the low 70s and winds generally from the north at 11 to 25 knots.  Water 
temperature was not recorded.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
Witness marks on the platform edge and witness observations provided evidence that the 
helicopter struck the platform prior to making an uncontrolled inverted descent to the water 
beside the platform.  The helicopter was later recovered by a work boat. During the recovery, 
additional damage occurred.  (See attached photographs).  The helicopter was eventually taken 
ashore and moved by surface transportation to the operator's maintenance facilities in New 
Iberia, Louisiana, where an examination of the airframe, drive train, systems, and engine was 
conducted.  The examination provided no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.
SURVIVAL ASPECTS
The pilot and front seat passenger remained in their respective seats during the impact 
sequence.  Both seats were equipped with four point restraint devices which remained intact 
and operable.  These persons extracted themselves from the inverted and submerged cockpit.  
A determination of the use of seat restraints by the passenger could not be determined.  He was 
briefed and was using the seat restraint on departure.  His body was recovered from the cabin 
area and he was not strapped in at the time of recovery.
TESTS AND RESEARCH
During the examination of the helicopter, the fuel pump, fuel control, governor, bleed valve, 
and fuel nozzle were tested.  All units operated within design parameters.
ADDITIONAL DATA/INFORMATION
The wreckage was released to the Director of Safety, Air Logistics, Inc., on May 5, 1995, no 
parts were retained.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
