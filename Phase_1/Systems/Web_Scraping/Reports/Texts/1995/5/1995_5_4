Analysis 
AFTER SEVERAL TOUCH-AND-GO LANDINGS, THE PRIVATE PILOT MADE A FULL STOP 
LANDING, TAXIED BACK, AND TOOK OFF AGAIN.  NO PROBLEMS WERE REPORTED 
DURING THE TAKEOFF.  THE PILOT ENTERED THE TRAFFIC PATTERN AND 
ATTEMPTED ANOTHER LANDING.  THE PILOT STATED THAT SHE IMMEDIATELY LOST 
DIRECTIONAL CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE AFTER THE NOSE LANDING GEAR 
SETTLED ONTO THE RUNWAY.  THE AIRPLANE VEERED OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE 
RUNWAY, SKIDDED INTO THE DIRT, NOSED OVER, AND WAS SUBSTANTIALLY 
DAMAGED.  EXAMINATION OF THE NOSE LANDING GEAR ASSEMBLY REVEALED 
THAT THE CENTER SCISSOR BOLT WAS MISSING AND THE NOSE GEAR WAS COCKED 
TO ONE SIDE.  THE BOLT WAS FOUND ON THE RUNWAY ABOUT 800 FEET FROM THE 
WRECKAGE.  EXAMINATION OF THE BOLT REVEALED THAT NO COTTER KEY HAD 
BEEN INSTALLED TO SECURE THE NUT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF A NOSE LANDING GEAR ASSEMBLY BOLT (NO 
COTTER KEY INSTALLED) BY UNKNOWN MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL.  THIS LED TO A 
FAILURE OF THE NOSE LANDING GEAR STEERING AND SUBSEQUENT NOSEOVER 
DURING LANDING ROLLOUT.

Factual Information
 On May 1, 1995, about 1035 hours Pacific daylight time, N2548Y, a Cessna 172, registered to 
Methow Valley Flyers, Inc., Twisp, Washington, nosed over during landing at the Twisp Airport 
and was substantially damaged.  The private pilot, the sole occupant, received minor injuries.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed.  The personal 
flight was conducted under 14 CFR 91.
     The pilot stated that she performed several touch-and-go landings at another airport 
without any reported problems.  She then flew to Twisp Municipal Airport to practice more 
landings.  She entered the traffic pattern and landed uneventfully on runway 28. She then back 
taxied the airplane for another takeoff. 
     According to the pilot: 
     The takeoff roll seemed normal.  I flew the pattern,      touched down just beyond the 
displaced threshold as I'd      planned, lowered the nose gear, and couldn't control      the 
direction of the plane....  It veered onto the left      and skidded into the dirt.  The nose wheel 
stopped.       The rest of the plane kept going and flipped over.
     According to an FAA certified airframe and powerplant mechanic who was visiting the area 
at the time of the accident, the nose gear was cocked 90 degrees to one side.  Further 
examination revealed that the nose landing gear assembly center scissor bolt was missing.  The 
bolt secures the connection of the two scissor castings of the nose gear assembly. 
     The bolt was later found about 1,000 feet from the threshold of the departure end of the 
runway, and 800 feet prior to the final resting site of the wreckage.   According to the 
mechanic, the bolt did not exhibit any mechanical abnormalities.  Closer inspection of the bolt 
revealed that the cotter key was missing, and the cotter key hole was filled with grease, oil 
residue, and dirt.  The mechanic further stated that no cotter key appeared to have been 
installed on the bolt.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
