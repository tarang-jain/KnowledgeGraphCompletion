Factual Information
 On May 1, 1995, at 1214 central daylight time, an experimental Sorrel, N2026, was 
substantially damaged when it collided with transmission lines after taking off from Aero Park 
Airport, Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.  The pilot and passenger reported minor injuries.  The 
local 14 CFR Part 91 pleasure flight operated without a flight plan in visual meteorological 
conditions. 
According to the pilot, he performed a normal preflight in preparation for the local pleasure 
flight.  The pilot stated he then taxied to the end of runway 05 (1250' x 110') at Aero Park and 
began his takeoff roll.  The pilot stated the ground roll was normal and the airplane lifted off 
mid-field.  While climbing the airplane struck transmission lines which are located 
approximately a 1/4 mile from the end of the runway.  The pilot made a forced landing.  While 
landing the airplane nosed over and came to rest in an inverted position.
In a telephone interview with the pilot, he stated "everything seemed fine except for the 
[airplane's] climb rate."  The pilot stated "...the engine instruments were in the green."  He 
stated that he did have the flaps extended to their normal extension of 5-10 degrees on takeoff.  
The pilot stated he had full fuel aboard and a weight and balance calculation done prior to the 
flight indicated the weight to be 100 pounds under the airplane's gross weight.  
A postaccident examination of the engine revealed no mechanical abnormalities.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
