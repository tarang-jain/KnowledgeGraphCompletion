Substantial
Defining Event:

1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE PILOT REPORTED IN HIS WRITTEN STATEMENT THAT HE WAS CONDUCTING AN 
ENGINE RUNUP BECAUSE THE ENGINE WOULD NOT DEVELOP FULL POWER.  HE 
DECIDED TO TAXI DOWN THE RUNWAY WITH NO INTENTION OF TAKING OFF, BUT 
INADVERTENTLY BECAME AIRBORNE. SHORTLY AFTER THE UNINTENTIONAL 
TAKEOFF, THE ENGINE LOST PARTIAL POWER, TURNED  TO THE RIGHT AND 
IMPACTED TERRAIN. POST-ACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED 
EVIDENCE OF HEAT DAMAGE AND ABNORMAL PISTON RING WEAR.  THERE WERE 
SCRAPE MARKINGS ON THE PISTON, PISTON RINGS, AND CYLINDER WALL. THE 
PILOT STATED THAT HE PERFORMED THE CYLINDER AND RING CHANGE AND WAS 
NOT AWARE THAT THE CYLINDER AND RING COMBINATION WERE NOT 
COMPATIBLE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's improper maintenance installation and his inadvertent takeoff.  A factor was the 
pilot's inadequate pre-flight planning.

Factual Information
 On May 2, 1995, at 1827 eastern standard time, a Franklin EAA Bi- Plane/P1, registered to a 
private owner, of Rockville, Indiana, received substantial damage on impact with terrain 
following a takeoff to the west and experiencing a loss of engine power.  The personal 14 CFR 
Part 91 flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions.  The pilot reported minor 
injuries.  No flight plan was on file.  The local flight was on departure from the Bulter Airport, 
Rockville, Indiana, at the time of the accident.  
The pilot reported in his written statement, that he was conducting an engine runup, because 
the engine would not develop full power. He decided to taxi down the runway with no intention 
of taking off, but inadvertently became airborne.  The engine sustained a power loss shortly 
after liftoff. 
Witnesses stated that the takeoff appeared normal until at the end of the runway, the engine 
sounded like it was reduced to idle power.  
Postaccident examination of the engine was conducted.  An FAA Inspector's report stated, 
"...evidence of heat damage and abnormal piston ring wear.  There were scrape markings on 
the piston, piston rings, and cylinder wall...".  The pilot said that he performed a cylinder and 
piston ring change and was not aware that the rings and cylinder were not compatible.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
