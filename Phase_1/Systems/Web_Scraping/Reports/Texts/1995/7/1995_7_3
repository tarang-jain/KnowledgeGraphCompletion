Analysis 
DURING THE AIRCRAFT PREFLIGHT INSPECTION, THE PILOT VERIFIED THE MAIN 
FUEL TANKS WERE FULL BUT DID NOT CHECK THE AUXILIARY TANKS. WHILE 
PERFORMING THE PRE-TAKEOFF CHECK, THE PILOT 'GLANCED AT' THE FUEL 
SELECTOR AND 'THOUGHT IT WAS ON THE LEFT MAIN' FUEL TANK. SHORTLY AFTER 
TAKEOFF AND AT AN ALTITUDE OF 150 FEET, THE ENGINE LOST POWER. THE 
AIRPLANE LANDED 'VERY HARD' ON THE TAKEOFF RUNWAY, 800 FEET FROM THE 
DEPARTURE END. POSTACCIDENT INSPECTION DISCLOSED THE RIGHT AUXILIARY 
FUEL TANK HAD ABOUT 2 INCHES OF FUEL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK. THE LEFT 
AUXILIARY FUEL TANK WAS DRY AS IT WOULD NOT REGISTER ON A DIPSTICK. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO VERIFY THE FUEL TANK SELECTOR POSITION AND THE 
RESULTANT FUEL STARVATION INDUCED POWER LOSS.

Factual Information
 On July 1, 1995, at 0733 mountain daylight time, a Piper PA-32- 260, N4823T, was 
substantially damaged during a forced landing at Farmington, New Mexico.  The private pilot 
and his four passengers were not injured.  Visual meteorological  conditions prevailed.
The following is based on the pilot/operator report.  Prior to departing Page, Arizona, on June 
30, the pilot checked the two auxiliary fuel tanks and estimated each contained 5 gallons.  He 
flew to Farmington, New Mexico, where he requested that the main tanks be filled to capacity.  
Prior to his departure from Farmington on July 1, the pilot checked the main fuel tanks and 
verified they were full.  He did not check the auxiliary fuel tanks.  While performing the pre-
takeoff check, the pilot "glanced at" the fuel selector and "thought it was on the left main" fuel 
tank.  Shortly after takeoff from Farmington and at an altitude of 150 feet, the engine lost 
power.  The pilot switched the fuel selector "to the next tank to the right," then made a "very 
hard" landing on the 800 feet of runway remaining.
According to the Piper PA-32 Owner's Handbook, fuel tank selector positions (from left to 
right) are as follows:  LEFT AUX - LEFT MAIN - RIGHT MAIN - RIGHT AUX.  An OFF 
position is also provided.
According to the statement submitted by the Federal Aviation Administration inspector who 
examined the airplane, the pilot stated "he might have made his takeoff" with the fuel selector 
in the left auxiliary fuel tank position.  The pilot asked the inspector "how long it would take for 
fuel to reach the engine if it had exhausted the fuel supply from a fuel tank."  The inspector said 
the right auxiliary fuel tank had about 2 inches of fuel at the bottom of the tank.  The left 
auxiliary fuel tank "was completely dry as it would not measure on the dipstick."
In the pilot/operator report the pilot wrote, "In the future, I will always check all of the tanks 
on the airplane and not assume that the auxiliary tanks are unimportant."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
