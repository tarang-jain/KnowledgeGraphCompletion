Factual Information
 On July 1, 1995, at 1150 central daylight time, a Cessna 177B, N13734, sustained substantial 
damage during a forced landing due to loss of engine power near Nappanee, Indiana.  The 
private pilot reported no injury. The 14 CFR Part 91 flight departed Rochester, Indiana, enroute 
to Mishawaka, Indiana.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was 
filed.
In his written statements and phone conversations, the pilot reported that he had departed 
Mishawaka with the fuel gauges indicating 1/2 full. He landed at Rochester, Indiana, but did 
not refuel before returning to Mishawaka.  While returning, he executed a practice approach 
and missed approach at Goshen, Indiana.  As he was proceeding to the Goshen VOR (GHS) for 
the missed approach procedure, the engine sputtered and he shut the engine down.  He had 
been flying for about two hours when this occured. 
He then picked out a field and proceeded with the forced landing. He touched down in a bean 
field that he had picked out as his landing spot.  Due to the recent rains the ground was soft. 
After traveling about 200 feet, the nose wheel dug into the dirt and the airplane to flipped over 
onto its back. 
During the inspection of the airplane, both wing tank sumps were drained and each contained 
about 1/3 cup of fuel.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
