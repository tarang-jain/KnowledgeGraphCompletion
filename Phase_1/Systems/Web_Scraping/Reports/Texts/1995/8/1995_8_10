Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE PILOT REPORTED THAT AFTER TAKEOFF, HE REMAINED AT A LOW ALTITUDE TO 
MANEUVER AROUND CLASS B AIRSPACE. ABOUT TEN MINUTES INTO THE FLIGHT, 
'THE FUEL PRESSURE DROPPED TO ZERO' AND THE ENGINE LOST POWER. DURING 
THE FORCED LANDING, THE 'GEAR CAUGHT IN MUD,' COLLAPSED AND THE 
AIRPLANE NOSED OVER. IN HIS WRITTEN STATEMENT, THE PILOT REPORTED THAT 
'PRIOR TO TAKEOFF, ON SEVERAL PREVIOUS FLIGHTS, FUEL SELECTOR WAS HARD 
TO MOVE.'  EXAMINATION OF THE FUEL SYSTEM REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF 
PREIMPACT MALFUNCTION. THE FUEL SELECTOR VALVE FUNCTIONED NORMALLY 
WHEN TESTED, HOWEVER, THE VALVE WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO OPERATE FROM 
THE PILOT'S SEAT. IT WAS POSITIONED NEAR THE FRONT LEFT CORNER OF THE 
SEAT, AND ACCORDING TO A FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION INSPECTOR, WAS 
'DIFFICULT TO MANIPULATE, AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHICH TANK 
WAS SELECTED OR IF THE VALVE WAS IN THE PROPER POSITION.' 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's operation of the airplane with a known deficiency in the fuel selector, and his 
improper positioning of the fuel selector.  A factor relating to the accident was: the fuel 
selector's restriction of movement.

Factual Information
 On August 2, 1995, at 1130 eastern daylight time, a Nanchang Yak 18A, operated by Rensselaer 
Learning Systems, Inc., sustained substantial damage during a forced landing in Superior 
Township, Michigan.  The commercial pilot reported no injuries.  The personal flight 
originated in Plymouth, Michigan a few minutes prior to the accident with a planned 
destination of Rochester, New York.  The 14 CFR Part 91 flight was conducted in visual 
meteorological conditions and no flight plan was filed.
The pilot reported that he filled all three fuel tanks prior to takeoff.  After takeoff, he remained 
at a low altitude to maneuver around class B airspace.  About ten minutes into the flight, "the 
fuel pressure dropped to zero" and the engine lost power.  He did not move the fuel selector 
because he thought he had selected the fuselage tank, the higher of the three.  He extended the 
landing gear, "turned everything off except the ELT," and conducted a forced landing.  During 
the landing, the  "gear caught in mud," collapsed and the airplane nosed over.
In his written statement, the pilot reported that "prior to takeoff, on several previous flights, 
fuel selector was hard to move."  
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector who examined the wreckage reported that 
all three fuel tanks were nearly full.  Examination of the fuel system revealed no evidence of 
preimpact malfunction.  Fuel supply lines from the tanks to the engine were intact and 
contained fuel. The fuel quantity in the 2.5 gallon header tank was not determined.  The vent 
system was clear and the fuel pump operated when it was tested.  He reported that the fuel 
selector valve position was indeterminate.  The valve functioned normally when tested, 
however, the valve was very difficult to operate from the pilot's seat.  It was positioned near the 
front left corner of the pilot's seat and was "difficult to manipulate and it was difficult to 
determine which tank was selected or if the valve was in the proper position."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
