Analysis 
THE PLT INITIATED A MAXIMUM POWER TAKEOFF FROM A CONFINED PARKING LOT 
WITH 2 PASSENGERS ON BOARD. THE AREA WAS BOARDERED BY OBSTRUCTIONS & 
PEOPLE. THE PLT RPRTD THAT DURING LIFT-OFF, SHE INCREASED POWER TO 2900 
RPM, LIFTED OFF TO A 4' HOVER WITH 33' OF MANIFOLD PRESSURE, THEN BEGAN A 
MAX PERFORMANCE TAKEOFF, 'PULLING POWER AND TURNING THROTTLE' FOR 
EXTRA RPM WITH SLOW FORWARD SPEED, REACHING 36' OF MANIFOLD PRESSURE. 
AT APRX 15' AGL, THE PLT NOTED A DECREASE IN RPM. SHE INCREASED THROTTLE 
APPLICATION, THEN DECREASED THE COLLECTIVE, BUT WAS UNABLE TO RECOVER 
THE LOSS OF RPM. SHE MADE A LEFT PEDAL TURN TO AVOID OBSTRUCTIONS & 
PEOPLE. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE HELICOPTER TOUCHED DOWN HARD & WAS 
DAMAGED. AN EXAM OF THE ENG DID NOT REVEAL ANY DEFECTS. THE FLT MANUAL 
WARNED THAT LOSS OF ROTOR & ENG RPM WOULD FOLLOW WHEN THE ENG WAS 
OVERBOOSTED. AT 36.5' OF MANIFOLD PRESSURE, THE POP-OFF VALVE WOULD 
HAVE ACTIVATED WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A SLIGHT POWER LOSS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
