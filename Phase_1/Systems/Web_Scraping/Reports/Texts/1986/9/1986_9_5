Analysis 
WHILE APCHG TO LAND, THE REGISTERED ULTRALIGHT ACFT ENCOUNTERED A 
DOWNDRAFT WHICH EXCEEDED ITS CLIMB PERFORMANCE. THE ACFT WAS HEADED 
TWD POWER LINES, SO THE PLT ELECTED TO FLY UNDER THE LINES. AS THE 
ULTRALIGHT WAS CROSSING UNDER THE POWER LINES, ONE OF ITS VERTICAL FINS 
HIT THE BOTTOM CABLE WHICH DISABLED THE ACFT'S LEFT RUDDER CONTROL. 
THE ACFT TURNED TO THE RGT TWD A HILL & WOULD NOT CLIMB SUFFICIENTLY TO 
CLEAR OVER TREES. THE PLT INTENTIONALLY ALLOWED THE ACFT TO MUSH INTO 
THE TREES WHILE HE STILL HAD CONTROL.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
