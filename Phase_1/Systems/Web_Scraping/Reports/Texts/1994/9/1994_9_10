Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE PILOT STATED THAT DURING A LANDING: 'AIRCRAFT FLARED...AND ROSE DUE 
TO GROUND EFFECT.'  THE AIRPLANE FLOATED DOWN THE RUNWAY, AND THE 
TOUCHDOWN OCCURRED FAR DOWN THE RUNWAY.  THE AIRPLANE EXITED THE 
END OF THE RUNWAY, AND THE PILOT APPLIED RIGHT BRAKE TO AVOID IMPACTING 
A FENCE.  THE NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED, AND THE AIRPLANE IMPACTED THE ROUGH 
TERRAIN. THE FAA INSPECTOR STATED IN HIS REPORT: '...THE AIRCRAFT TOUCHED 
DOWN AT HIGH SPEED ON THE LAST 268 FEET OF USABLE RUNWAY.  AFTER 
CONTINUING OFF THE RUNWAY AT HIGH SPEED, THE PILOT PLACED THE AIRCRAFT 
INTO A HARD RIGHT TURN.' 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot maintaining excessive airspeed during the landing, resulting in a touchdown on the 
runway with insufficient distance to stop, and a subsequent intentional ground loop and 
collision with the terrain.  Also causal was the pilot's failure to abort the landing.

Factual Information
 On Thursday, September 1, 1994, at 1435 eastern daylight time, a Beech F33A, N445B, 
registered to the Blue Sky Aviation Association, and piloted by George R. Niccolai, sustained 
substantial damage during a landing at the Block Island State Airport, Block Island, Rhode 
Island.  The pilot and two of the  passengers were not injured.  One passenger received minor 
injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed.  The flight 
was being conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
     In his report, the pilot stated:
          Speed was slowly reduced to 80 MPH on final.             ....Aircraft flared at the "numbers" 
and rose           due to ground effect...eased back as the           aircraft began downward descent.  
Back           pressure applied again and the same           occurrence repeated.
          Aircraft skidded off the runway onto grass           overrun.  Right rudder and brake was 
applied           making aircraft turn to right and slide to           stop.
     The FAA Operations Inspector stated in his report:
          While approaching runway 28...the aircraft touched           down at high speed on the last 
268 feet of usable           runway.  After continuing off the runway at speed,           the pilot placed 
the aircraft into a hard right           turn effectively "ground looping" to a stop.
     The reported wind at the airport was 290 degrees at 9 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
