Analysis 
AFTER A LOCAL FLIGHT, THE PILOT WAS ON FINAL TO THE PRIVATE GRASS STRIP 
WHERE THE FLIGHT ORIGINATED.  HE HELD LEFT CONTROL CORRECTION ON FINAL 
FOR A LEFT QUARTERING HEAD WIND.  ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, AT GROUND 
LEVEL THE WIND 'QUIT.' THE AIRPLANE TOUCHED DOWN WITH THE LEFT MAIN 
GEAR OFF OF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY.  THE PILOT WAS NOT ABLE TO 
DIRECT THE AIRPLANE TO THE CENTER OF THE RUNWAY.  THE AIRPLANE TRAVELED 
ABOUT 90 FEET, THE LEFT GEAR WENT INTO A DITCH, AND THE LEFT WING STRUCK 
A WOODEN POST.  THE AIRPLANE THEN DID A LEFT GROUND LOOP.  WINDS 
REPORTED 11 MILES FROM THE ACCIDENT SITE WERE AT 060 DEGREES AT 8 KNOTS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's (1) inadequate compensation for wind conditions and (2) failure to align with the 
runway during landing touch down.

Factual Information
 On September 1, 1994, at 1030 eastern daylight time, a Piper PA-28R-180, owned and piloted 
by Alfred Barr, was substantially damaged during landing at the Vine Grove Airport, Vine 
Grove, Kentucky.  The pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a 
flight plan had not been filed for the flight operating under 14 CFR 91.
    In the NTSB Form 6120.1/2, the pilot stated that he was using left control and correction on 
final, to compensate for a quartering left head wind, while landing on runway 11.  He further 
stated:
"...At ground level the wind quit.  I touched down heading slightly left of the runway center.  I 
tried to steer right with rudder with no response, probably because the grass runway was wet 
with dew.  The aircraft continued until the left main gear went into a ditch, and left wing end 
hit a short post..."
    In the FAA Inspector's statement, he stated that his investigation revealed the airplane 
touched down on the left side of the runway with the left half of the airplane off of the runway.  
The airplane travelled approximately thirty yards when it struck a wooden post with the left 
wing.  The airplane continued in a sharp left turn causing the left and right main landing gear 
to collapse.
    Winds at an airport, 6 miles north of Vine Grove, were reported to be from 060 degrees an 8 
knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
