STORM APPROACHING FROM THE SOUTH SO HE ELECTED TO MAKE THE NEXT 
APPROACH TO A FULL STOP. DURING FINAL APPROACH THE STUDENT PILOT HAD 
TROUBLE MAINTAINING CONTROL WHEN THE WIND 'SUDDENLY SHIFTED AND THE 
AIRPLANE REACTED VIOLENTLY TO THE TURBULENCE.' THE PILOT WAS ABLE TO 
LAND BUT THE AIRPLANE DEPARTED THE RUNWAY AND NOSED OVER. AN 
INSTRUCTOR PILOT/WITNESS CONFIRMED THE SUDDEN SHIFT IN THE WIND. THE 
APPROACHING STORM AND CHANGE IN WIND CONDITIONS WERE UNFORCASTED.

Factual Information
 On September 1, 1994, at 1916 central daylight time, a Cessna 150M, N66322, was 
substantially damaged when it nosed over during landing at Mesquite, Texas.  The solo student 
pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The following is based on the pilot/operator report.  The pilot was practicing touch and go 
landings when he observed a storm approaching from the south.  He decided to make his next  
approach to a full stop.  He described his final approach as "normal until the wind shifted 
suddenly" and "the plane reacted violently to the turbulence."  The pilot said he was able to 
land but "the wind blew me off the runway" and the airplane nosed over.  He said a flight 
instructor/witness had told him the "wind had changed suddenly while he was on final 
approach, and it appeared he had encountered wind shear."  The abrupt weather changes were 
not forecasted.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
