Analysis 
THE STUDENT PILOT REPORTED THE ENGINE LOST POWER DURING A LOCAL FLIGHT 
AND HE MADE A FORCED LANDING ON ROUGH TERRAIN. POSTACCIDENT 
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE RESTRICTOR FITTING ORIFICE ON THE FUEL PUMP 
WAS COMPLETELY BLOCKED BY CONTAMINATION, OBSTRUCTING THE FLOW OF 
FUEL TO THE ENGINE. THE MOST RECENT ANNUAL INSPECTION WAS 
ACCOMPLISHED 3 1/2 MONTHS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.  AUTOMOTIVE FUEL WAS 
USED IN THE AIRPLANE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the total loss of engine power due to a blocked orifice in the fuel pump.  A related factor is the 
rough/uneven terrain encountered during the forced landing.

Factual Information
 On October 1, 1994, at 0900 central daylight time, an Ercoupe 415-C, N99600, piloted by the 
student pilot/registered owner, experienced a loss of engine power during cruise flight in the 
vicinity of Cloverdale, Indiana.  The airplane sustained substantial damage during the ensuing 
forced landing on rough terrain.  The student pilot, the sole occupant, reported no injuries.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight, no flight plan was filed.  The 
flight originated from a private airstrip in Eminence, Indiana approximately 0830. 
Postaccident examination revealed the header fuel tank was not receiving fuel through the fuel 
pump from the main fuel tanks.  The FAA Inspector stated "...Contamination was found in the 
restrictor fitting...on the fuel pump.  This contamination blocked the orifice...."  The 
contamination was described as a "...hard black piece."  The FAA Inspector stated the pilot 
used automotive fuel in the airplane.  The most recent maintenance on the airplane was an 
Annual Inspection performed June 21, 1994.  An FAA Inspector statement is appended.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
