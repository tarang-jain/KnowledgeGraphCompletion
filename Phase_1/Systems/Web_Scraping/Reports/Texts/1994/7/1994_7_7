Factual Information
 On July 1, 1994, approximately 1200 central daylight time, a Grumman G-164A, N6568, was 
substantially damaged when it impacted the ground near Marked Tree, Arkansas.  The 
airplane, flown by a commercial pilot, was on an local aerial application flight.  There was no 
flight plan filed and visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  The pilot was not injured.
According to the pilot, he had departed a private strip about 5 miles from the field he was 
spraying 10 minutes before the accident.  He stated that, as he was making his turn after the 
second pass at 200 feet AGL, the engine lost power without warning.  He was not sure if it was 
a complete power loss or if the engine was still developing idle power.
The pilot subsequently attempted to land between two tree lines; however, he said that the 
airplane stalled prior to touchdown and one wing dug into the ground and the airplane cart 
wheeled.  The reason for the engine failure was not determined during the field examination 
and it was not subsequently reported by the operator.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
