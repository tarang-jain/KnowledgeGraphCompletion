Factual Information
 On July 1, 1994, at 1300 eastern standard time, a Cessna 441, N815MC, registered to Rico 
Marketing of Flint, Michigan, and piloted by an airline transport rated pilot, was substantially 
damaged when it collided with the ground during an aborted takeoff on runway 27 (7,200' X 
150' dry concrete) at the Bishop International Airport, Flint, Michigan.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The 14 CFR Part 91 positioning flight was not 
operating on a flight plan.  The pilot was the only occupant in the airplane and reported no 
injuries.  The flight was originating from Flint, Michigan, when the accident occurred.
The pilot's written statement indicates he "...experienced a substantial power loss..." during 
takeoff and he "...elected to put the aircraft back on the runway... ."   The pilot said that "... time 
was insufficient to extend the landing gear."  During an interview the pilot stated that both 
lefthand baggage doors opened as the airplane lifted off the runway.  He said he reduced power 
and landed the airplane with the landing gear retracted.
The airplane's owner said that he would park the airplane in the hangar with the baggage doors 
unlatched.  He said he did this to keep from having to unlatch the doors during preflights.  
One witness stated he observed the airplane liftoff the runway followed by an immediate gear 
retraction and the baggage doors opening.  He said that shortly after the doors opened he 
heard the engine sound stop and saw the airplane descend to the runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
