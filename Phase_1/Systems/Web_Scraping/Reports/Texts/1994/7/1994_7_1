Factual Information
 On July 1, 1994, at 1659 Alaska daylight time, a Boeing 737-400, N769AS, operating as Alaska 
Airlines flight 77, was involved in a near-midair-collision (NMAC) with a float equipped Cessna 
185 airplane, N1470Q, within the Juneau, Alaska, class D airspace (airport traffic area and 
control zone).  Alaska flight 77 was operating under 14 CFR 121, as a scheduled domestic air 
carrier arriving from Gustavus, Alaska, and N1470Q was operating under 14 CFR Part 91 as a 
personal flight to Ketchikan from Juneau.  Both aircraft were on a VFR flight plan in visual 
meteorological conditions and were in contact with the Juneau Air Traffic Control Tower.  The 
Boeing was reportedly in an approach turn to final and the Cessna was on a downwind 
departure.  Alaska flight 77 reportedly had five crewmembers and fifty-six passengers on board.  
The Cessna had a private pilot and a passenger on board.  There were no reported injuries and 
no reported aircraft damage.
Both pilots reported a "near miss" condition had occurred and estimated the distance to be 30 
to 50 foot separation, at approximately 800 foot (agl).  The captain of the Boeing reported that 
he took evasive action by employing "max nose up and full power."  The private pilot reported 
that the Boeing passed in front of him at a distance of 50 feet and did not take evasive action.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
