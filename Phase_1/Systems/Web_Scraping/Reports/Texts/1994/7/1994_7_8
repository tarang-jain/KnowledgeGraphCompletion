Analysis 
SHORTLY AFTER LIFTING OFF, THE PILOT LIGHT ON THE BALLOON'S PROPANE 
BURNER EXTINGUISHED FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS, AND ATTEMPTS TO 
RELIGHT IT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. BECAUSE THE BALLOON WAS DESCENDING NEAR 
POWERLINES, THE PILOT 'VENTED' IN ORDER TO RAPIDLY LOSE ALTITUDE. THE 
BALLOON TOUCHED DOWN ON A HIGHWAY, BOUNCED BACK UP, AND THE 
ENVELOPE CONTACTED POWERLINES, BURNING SEVERAL ENVELOPE PANELS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A TOTAL FAILURE OF THE BALLOON'S HEATER SYSTEM (PILOT LIGHT) FOR 
UNDETERMINED REASONS. A FACTOR WAS UNSUITABLE TERRAIN ON WHICH TO 
MAKE A FORCED LANDING.

Factual Information
 On July 1, 1994, approximately 0730 mountain daylight time, N748CB, a Cameron Balloons V-
77, was substantially damaged when it collided with powerlines in Littleton, Colorado.  The 
private pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The following is based on the pilot/operator report.  Shortly after lifting off, the pilot light on 
the propane burner extinguished for undetermined reasons, and attempts to relight it were 
unsuccessful.  Because the balloon was descending near powerlines, the pilot "vented" in order 
to rapidly lose altitude.  The balloon touched down on a highway, bounced back up, and the 
envelope contacted powerlines about 20 feet above the basket.  Several envelope panels were 
damaged by electrical arcing and there was a small grass fire.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
