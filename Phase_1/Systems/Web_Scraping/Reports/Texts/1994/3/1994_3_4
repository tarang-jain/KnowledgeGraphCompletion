Analysis 
According to a report from the operator, the helicopter had completed the assigned fish 
spotting mission and was returning to the ship when it disappeared from the ship's radar, 
about 3 miles short of the vessel. There were no known distress calls prior to the 
disappearance. A search of the area around the last known position of the helicopter revealed 
parts of an emergency float system known to have been installed on the helicopter, and the 
bodies of the pilot and spotter.  No trace of additional aircraft components were found. The 
pilot was a Panamanian citizen who reportedly held a pilot certificate issued by the Republic of 
Panama. The fish spotter was a Mexican national who has not been identified.

Factual Information
 On March 1, 1994, about 0830 hours Pacific standard time, a Bell 206A helicopter, N4712R, 
disappeared at sea under unknown circumstances in international waters at north latitude 17 
degrees 56 minutes by west longitude 109 degrees 46 minutes.  The helicopter, operated by L & 
M Offshore Corporation of Paitilla, Republic of Panama, was engaged in fish spotting 
operations from the Mexico registered tuna vessel, "El Quijote."  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed at the time and a flight plan was filed with the ship.  The helicopter is 
presumed to have been destroyed in the accident sequence.  Both the pilot and the spotter on 
board the helicopter sustained fatal injuries.  The flight originated from the ship on the day of 
the mishap at about 0730 hours as a local fish spotting mission.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
