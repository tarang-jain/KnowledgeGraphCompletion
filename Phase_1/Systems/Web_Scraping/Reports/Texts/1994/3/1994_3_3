Factual Information
 On March 1, 1994, at 0545 mountain standard time, a Cessna 177RG, N2181Q, sustained 
substantial damage after control was lost following takeoff from Vance Brand Airport, 
Longmont, Colorado.  The pilot and passenger received minor injuries.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed for this personal flight to Montevideo, Minnesota.  An IFR flight plan was 
on file.
According to the pilot, the aircraft could not be kept airborne  following takeoff from runway 
29.  The left wing was damaged and the fuselage was buckled.
According to the responding Longmont police officer, who was a pilot, the aircraft wings and 
fuselage were coated with ice when he arrived on scene approximately 20 minutes following 
the accident.  The officer stated that icing conditions were not present at the time, but freezing 
rain had fallen for most of the previous evening. 
In a statement to the responding police officer, the pilot stated that he made a mistake and did 
not deice the aircraft sufficiently prior to takeoff. (See attached police report).  According to the 
enclosed pilot report, there was a slight "buffet" without a stall warning horn "just prior to 
impact."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
