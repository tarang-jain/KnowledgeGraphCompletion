Factual Information
 On March 1, 1994, at 1330 Pacific standard time, a Mikoyan- Gurevich MiG-17T, N306DM, 
sustained substantial damage after an in-flight fire shortly after takeoff from the Aurora, 
Oregon, airport.  The ATP pilot, who was the sole occupant of the aircraft, was uninjured. No 
flight plan was filed for the local flight.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time 
of the accident.
The pilot stated that the former military jet fighter, operated under experimental exhibition 
category provisions, had .9 hours on the engine since overhaul.  He used an afterburner takeoff 
from runway 17 at Aurora.  Climbing through about 500 feet, he felt an explosion and rudder 
vibration, pulled back the power, and selected afterburner off.  He declared an emergency, 
returned to the airport, landing within a couple minutes of takeoff, where the fire department 
put out the fire.  Investigation revealed that an alloy fuel line failed, allowing fuel to flow aft, 
where an electrical invertor in the tail ignited the fuel.  Damage due to the fire was substantial.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
