Factual Information
 On November 1, 1994, about 1946 central standard time, a Cessna 206G airplane, N9924R, 
sustained substantial damage while taxiing from landing at the uncontrolled Butler Memorial 
Airport, Butler, Missouri.  The commercial and airline transport pilots, and the two passengers 
aboard, were not injured.  The flight operated under 14 CFR Part 91 in visual meteorological 
conditions.  The purpose of the non-revenue flight was to transport a juvenile hospital patient 
and his mother to a local hospital.  The flight was operated by the Ararat Shriners Wings of 
Mercy flight program, and was flown by two of their volunteer pilots.
The commercial certificated pilot-in-command reported he was taxiing the airplane towards 
the ramp area to park the airplane, when he turned the airplane onto what he thought was a 
portion of the ramp.  The airplane was actually taxiing on a dirt field, short of the ramp area, 
and subsequently encountered a drainage ditch. The right main landing gear fell into the ditch, 
damaging the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
