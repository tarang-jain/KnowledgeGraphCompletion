Factual Information
 On August 1, 1994, at 1745 eastern daylight time, a DeHavilland DHC-8-311, N433AW, 
operated by Atlantic Coast Airlines and doing business as United Express Flight 6578, was 
substantially damaged while parked at a gate and struck by a ground support vehicle, at Dulles 
International Airport, Washington, D.C.  The three crewmembers and 50 passengers were not 
injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a instrument flight rules flight plan 
had been filed for the flight operating under 14 CFR 121.
    In the NTSB Form 6120.1/2, the Regional Flight Manager stated that the airplane was 
parked at the passenger gate and was being prepared for departure.  The engines were stopped, 
the chocks were in place, the pilots were seated in the cockpit completing weight and balance 
paperwork, and the airstair door was open. 
    He further stated:
"...Baggage tractor DH4 had broken down.  The operator asked the operator of baggage tractor 
DH65 to push disabled DH4 to the west end of the ramp where it could await servicing.  DH65 
began pushing DH4...DH4 steered so as to pass 15 to 20 feet to the left of [N433AW's] nose 
when approaching the service road.  As DH4 entered the service road it began to turn right to 
head west.  At this point DH65 had not yet entered the service road and for the next few feet 
continued in a somewhat southwesterly direction.  The left side of the hitch on the front of 
DH65 apparently contacted the right side of the hitch on the rear of DH4.  Since [they]...were 
actually heading in different directions (DH4 west and DH65 southwest), the effect of the hitch 
interaction was to jerk the front of DH65 sharply to the right causing the driver to lose his seat 
and be pitched halfway off the left side of DH65... the driver's right hand pulled the steering 
wheel down to the right, and his right foot pressed on the accelerator pedal...DH65 smashed 
into the left side of the nose of 433 doing extensive damage..."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
