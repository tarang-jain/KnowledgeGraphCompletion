Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On May 1, 1994, about 2119 hours Pacific daylight time, a Piper PA-28R-201T, N47628, was 
destroyed during a collision sequence with mountainous terrain near La Verne, California.  The 
private pilot was fatally injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal 
night cross-country flight and no flight plan was filed.  The flight originated about 2100 hours 
at Cable Airport, Claremont, California, and was destined for Whiteman Airport, Pacoima, 
California. 
At 1804 on the evening of the accident, the pilot contacted the  Riverside Automated Flight 
Service Station (AFSS) and requested specific preflight weather information (abbreviated 
briefing), prior to departure.  At the time of the briefing, the Riverside Flight Service Station 
had on file a NOTAM (notice to airmen) for the closure of the Whiteman Airport.  The closure 
was for weekdays from 2000 hours to 0600 hours effective April 29, 1994.  Review of a 
transcript of the briefing revealed that the NOTAM information was not given to the pilot.
While en route about 2108, the pilot contacted Burbank Approach Control and stated that he 
was 25 distance measuring equipment miles (DME) east of Van Nuys, California, at 6,500, and 
was requesting visual flight rules (VFR) advisories from Burbank Approach Control for the 
route of flight through the Airport Radar Service Area to the Whiteman Airport. 
The pilot was assigned a transponder code of 5536.  The pilot was then advised that the 
Whiteman Airport was closed for maintenance.  The pilot questioned the duration of the 
closure, and the controller stated, "all night."  The pilot acknowledged.  The controller asked 
the pilot his intentions, and he said, "I'm thinking, just a minute."  He then questioned the 
controller regarding the weather outlook.  Shortly thereafter, he stated that he would return to 
his home base at Cable.
About 2111, Burbank Approach Control terminated their services and requested that the pilot 
change his transponder code to 1200, and they approved a frequency change. 
The aircraft was observed by Burbank recorded radar data to reverse course eastbound and 
proceed out of the Burbank radar service area.  Review of the radar data revealed that after the 
course reversal, the aircraft began a climb from 6,500 to 7,000 feet, then began a descent 
which continued to impact in the foothills immediately north of the greater Los Angeles Basin.  
The last recorded Mode C altitude information recorded for the aircraft was 3,400 feet.  The 
accident site is at 2,600 feet.
On the evening of the accident, a family member reported the  airplane overdue about 2308.  
Recorded radar data was obtained from the Burbank and Ontario Approach Control facilities.  
According to the data, the airplane was tracked back into the Ontario radar service area.  About 
2118:22, the aircraft was lost from radar contact in the vicinity of the accident site. 
PILOT INFORMATION
The personal pilot flight time records were not recovered.  According to Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) medical records, the pilot reported a total flight time of 2,200 hours, 
with 55 hours in the last 6 months, at his last third-class flight physical dated August 17, 1993.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION

According to logbook records, the last documented annual inspection was accomplished on 
June 22, 1993, at a recording tachometer time of 818.5 hours.  At that inspection, the total 
flight time for the airplane was annotated to be 1,978.93 hours. According to the engine 
logbook, the engine time since major overhaul was 182.29 hours.  At the accident site, the 
recording tachometer indicated 933.87 hours.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
The Brackett Field Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT), at LaVerne, California, located about 5 
miles south of the accident site, reported the last weather observation of the evening at 2046 
hours PDT:  2,500 feet scattered clouds; 4,000 feet scattered clouds; visibility 4 miles; fog and 
haze; wind 250 degrees at 5 knots; and, the altimeter was 30.00 inches of mercury.
The Ontario International Airport ATCT, Ontario, California, located about 13 miles southeast 
of the accident site and about 5 miles southeast of the accident airplane's departure/homebase 
airport, reported a scheduled weather observation at 2155 hours as:  weather clear; visibility 7 
miles; temperature 56 degrees Fahrenheit; dewpoint 53 degrees Fahrenheit; wind 260 degrees 
at 3 knots; and, the altimeter was 30.00 inches of mercury.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The accident site was located in the Angeles National Forest on Johnstone Peak, about 2,600 
feet mean sea level (msl).  The wreckage path was measured to be on an approximate 075 
degree magnetic bearing.  The wreckage path was through a ravine, densely covered by trees, 
on a descending path of about 10 degrees to the horizontal.
Both wings, horizontal stabilizers, vertical stabilizer, and rudder had been severed from the 
airframe and were strewn the length of the wreckage path, which was measured to be about 
150 feet in length. 
Examination of the No. 1 navigation/communication radio revealed that the communication 
frequency was on 123.0 MHz, and the navigation frequency was on 110.4 MHz.
Examination of the recording tachometer revealed an indicator needle imprint at 2,225 rpm. 
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
On May 5, 1994, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner performed an autopsy on the pilot.  
Specimens were obtained from the pilot during the autopsy for toxicological analysis by the 
FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
The results of the toxicological analysis conducted on the specimens were negative for carbon 
monoxide and cyanide.  The analysis was positive for the following drugs in the amounts listed:  
1) pseudoephedrine, 0.64 mg/L in blood, 0.15 mg/L in liver tissue; 2) promethazine, 3.4 mg/kg 
in liver tissue; and 3) brompheniramine, 3.0 mg/kg in liver tissue.  According to the CAMI 
toxicologists, the quantities of pseudoephedrine found in the blood sample were at therapeutic 
levels.  According to the FAA Western Pacific Regional Flight Surgeon's office, 
pseudoephedrine and brompheniramine are approved for use by pilots while flying, assuming 
there are no adverse side effects.  Promethazine is prohibited for use and is medically 
disqualifying.
According to the pilot's wife, he had a cold at the time of the accident.   
Prescription and nonprescription drug containers were found during the on-scene examination

of the wreckage.  A prescription container for pseudoephedrine with an expiration date of 
12/92 was found along with an over-the-counter nasal decongestant spray bottle.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
According to the FAA Air Traffic Control Handbook 7110.10K, Conduct of Abbreviated Briefing, 
paragraph 3-11.(a): "When a pilot requests specific information only, provide the requested 
information.  If adverse conditions are present or forecast, advise the pilot of this fact."
On January 9, 1995, the wreckage was released to the insurance company representative of the 
pilot.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
