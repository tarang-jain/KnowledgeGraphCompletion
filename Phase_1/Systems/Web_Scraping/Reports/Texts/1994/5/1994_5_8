Analysis 
Witnesses stated that the student pilot, who had no confirmed flight experience, assembled the 
aircraft on the day of the accident at the airport from a kit of preassembled major components. 
The pilot told the witnesses that he was going to perform some taxi tests and proceeded to do 
several taxi runs along the runway. The aircraft was then observed to line up on the runway, 
add what was described as full power, then takeoff. The witnesses said the aircraft leveled off 
about 30 feet above the runway and flew down the complete length of the pavement. Past the 
departure end of the runway, the aircraft abruptly pitched nose down and impacted the ground 
about 1,000 feet from the runway end. An FAA inspector reported that control system 
continuity was established throughout the aircraft during his examination. The witnesses 
reported that the engine sounds were consistent and strong up to the point of ground impact. A 
review of FAA system records revealed no evidence of a registration or airworthiness certificate 
application by the pilot. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to maintain control of the aircraft.  A factor in the accident was his complete 
lack of any flight experience or instruction.

Factual Information
 On May 1, 1994, at 1915 mountain standard time, a noncertificated and unregistered 
homebuilt Titan Tornado airplane collided with the ground near the Buckeye, Arizona, airport.  
The accident occurred during the first test flight following construction of the aircraft.  The 
aircraft was owned, constructed, and flown by the pilot.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed at the time and included calm winds.  The aircraft was destroyed in the ground 
collision sequence.  The pilot, who held a student pilot certificate and was the sole occupant, 
sustained fatal injuries.  The flight was originating at the time of the accident for a local test 
flight.
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness inspector from the Scottsdale, Arizona, 
Flight Standards District Office responded to the accident site where he examined the 
wreckage and interviewed witnesses.  The witnesses stated that the pilot, who had no 
confirmed flight experience, assembled the aircraft on the day of the accident at the airport 
from a kit of preassembled major components.  The pilot told the witnesses that he was going 
to perform some taxi tests and proceeded to do several taxi runs along the runway.  The aircraft 
was then observed to line up on the runway, add what was described as full power, then 
takeoff.  The witnesses said the aircraft leveled off about 30 feet above the runway and flew 
down the complete length of the pavement.  Past the departure end of the runway, the aircraft 
abruptly pitched nose down and impacted the ground about 1,000 feet from the runway end.
The inspector reported that control system continuity was established throughout the aircraft 
during his examination.  The witnesses reported that the engine sounds were consistent and 
strong up to the point of ground impact.
A review of FAA system records revealed no evidence of a registration or airworthiness 
certificate application by the pilot.
An autopsy and toxicological tests were performed by the Maricopa County Medical Examiner's 
Office.  The toxicological tests were negative for alcohol and screened drug substances.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
