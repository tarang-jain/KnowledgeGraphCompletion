Factual Information
 On January 2, 1994, at 1500 mountain standard time (MST), an Aeronca 7BCM, N4244A, 
collided with a tree just after lift-off from a field near Manila, Utah. The private pilot, who was 
the sole occupant of the aircraft, received minor injuries, and the aircraft sustained substantial 
damage. The personal pleasure flight, which was departing for Rock Springs, Wyoming, was 
being operated in visual meteorological conditions at the time of the accident. The pilot had not 
filed a flight plan, and the ELT, which was activated by the impact, was turned off at the scene.
According to the pilot, who was taking off from an 800 foot long open field, he was caught by a 
gust of quartering tailwind just after lift-off. The aircraft then experienced a decrease in 
airspeed and a significant decrease in rate of climb. This was followed by the aircraft impacting 
a tree situated just beyond the departure end of the field.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
