Factual Information
 On January 2, 1994, about 1030 central standard time, N3089J, a Cessna 150-E operated by 
the Wesley Flyers Club Inc. crashed near Raymond, Mississippi, while on a 14 CFR Part 91 
instructional flight. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight 
plan was filed. The airplane was substantially damaged and the instructor and student pilot 
received minor injuries. The flight originated about 20 minutes earlier.
     The instructor stated that he reduced the throttle, applied carburetor heat and the engine 
failed. He attempted a forced landing to a field and the airplane struck a stump on landing roll.  
Review of the operators manual for the Cessna 150 revealed, in the before landing checklist, 
that full carburetor heat is be applied before closing the throttle.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
