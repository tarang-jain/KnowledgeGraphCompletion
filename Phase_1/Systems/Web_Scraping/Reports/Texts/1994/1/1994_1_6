ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTOR PILOT, THE STUDENT PILOT MADE THREE GOOD 
LANDINGS. ON THE FOURTH LANDING, AS THE AIRPLANE STARTED ITS LANDING

Factual Information
 On January 2, 1994, at 1030 mountain standard time, a Cessna 140, N89036, was 
substantially damaged during landing at San Juan Pueblo Airport, Espanola, New Mexico.  The 
student pilot and flight instructor were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed 
for the instructional flight.
The instructor pilot reported that the student pilot made "three good landings."  She further 
reported that on the fourth landing, the airplane was straight, power was off, yoke was back, 
and the airplane touched down softly.  Almost as soon as the airplane started its landing roll, it 
veered to the right, departed the runway onto rough terrain, and came to rest in a ditch.  The 
instructor applied full left rudder, but it had no effect.  The instructor pilot could offer no 
reason why it veered right.
Examination of the aircraft revealed no mechanical or structural failures that could have 
caused the loss of directional control.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
