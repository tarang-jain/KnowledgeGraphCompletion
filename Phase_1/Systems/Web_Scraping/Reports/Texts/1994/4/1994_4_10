Factual Information
 On April 2, 1994, at 1415 eastern standard time, a Gulfstream American AA-5B, struck a 
snowbank during takeoff on runway 24 at Oneonta Municipal Airport, Oneonta, New York.  
The student pilot was not injured while the airplane sustained substantial damage.  The 
instructional flight was being operated under 14 CFR 91.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and a flight plan was not filed.
The pilot stated that during the takeoff roll as he was about to rotate, the airplane started to 
veer to the left.  He stated that he applied right rudder, but he was unsuccessful.  The pilot 
stated that he continued to apply right rudder and right brake, but the airplane continued to 
veer off the left side of the runway and struck a snowbank.  The pilot stated that he believed 
there was a problem with the left wheel or brake.
An FAA Aviation Safety Inspector examined the airplane after the accident and reported that 
there was no mechanical malfunction.  He stated that the winds at the time of the accident 
were 150 degrees at 14 knots gusting to 20 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
