Factual Information
 On April 2, 1994, about 1847 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-28-180, N4298Y was 
substantially damaged following a forced landing near Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Neither 
the private pilot nor his passenger were injured in the accident. The aircraft was being operated 
under 14 CFR Part 91 by the pilot. Visual meteorological conditions existed, and no flight plan 
had been filed for the personal flight. The flight departed Walnut Grove, North Carolina about 
1647.
The pilot reported that the engine began to run roughly, and he elected to attempt an 
emergency landing in a field. The aircraft struck a building prior to coming to rest in the field.
Examination of the aircraft revealed that the right fuel tank had one pint of fuel remaining in 
the tank. The left fuel tank had approximately 10 gallons of fuel remaining. The aircraft fuel 
tank selector was selected to the right fuel tank. The aircraft fuel line to the carburetor was dry, 
and the carburetor bowl was empty. The aircraft fuel pump was checked and was working 
properly. The aircraft fuel gages were checked, and were working properly.
A test run of the aircraft engine showed the engine to start easily, and operate normally at 
various speeds.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
