Factual Information
 On February 3, 1994, at 1530 central standard time, a Cessna 175, N7141M, struck a power 
pole and collided with terrain during a forced landing near the Paris, Arkansas, Municipal 
Airport.  The pilot received serious injuries and the aircraft sustained substantial damage.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the ferry flight.
According to information provided by witnesses, the aircraft was being ferried to Ozark, 
Arkansas, for repairs.  The airplane took off and the engine lost all power after takeoff at an 
altitude estimated to be between 200 and 300 feet above ground level (AGL).  The pilot said he 
attempted to return to the airport but stalled the aircraft and struck a utility pole during the 
emergency descent.
According to information supplied by the FAA inspector who went on scene, the aircraft had its 
last annual inspection in 1981, and had been sitting at the airport without use for 
approximately a year and a half.  He also provided information that the aircraft had flown 
about 30 hours in the last 13 years.
The FAA inspector stated that an annual inspection had been started on November 16, 1990, 
and that during that inspection, 36 safety of flight discrepancies had been found.  The annual 
was not completed and the pilot, who is not a licensed mechanic, said he repaired the necessary 
things and "it checked out good on the ground." 
The FAA inspector did not sample the fuel or conduct an internal examination of the engine; 
however, the attached photographs provide evidence of rust and algae growth in the fuel tanks.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
