Factual Information
 On February 3, 1994, at 0915 central standard time, a Cannon Starduster II, N21RC, sustained 
substantial damage during a forced landing due to a partial power loss.  The pilot was not 
injured, and visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  No flight plan was filed for this 
personal flight which was on initial climb following takeoff from Brazoria Air Park, Texas.
According to the pilot, pre takeoff checks were normal and the engine began running rough at 
approximately 150 feet above ground level.  The pilot said he could not land on the remaining 
runway and decided to land in an open field beside the airport.  The pilot stated that the 
landing was "hard" and caused damage to the propeller, firewall, right wing, and landing gear.
The engine was examined by an FAA inspector who found fuel tank sealant throughout the fuel 
feed system.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
