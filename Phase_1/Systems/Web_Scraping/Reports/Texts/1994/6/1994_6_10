Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The instructor and student had completed instrument instruction and afterwards, the student, 
who was a private pilot, requested and they practiced crosswind landings.  According to the 
instructor 'I was distracted by his perfomance and remiss in verification of fuel status in 
execution of before landing checklist.  Power was lost on climbout. Additional check futile. 
Committed to off-field landing.  Damage occurred on rollout through a ditch in terrain.' The 
FAA examined the airplane and revealed the left fuel tank was empty.  An undetermined 
amount of fuel was in the right tank. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's mismanagement of the fuel supply with an improper fuel selector position which 
resulted in fuel starvation and the loss of engine power.  A factor is the instructor's inadequate 
supervision of the flight.

Factual Information
 On June 2, 1994, about 1610 hours eastern daylight time, a Piper PA-24-260, N9041P, an 
instructional flight, forced landed in an open field after the engine lost power during takeoff 
climb from Orange County Airport, Montgomery, New York.  Visual meteorological conditions 
existed.  The certificated flight instructor received minor injuries; the student pilot was not 
injured.  The airplane was substantially damaged.  The local flight was conducted under 14 CFR 
Part 91.
The instructor was giving dual instrument instruction to the student who was a certificated 
private pilot.  According to the instructor, upon completion of the instructions, the student 
requested multiple landing practice in crosswind conditions.  The instructor stated, "I was 
distracted by his performance and remiss in verification of fuel status in execution of the before 
landing checklist.  Power was lost on climbout.  Additional check was futile.  Committed to off 
field landing.  Damage occurred on roll out through a ditch in terrain."
The FAA interviewed the instructor and student who indicated they were using and exhausted 
the fuel from the left tank.  According to the FAA, examination of the airplane revealed the left 
tank was empty.  An undetermined amount of fuel was in the right tank.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
