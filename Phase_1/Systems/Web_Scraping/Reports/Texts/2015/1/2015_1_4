Location:
Eustis, FL
Accident Number:
ERA15CA118
Date & Time:
01/02/2015, 1730 EST 
Registration:
N516VB
Aircraft:
DAYTON A BABCOCK STORM
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
At the conclusion of a local formation flight, the flight of weight-shift-control aircraft returned 
to their home airport and entered the traffic pattern. During the landing flare, the accident 
pilot encountered the "prop wash" of the preceding aircraft, which resulted in his aircraft 
entering an uncommanded right bank. The pilot attempted to counteract the turn by applying a 
left banking control input, but the left main landing gear and nose landing gear impacted the 
ground, and further aggravated the turn. The nose landing gear then collapsed and dug into the 
soft turf runway, and the aircraft overturned to the right, where it came to rest on its right side. 
Examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the 
airframe had been substantially damaged during the accident. The pilot reported that there 
were no mechanical malfunctions or failures or the aircraft that would have precluded normal 
operation, and when asked how the accident might have been prevented, the pilot stated, "–I 
could have performed (possibly) a go-around."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate spacing from the preceding aircraft during a formation 
landing, resulting in an inadvertent "prop wash" encounter, loss of control, and impact with 
terrain.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
