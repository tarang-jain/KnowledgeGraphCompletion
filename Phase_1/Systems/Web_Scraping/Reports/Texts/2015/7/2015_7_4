Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
During the second leg of a solo cross country flight, the student pilot reported that he became 
disoriented in mountainous terrain, and flew down a valley that he thought would lead him to 
his planned route. After entering the valley, the student pilot did not believe he had sufficient 
distance laterally to turn around, so he decided to initiate a climb to clear the ridge line in front 
of him. During the climb he heard the stall warning horn intermittently and realized he could 
not clear the ridge line ahead. The student pilot made an emergency landing into the rising 
terrain ahead of him and came to rest in the trees.  
During a postaccident interview, the student pilot reported that he didn't realize that he lacked 
the training and understanding for flight into mountainous terrain. The flight instructor who 
endorsed the student pilot's logbook for this route of flight reported that he should have 
provided "actual mountain flying training prior to a solo flight over mountainous terrain." 
The student pilot stated there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. The left wing and fuselage were substantially 
damaged.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's disorientation in mountainous terrain and course deviation into a canyon, 
which resulted in the airplane's inability to out climb terrain and a forced landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
