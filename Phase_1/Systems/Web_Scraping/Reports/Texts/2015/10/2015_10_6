Analysis 
The examination of the engine confirmed that there were three holes in the LPT case. But the 
holes were under the LPT cooling air manifolds and plenum that did not have any damage. In 
addition, there was no damage to the inside of the engine's cowlings nor did any debris fall out 
when the cowlings were opened. There was no damage to the LPT cooling air manifolds and 
plenum that were over the holes and was there was no debris in the cowlings indicating that no 
debris passed through the LPT case that made this a contained event rather than uncontained.
The disassembly of the engine revealed one 3rd stage turbine vane cluster, No. 29, was missing 
although the cluster's bolt hole tab with the retaining nut were still in place on the inner 
transition duct. The missing cluster's inner shroud was found in the bottom of the engine in the 
path of the 3rd stage turbine blades. The metallurgical examination of the inner shroud 
revealed fatigue, however the full extent of the fatigue could not be determined because the end 
of the fracture surface was smeared. 
The examination of the remainder of the LPT revealed all the other turbine vane clusters were 
complete and in place or the inner and outer shrouds were in place with just the airfoils 
missing. All the LPT blades were fractured and the fracture surfaces were coarse and grainy 
indicating an overload fracture. The examination of the remainder of the engine between the 
fan and high-pressure turbine did not reveal any damage. The extensive damage to the LPT 
and the absence of damage throughout the remainder of the engine indicated that the damage 
to the engine originated within the LPT. 
The visual examination and a dimensional inspection of the LPT case revealed the 3rd stage 
turbine vane hooks had extensive wear that varied significantly between adjacent hooks. The 
dimensional inspection revealed the hook for 3rd stage turbine vane cluster No. 29, the missing 
vane cluster, had the most wear and that wear was tapered. The tapered wear on the hook and 
indicates that the vane cluster's outer foot disengaged from the LPT case and tilted rearward. It 
was not possible to determine the cause of the tapered wear on the LPT case vane hook that led 
to the vane cluster disengaging. The finding of fatigue on the inner shroud further supports 
Page 2 of 12ENG16IA001
that the vane cluster's outer foot disengaged from the LPT case initially and fatigue was caused 
by either the transfer of the loads to the inner shroud or from the cluster being strummed by 
the passing 3rd stage turbine blades. 
The review of the engine's maintenance showed that it had last been overhauled in October 
2005 and since accumulated 35,545 hours and 3,532 cycles of service. Although the engine was 
overhauled in October 2005, the LPT module's maintenance records show that it had been 
swapped from another engine and accumulated 17,441 hours and 2,184 cycles since its previous 
overhaul. So, at that time of event, the LPT module accumulated 52,986 hours and 6,546 cycles 
since it had been last overhauled. Except for the low cycle fatigue life limits for specific rotating 
parts that are outlined in the engine manual, there is no prohibition for an engine or LPT 
module to have operated as long as this module had been in service. The review of the LPT 
module's maintenance records from the previous overhaul show that the LPT case modification 
to the anti-rotation slots had been previously complied with. In addition, the records show that 
the modification to the 3rd stage turbine vane clusters to remove material from the outer 
platform gussets had been complied with as well. Because of previous contained and 
uncontained PW4000 LPT events, P&W has revised the engine manual to add extensive 
inspections and repairs to LPT components as well as limiting the number of strip and recoat 
repairs that can be done to PW4000 LPT airfoils. The inspections and repairs that were 
subsequently adopted into an airworthiness directive (AD) included a visual and dimensional 
inspection of the LPT case's vane hooks. The tapered wear that was noted on the LPT case's 3rd 
stage turbine vane hooks occurred over time. The records do not list any work on the LPT 
case's vane hooks at the last overhaul, so it cannot be determined if the wear that resulted in 
the disengagement of the 3rd stage turbine vane cluster had existed only from the last overhaul 
or had existed prior to that overhaul. However, the revised inspection and repair procedures 
that are now mandated by an AD likely would have captured the wear and required it to be 
repaired or the case replaced.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
The PW4056 engine experienced an in-flight loss of power because of damage to the low-
pressure turbine (LPT) because of the inadequate overhaul inspection and repair instructions 
that existed at the time of the LPT module's last overhaul. A vane hook in the LPT case wore to 
the point to allow a 3rd stage turbine vane cluster to disengage and eventually fall into the path 
of the 3rd stage turbine blades causing extensive downstream damage to the LPT module.

Loss of engine power (partial) (Defining event)
Engine shutdown
On October 2, 2015, at about 0510 UTC, a Boeing 747-451 airplane, N662US, operated by Delta 
Air Lines as flight 158, experienced a loss of power from the No. 3 engine, a Pratt & Whitney 
(P&W) PW4056, while in cruise flight at FL330. About 3:40 hours after taking off from 
Incheon International Airport (ICN), Seoul, Korea, while operating in Russian airspace on the 
B241 airway near the GITRU navigation fix, the pilots reported hearing a loud bang that was 
followed by the No. 3 engine's N1 rpm decreasing while the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) 
increased. The pilots shutdown the No. 3 engine and declared an emergency with Russian air 
traffic control in addition to requesting a descent to FL290. The pilots contacted the dispatcher 
at Atlanta and discussed options for diverting. The pilots considered diverting to Seattle, but 
the weather for their expected arrival time was forecast to be 800 foot overcast and 2 miles 
visibility. The weather forecast for Tokyo, Japan was scattered clouds and 25 miles visibility. 
The airplane diverted to Tokyo-Narita International Airport (NRT), where it made a 3-engine 
landing without further incident. The airplane was operating on an instrument flight rules 
flight plan under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as an international 
passenger flight from ICN to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW), Detroit, 
Michigan.

Airplane Information
The airplane was a Boeing 747-451, serial number (SN) 23720, registered as N662US, and 
operated by Delta Air Lines. The Boeing 747-451 airplane is a four-engine transport category 
airplane. The airplane has a maximum takeoff gross weight of 873,000 pounds and the 
airplane's takeoff weight from ICN was 837,600 pounds. The airplane was loaded with 49,120 
gallons of fuel. The airplane was manufactured in 1988 and was originally delivered to 
Northwest Airlines. Delta Air Lines acquired the airplane in the merger with Northwest 
Airlines. According to Delta Air Lines' records, at the time of the incident, the airplane had 
Page 5 of 12ENG16IA001
accumulated 109,167 hours of flying time.
The No. 3 engine was a PW4056, SN P717530. The PW4056 is a dual-spool, axial-flow, high-
bypass turbofan engine that features a 1-stage 94-inch diameter fan, a 4-stage low-pressure 
compressor (LPC), an 11-stage high-pressure compressor (HPC), annular combustor, a 2-stage 
high-pressure turbine (HPT) that drives the HPC, and a 4-stage LPT that drives the fan and 
LPC. The PW4056 engine has a takeoff thrust rating of 56,750 pounds, flat-rated to 92°F 
(33°C). When the PW4056 engine is installed on a Boeing 747 airplane, it has a maximum 
continuous thrust rating of 47,970 pounds, flat-rated to 86°F (30°C). The PW4056 engine can 
also be installed on a Boeing 767 airplane where it has a maximum continuous thrust rating of 
49.530 pounds, flat-rated to 77°F (25°C). According to Delta Air Lines' maintenance records, 
engine SN 717530 had accumulated 94,778 hours and 11,814 cycles since new, 35,545 hours 
and 4,362 cycles since the last heavy maintenance, and 29,194 hours and 3,532 cycles since the 
last shop visit. The last heavy maintenance on the engine was accomplished in 2005 at P&W's 
Cheshire Engine Center, Cheshire, Connecticut. P&W's Cheshire Engine Center was an FAA-
certificated repair station that ceased operations in 2011.
The LPT module was SN D17579. According to Delta Air Lines' maintenance records, LPT 
module SN D17579 had accumulated 95,180 hours and 11,623 cycles since new and 52,986 
hours and 11,623 cycles since the last heavy maintenance, which had been accomplished at the 
Cheshire Engine Center in 2005. Engine 717530 had been received at Cheshire with LPT 
module SN D17531 installed. The records show that Cheshire swapped out LPT module D17531 
for D17579 from Northwest Airlines PW4056 engine P717684 to expedite the engine build. The 
records further show that at the time LPT module D17579 was installed in engine P717530, it 
had already accumulated 59,635 hours and 7,261 cycles since new and 17,441 hours and 2,184 
cycles since the last heavy maintenance.

board.
Damage to Airplane
The airplane sustained minor damage in the forms of nicks and dents to the underside of the 
right wing and inboard aileron as well as to the leading edge of the right horizontal stabilizer.
There was no damage to the inside of the No. 3 engine's nacelle.
Other Damage
There was no other damage reported.
Flight Recorders
The airplane was equipped with a cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and a digital flight data 
recorder(DFDR), which was returned to the NTSB's Recorder Laboratory for readout. The CVR 
was not removed from the airplane for readout because of the elapsed time from when the 
event occurred to when the airplane landed at NRT would have resulted in the event being 
overwritten. 
The DFDR recorded data for the incident flight as well as five previous flights. The DFDR data 
for the incident flight shows the No. 3 engine was started around subframe reference number 
(SRN, each subframe is equal to 1 second) that was followed 2 seconds later by the No. 4 engine 
being started. At around SRN 157079, both the No. 3 and 4 engines stabilized at idle power. 
Around 157080 and 157090, the Nos. 2 and 1 engines, respectively, were started with the No. 1 
engine stabilizing at idle around SRN 157184 and the No. 2 engine stabilized at idle around 
SRN 157195. The DFDR recorded the following engine performance parameters: engine 
pressure ratio (EPR), which is a measure of engine power based on ratio of pressure of the 
exhaust gas in the tailpipe in comparison to the pressure of the air entering the inlet; high 
pressure rotor speed (N2) in percent; EGT in degrees Celsius (°C), and fuel flow (Wf) in pounds 
per hour (pph)/
Page 8 of 12ENG16IA001
After the engines had started and were stabilized at idle power, the engine's performance 
parameters were:
Engine power, stabilized idle power after start
No. 1: EPR Œ 1.014, N2 - 66 %, EGT - 350°C, Wf - 1,696 pph
No. 2: EPR Œ 1.023, N2 Œ 66 %, EGT - 343°C, Wf Œ 1,664 pph
No. 3: EPR Œ 1.016, N2 Œ 66 %, EGT Œ 368°C, Wf Œ 1,952 pph
No. 4: EPR Œ 1.016, N2 Œ 66 %, EGT Œ 346°C, Wf Œ 1,824 pph
Between about SRN 157184 and 157672, the Nos. 1 and 4 engine performance parameters: 
EPR, N2, EGT, and fuel flow intermittently increased and decreased consistent with the 
airplane taxiing from the ramp out to the runway. Around SRN 157673, the engines' 
performance parameters began to increase with the No. 3 engine's parameters lagging those of 
the other three engines by about 2 percent N2. At around SRN 157683, the engines stabilized at 
takeoff power and the airplane had begun to accelerate. The airplane lifted off at around SRN 
157726 at an airspeed of around 184 knots. 
During takeoff, the engines' performance parameters were:
Engine power at takeoff 
No. 1: EPR Œ 1.498, N2 - 98 %, EGT - 562°C, Wf Œ 21,856 pph
No. 2: EPR Œ 1.498, N2 Œ 98 %, EGT - 556°C, Wf Œ 21,248 pph
No. 3: EPR Œ 1.500, N2 Œ 97 %, EGT Œ 595°C, Wf Œ 22,048 pph
No. 4: EPR Œ 1,500, N2 Œ 98 %, EGT Œ464°C, Wf Œ 21,281 pph
At around SRN 158451, the airplane climbed through FL 180 and all four engines were at an 
EPR of 1.408. The engines' performance parameters in the climb through FL180 were:
Engine power at FL 180
No. 1: EPR Œ 1.408, N2 - 96 %, EGT - 506°C, Wf Œ 13,344 pph
No. 2: EPR Œ 1.408, N2 Œ 95 %, EGT - 492°C, Wf Œ 12,800 pph
No. 3: EPR Œ 1.408, N2 Œ95 %, EGT Œ 542°C, Wf Œ 13,888 pph
No. 4: EPR Œ 1.408, N2 Œ 95 %, EGT Œ 505°C, Wf Œ 13,280 pph
The airplane leveled off at FL 330 at around SRN 159399. Around SRN 159699, about 5 
minutes after the airplane had leveled off at FL 330, all four engines were at an EPR of 1.363. 
The engines' performance parameters at FL330 were:
Page 9 of 12ENG16IA001
Engine power at FL 330
No. 1: EPR Œ 1.363, N2 - 94 %, EGT - 459°C, Wf Œ 7,488 pph
No. 2: EPR Œ 1.363, N2 Œ 93 %, EGT - 449°C, Wf Œ 7,206 pph
No. 3: EPR Œ 1.363, N2 Œ 92 %, EGT Œ 491°C, Wf Œ 7,964 pph
No. 4: EPR Œ 1.363, N2 Œ 93 %, EGT Œ 461°C, Wf Œ 7,552 pph
Between about SRN 159699 and 170166 while the airplane continued to maintain FL 330, the 
engines' EPRs and N2 speeds varied in unison between 1.273 and 1.359 and 91 and 93 percent, 
respectively. The engines' EGT and Wf also varied in unison with the EPR and N2 speed.
At around SRN 170166, the No.3 engine's performance indications were: EPR 1.281, N2 91 
percent, EGT 458°C, and Wf 7,022 pph. At around SRN 170167, with the EPR remaining at 
1.281 and N2 at 91 percent, the EGT began to increase and the fuel flow began to decrease. The 
EGT continued to increase until around SRN 170813 when it peaked at 659°C before it began to 
decrease. Concurrently, the EPR decreased from 1.297 to 0.92 in 2 seconds, the N2 began to 
decrease from 92%, and the Wf continued to decrease. At around SRN 170199, while the EPR 
was at 0.631 and the N2 and EGT continued to decrease, the Wf began to increase from 3,520 
to 18,144 pph in 4 seconds before decreasing down to zero in the next 6 seconds. There was no 
increase in the N2 rpm or EGT associated with the increase in Wf.
The DFDR contained data from five previous flights. The data show that No. 3 engine's 
performance indications were comparable to those of the other three engines. 
Fire
There was no fire damage.
Tests and Research
The engine was removed from the airplane and shipped to Delta's Technical Operations Center, 
Atlanta, Georgia for disassembly and examination in the presence of the Powerplants Group. 
The disassembly revealed one 3rd stage turbine vane cluster, No. 29 that was located at about 8 
o'clock, was missing. (Photo No. 1) A portion of the missing vane cluster's inner shroud was 
found at the bottom of the engine in the 3rd stage turbine blades' plane of rotation. (Photo No. 
2) The piece of the 3rd stage turbine vane cluster inner shroud had three circumferential 
grooves that corresponded to the geometry of the 3rd stage turbine rotating inner air seal.

Although the vane cluster was missing, the cluster's bolt hole tab with the nut remained in 
place attached to the inner transition duct. (Photo No. 3) During the disassembly of the 3rd 
stage turbine vane area, the torque on the retaining nuts were checked and all including that 
for the missing vane cluster were found to be tight.
Photo No. 3: Close up of the bolt hole tab with the retaining nut in place for the 
No. 29 3rd stage turbine vane cluster. (P&W)
The remaining 3rd stage turbine vane clusters' were all in place and the airfoils were heavily 
battered with nicks and dents on the trailing edges. (Refer to Photo No. 2) 
The LPT case with the inner transition ducts and all of the 3rd stage turbine vane clusters 
including the No. 29 vane cluster inner shroud fragment were sent to P&W, East Hartford, 
Connecticut for metallurgical examination and dimensional inspections that were 
accomplished under NTSB oversight. The metallurgical examination of the No. 29 3rd stage 
turbine vane cluster's inner shroud revealed remnants of fatigue on the counterclockwise side 
of the forward flange. The fatigue had progressed forward from multiple origins along the aft 
surface of the flange to a maximum depth of 0.026 inches. The fracture surface beyond the 
fatigue was smeared, so it could not be determined if the fatigue had progressed further. The 
examination of the fragment also revealed two wear patterns that were consistent with contact 
with the No. 28 3rd stage turbine vane cluster in the normal installed position as well as having 
moved out of position. The dimensional inspection of the LPT case revealed wear on the 3rd 
stage turbine vane cluster hooks with the most extensive wear that was also tapered being on 
the hook for the No. 29 cluster. The examination of the No. 29 inner transition duct revealed 
wear patterns from the No. 29 3rd stage turbine vane cluster that were consistent with the 
cluster having moved inward and aft.

The initial report of this event from NRT was that it was an uncontained LPT event because 
there were several holes in the LPT case. The examination of the LPT case confirmed that there 
were three small holes, largest about 0.69 x 0.44 inches, in the LPT case, all under the LPT case 
cooling air tubes. The examination of the cooling air tubes did not show any impact damage 
and it was reported from NRT that there was no damage to the inside of the No. 3 engine 
cowling nor did any debris fall out of the cowling when it was opened.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=92117
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
