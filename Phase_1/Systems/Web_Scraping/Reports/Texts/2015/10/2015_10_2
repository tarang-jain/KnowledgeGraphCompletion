Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Avalon, CA
Accident Number:
GAA16CA002
Date & Time:
10/01/2015, 1600 PDT 
Registration:
N4286Q
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that during his first approach to land he elected to go-around due to the crab 
angle and buffeting. On the second approach, he encountered downdrafts and moderate 
turbulence again on short final and applied power to go-around. During the go-around, the 
airplane continued to sink and impacted a cliff about 250 feet short of the runway threshold, 
and ultimately came to rest at the bottom of the cliff near a road. The fuselage and both wings 
sustained substantial damage.
According to the airport manager, when the airplane was on final approach he announced on 
the common traffic advisory frequency, "wind 250 at 11 and use caution for down drafts and 
turbulence on short final." The accident pilot acknowledged the transmission. The airport 
manager continued to observe the airplane and witnessed the pitch angle continuously increase 
on final approach, and then he heard the engine power increase. Subsequently, the airport 
manager witnessed the airplane "stall" and "fall from view."  
The pilot reported there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation. 
  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the critical angle of attack in turbulent and downdraft conditions, 
which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and collision with terrain on final approach.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
