Substantial
Defining Event:
Hard landing

4 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that he was landing the airplane in turbulent conditions with gusting wind. 
He stated that during the landing flare, the airplane encountered an updraft, followed 
immediately by a downdraft. The airplane subsequently impacted the runway and the nose 
landing gear collapsed, resulting in substantial damage to the engine firewall. The pilot 
reported there were no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies of the airplane that would have 
precluded normal operation. Review of archived weather information for the accident airport 
about the time of the accident revealed variable wind at 9 knots with gusts to 19 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to compensate for gusty wind conditions during the landing flare, which 
resulted in a hard landing and subsequent nose landing gear collapse.
Findings
Aircraft
Landing flare - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Lack of action - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
