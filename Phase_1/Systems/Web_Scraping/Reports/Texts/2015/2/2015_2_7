Analysis   
After departing from the airport where the pilot kept the gyroplane, he flew to his family farm 
and landed without incident on a 1,500-foot-long grass polo field. Later on, during an 
attempted takeoff from the same field, when the gyroplane was traveling at 25 to 30 knots and 
was about 150 feet into the takeoff roll, the gyroplane rose to a balanced position on its main 
wheels, but then began to bounce up and down violently. The pilot then lost control of the 
gyroplane and it rolled over on its left side about 300 feet into the takeoff roll. The pilot 
advised that there was nothing mechanically wrong with the gyroplane. He further advised that 
it was "pilot error" and that he had "over advanced" the blades by pushing the control stick too 
far forward and that the blades were not yet at speed (too low a rotor rpm) when he did it. The 
pilot was not injured, but the gyroplane incurred damage to the rotor blades, the pusher 
propeller, the horizontal stabilizer, the vertical stabilizer, the rudder, the engine cowling, and 
the wheel pants.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper control inputs which resulted in a loss of control and rollover during the 
takeoff roll.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
