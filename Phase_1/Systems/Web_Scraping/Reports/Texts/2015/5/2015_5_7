CEN15CA223
Date & Time:

Registration:
N98656
Aircraft:
PIPER J3C-65

Substantial
Defining Event:
Ground collision

1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot, who was in the rear tandem seat of the tailwheel airplane, had just landed and was 
taxing to the fuel pumps to refuel. He did not see the parked Beech A36 over the nose of his 
airplane and collided with the right wing of N4678A. The pilot said the accident could have 
been prevented if he had followed the taxi line on the tarmac. He also blamed his "less than 
effective brakes" that didn't help as he tried to control the airplane in the wind. This caused his 
attention to be diverted and he lost sight of the surrounding obstructions. The pilot had logged 
a total of 82 flight hours, of which 13 hours were in the accident airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of positional awareness while taxiing, resulting in a collision with a parked and 
unoccupied airplane. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's difficulty seeing over the nose 
of the airplane, his preoccupation with trying to control the airplane in the wind, and his 
minimal experience in the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
