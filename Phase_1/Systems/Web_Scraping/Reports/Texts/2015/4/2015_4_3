Location:
Middleton, WI
Accident Number:
GAA15CA033
Date & Time:
04/01/2015, 1520 CDT 
Registration:
N777XX
Aircraft:
LANCAIR COMPANY LC 40 550FG
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
During a cross-country flight the pilot said he listened to the automated weather report a few 
miles west of his destination and noted crosswinds at 17 knots, gusting to 20 knots.  The pilot 
continued the approach to landing and reported the touchdown was "uneventful," but during 
the landing roll a gust of wind rotated the nose 90 degrees into the crosswind.  Subsequently, 
the airplane departed the runway surface and impacted a ditch adjacent to the runway, causing 
the nose wheel to collapse.  The pilot reported no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.  
Examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the engine firewall.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing. Contributing to the accident 
was the pilot's inadequate compensation for the crosswind during landing.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Crosswind - Response/compensation (Factor)
Sloped/uneven terrain - Contributed to outcome

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
