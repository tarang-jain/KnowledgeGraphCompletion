Analysis   
The pilot reported that he was landing his airplane at night and mistook the hangar lights for 
runway lights. The airplane struck trees on the final approach, then the ground before coming 
to rest, inverted. The pilot said that, in retrospect, he was on the incorrect radio frequency 
when he attempted to turn on the pilot-activated runway lights. A Federal Aviation 
Administration inspector examined the wreckage and reported that the airplane sustained 
substantial damage. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical problems with the 
airplane at the time of the accident. The runway lights operated normally after the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's use of an incorrect radio frequency when attempting to turn on the runway lights, 
resulting is an attempt to land the airplane while aligned with airport hangar lights.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
