Analysis   
The pilot stated that the balloon flight was normal with light and variable wind conditions. The 
pilot stated she informed the passenger that the basket may "hop" a couple of times during the 
landing and told him to brace himself. When the balloon basket touched the ground, the pilot's 
foot became wedged between the sidewall of the basket and one of the fuel tanks. The pilot lost 
her balance, her body shifted, and she felt her ankle fracture. She told the passenger to 
continue pulling the deflation line. The envelope deflated quickly and the basket laid down 
onto its side. There was no damage to the envelope or basket. The pilot suffered a broken ankle 
and leg.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=91718
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
