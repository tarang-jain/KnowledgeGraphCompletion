Location:
Chicago, IL
Accident Number:
CEN16LA052
Date & Time:
11/02/2015, 1925 CST 
Registration:
N732MD
Aircraft:
CESSNA 208B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Abrupt maneuver
Injuries:
9 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Scheduled
Analysis 
After landing in night visual meteorological conditions, the commuter flight proceeded to taxi 
to the ramp. Upon coming to a service road perpendicular to the taxiway, a vehicle moved 
directly across the airplane's taxi path. The flight crew immediately applied brakes to stop. 
While braking, the airplane's tail rocked aft and struck the ground. The flight crew contacted 
ground control to inform them about the vehicle incident and resumed taxi to the ramp, and 
the driver of the vehicle radioed the tower, informing them that he had cut off an aircraft. An 
inspection of the airplane by the operator revealed structural damage to the aft pressure 
bulkhead resulting from the tail strike.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the driver of the service vehicle to yield to the taxiing airplane, which resulted in 
a near-collision and tail strike. 
Findings
Personnel issues
Incorrect action performance - Ground crew (Cause)
Environmental issues
Dark - Not specified

Factual Information
On November 2, 2015, about 1925 central standard time, a Cessna 208 Caravan, N732MD, 
registered to Multi-Aero Inc., of Sarasota, Florida, and doing business as Air Choice One of St. 
Louis, Missouri, was substantially damaged during taxi after braking to avoid a ground vehicle 
at the Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD). The pilot, co-pilot, and seven passengers 
were not injured. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed. The flight was being 
operated as a commuter passenger flight under the provisions of 
Federal Code of Regulations 
Part 135
. The flight had originated from Ironwood, Michigan (IWD), and ORD was its final 
destination.
After landing on Runway 27 at ORD, the flight crew proceeded to taxi to the ramp via Taxiway 
R. Upon coming to a service road perpendicular to the taxiway, a vehicle moved directly across 
their taxi path. The flight crew immediately applied brakes to stop. While braking, the 
airplane's tail section stuck the ground before stabilizing back to a normal stance on the 
landing gear. The flight crew contacted ground control to inform them about the vehicle 
incident and resumed taxi to the ramp.
According to a report by the FAA inspector who responded to the accident scene, the driver of 
the service vehicle (OPS 11) had radioed the tower on frequency 120.75. The driver stated that 
he just cut off an aircraft on taxiway R. A few minutes later, the driver radioed on frequency 
129.9 and reported that he was sorry. Both the pilot-in-command, and the first officer reported 
that they were cut off by the service vehicle and stopped the aircraft immediately to avoid 
collision.
A special fight permit was issued by the FAA to ferry the aircraft
 
from ORD to the company 
repair facility in St. Louis, Missouri, to accomplish repairs. As reported on NTSB Form 6120, 
a
n inspection of the airplane by the operator revealed structural damage to the aft pressure 
bulkhead.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=92399
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
