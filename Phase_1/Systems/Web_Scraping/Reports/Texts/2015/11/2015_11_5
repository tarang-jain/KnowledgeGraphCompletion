11/02/2015, 0745 CST 
Registration:
N33939
Aircraft:
TAYLORCRAFT BC12 65
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
According to the pilot, immediately after takeoff, the wind speed increased and he elected to 
complete one pattern and land. With a right quartering head wind, the pilot touched down yet 
reported that a wind gust made the airplane veer to the right side of the runway. He recalled 
that he applied full power and aborted the landing. The pilot reported that when he "looked out 
of the windshield", he realized the airplane was on a heading to impact the airfield hangars, so 
he turned the airplane to the left, the airplane stalled and impacted the ground. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage to the right wing strut and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical failures or anomalies prior to or during the 
flight that would have prevented normal flight operation.
The wind at the nearest weather reporting station reported wind from 210 degrees true at 7 
knots, with no gusts, and the departure runway heading was 14.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack, resulting in an inadvertent 
aerodynamic stall and impact with terrain.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
