Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The pilot-receiving-instruction reported that the purpose of the flight was to receive a checkout 
in the flying club airplane. After completing three uneventful takeoffs and landings, the flight 
instructor asked the pilot-receiving-instruction to perform a simulated soft-field takeoff from a 
high-altitude airport. The pilot-receiving-instruction had not performed the requested 
maneuver previously, which was described as a soft-field takeoff at 50-percent engine power to 
simulate the atmospheric conditions of a high-altitude airport. Before attempting the takeoff, 
both pilots agreed that the pilot-receiving-instruction would manipulate the flight controls and 
that the throttle would be separately controlled by the flight instructor. The pilot-receiving-
instruction reported that during the takeoff, shortly after becoming airborne, while still in 
ground-effect, the airplane encountered an aerodynamic stall. The pilot-receiving-instruction 
briefly reduced airplane pitch to recover from the aerodynamic stall, but as the airplane drifted 
toward the right side of the runway he subsequently increased yoke backpressure to keep the 
airplane airborne. The pilot-receiving-instruction reported that the airplane encountered a 
second aerodynamic stall after he increased airplane pitch. The airplane subsequently drifted 
left, crossing back over the runway, before the airplane landed along the left side of the runway. 
The flight was terminated and the aircraft inspected for damage. The airplane exhibited 
damage to the tail skid, tail tie-down ring, left wingtip, the nose and left main landing gear, and 
the propeller. An additional examination established that the aft fuselage bulkhead had 
sustained substantial damage when the tail struck the runway. The pilot-receiving-instruction 
reported there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or engine that 
would have precluded normal operation.
The flight instructor reported that the engine power had been set at 2,100 rpm to simulate the 
available engine power while operating at a high-altitude airport. He reported that the pilot-
receiving-instruction had used excessive pitch control inputs during the initial takeoff roll to 
keep the nose wheel off the runway, the airplane veered to the right before coming airborne, 
and that the airplane encountered an aerodynamic stall upon liftoff. The flight instructor 
reported that the airplane subsequently bounced, drifted to the left, and eventually landed 
along the left side of the runway.

The flight crew's decision to have the flight instructor separately control the throttle during the 
accident takeoff likely prevented the pilot-receiving-instruction from adequately recovering 
from the initial aerodynamic stall. Additionally, following the initial aerodynamic stall, there 
was likely inadequate coordination between the flight crew to reestablish control of the 
airplane before it impacted the ground.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot-receiving-instruction's excessive pitch control during takeoff, which resulted in an 
aerodynamic stall shortly after liftoff and the subsequent loss of control. Contributing to the 
accident was the flight crew's decision to have the flight instructor separately control the 
throttle while the pilot-receiving-instruction manipulated the flight controls, which resulted in 
inadequate coordination between the flight crew during the attempted stall recovery.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=90833
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
