Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Redmond, OR
Accident Number:
WPR15LA137
Date & Time:
03/01/2015, 0940 PST 
Registration:
N9133G
Aircraft:
PIPER PA 46-310P
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot reported that, about 30 minutes into the private, cross-country flight and 
while the airplane was cruising at 23,000 ft mean sea level, the engine started running roughly. 
The pilot noticed that the No. 5 cylinder head temperature (CHT) was lower than normal. He 
cycled the magnetos and noticed that the engine ran rougher than normal when the left 
magneto was selected. He then enriched the mixture, and the engine smoothed out. He 
continued to monitor the engine and adjust the mixture. About 30 minutes later, the engine 
lost power. The pilot diverted to a nearby airport and attempted to line up for a runway but did 
not have sufficient altitude. He performed a forced landing to the airport infield, which 
resulted in the nose landing gear collapsing and structural damage to the wing spar. 
Postaccident examination of the engine did not reveal any anomalies that would have 
precluded normal operation. During an engine test run up to full power, the only anomaly 
noted was that the No. 5 CHT was 50 to 70° lower than all the other cylinders. However, the 
lower CHT likely would not cause a loss of engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power during cruise flight for reasons that could not be determined because 
postaccident examination of the engine did not reveal any anomalies that would have 
precluded normal operation.

Factual Information
On March 1, 2015, at 0940 Pacific standard time, a Piper PA-46-310P, N9133G, executed a 
forced landing into Roberts Field Airport, Redmond, Oregon, after a loss of engine power. The 
airplane was registered to, and operated by, the private pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of 
Federal Regulations, Part 91. The pilot was not injured, and the airplane sustained substantial 
damage to both wings. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight 
plan had been filed. The flight originated from Oak Harbor, Washington, at 0800.
The pilot reported that he was cruising at 23,000 feet mean sea level (msl) when he noticed the 
engine running a bit rough as he passed Portland, Oregon. He noticed that the number 5 
cylinder head temperature (cht) was lower than normal. The pilot cycled the magnetos and 
noticed that the engine ran rougher than normal when the left magneto was selected. The 
engine smoothed out when he enriched the mixture. He continued to monitor the engine and 
adjusting the mixture. About 30 minutes later engine power completely dropped off. The pilot 
diverted to Roberts Field, Redmond, Oregon, using his GPS for navigation. About 2 miles out 
he acquired the airport visually, and attempted to line up for a runway but did not have enough 
altitude. He performed a forced landing into the airport infield. The landing resulted in a 
collapsed nose landing gear, and wing spar damage at both main landing gear mounts.
On March 3, 2015, an airframe and power plants (A&P) mechanic examined the airplane under 
the supervision of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector. He reported on the 
airframe structural damage, and that he found no obvious reason for the loss of engine power. 
The airplane was then relocated to a facility in Greeley, Colorado, for further examination.
The airplane was equipped with a EDM 930 engine data monitoring system. On April 14 the 
data from the EDM 930 was downloaded and sent to the NTSB Investigator-in-Charge (IIC). 
The data showed that about 25 minutes before the loss of engine power the number 5 cylinder 
head temperature (cht) started to trend about 50°F below its previous steady temperature 
(300°F), and then fluctuate twice between 300°F Œ 250°F during the last 12 minutes. The 
exhaust gas temperature (egt) remained steady for cylinder number 5 throughout the record. 
All the remaining cylinders exhibited steady egt and cht values.
On May 13, 2015, the NTSB IIC, and a technical representative from the engine manufacturer 
examined the airplane. A fuel sample was taken from the fuel strainer. The fuel sample was 
light green in color and tested negative for water or kerosene/jet fuel contamination. Results of 
a chemical analysis confirmed that the sample was chemically consistent with 100LL avgas. 
The engine was examined externally, the cylinders bore scoped, sparkplugs inspected, internal 
magneto timing verified, and internal continuity confirmed by rotating the 
propeller/crankshaft. The number 5 cylinder fuel injection nozzle was removed, examined, and 
found to be in good condition with no blockages. An external fuel tank was plumbed into the 
right-wing fuel outlet and an external priming pump placed inline. The engine started on the 
first attempt, ran smoothly at idle, magneto checked performed, and the engine was run up to 
red line producing full power. No anomalies were noted during the engine run other than that 
the number 5 cylinder head temperature was notably 50°-70°F cooler than all the other 
cylinders.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
