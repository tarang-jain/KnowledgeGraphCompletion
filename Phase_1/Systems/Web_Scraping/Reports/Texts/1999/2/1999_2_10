Analysis 
The pilot stated that after flying for 2.5 hours, he decided to land at an airport near Champaign, 
Illinois, and missed the airport due to the wind.  The pilot stated that he then diverted to

the airplane ran out of fuel and he declared an emergency.  An off airport landing was made 
into a plowed farm field 2.5 miles west of the Paxton Airport. The forced landing was made on 
a heading of 020 degrees.  A weather report for a reporting station located 27 nautical miles 
and 190 degrees from the accident site reported winds from 180 degrees at 20 knots gusting to 
26 knots.  The left wing fuel tank contained no fuel and the right wing fuel tank contained less

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
