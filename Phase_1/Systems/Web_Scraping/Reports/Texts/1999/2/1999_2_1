Analysis 
The helicopter's tail rotor made contact with the offshore platform's windsock during final 
approach to landing.  The pilot heard a buzzing sound followed by a right yaw.  He then 
executed a hovering autorotation to the platform. Inspection of the windsock support frame 
showed signs of tail rotor impact damage. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance with the oil platform's windsock on final approach to 
landing.

Factual Information
 On February 1, 1999, at 1056 central standard time, a Bell 206L-3 helicopter, N6603X, was 
substantially damaged upon impact with a wind sock during final approach at the West Delta 
105B offshore platform in the Gulf of Mexico.  The commercial pilot, who was the sole 
occupant of the helicopter, was not injured.  The helicopter was registered to and operated by 
Petroleum Helicopters, Inc., of Lafayette, Louisiana.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and a company flight plan was filed for the Title 14 CFR Part 91 positioning flight 
which originated from the South Pass 25 offshore platform at 0915.
The pilot was positioning the helicopter to the West Delta 105B offshore platform when, 
according to the pilot's written statement, he heard a "buzzing sound followed by a right yaw."  
The pilot then executed a hovering autorotation to the platform.  The pilot stated that he 
suspected that the tail rotor blades contacted the wind sock during the approach.  The wind 
sock's internal frame showed evidence of a tail rotor blade strike.
Maintenance personnel reported that one of the tail rotor blades was missing approximately 
the outboard four inches.  The tail rotor gear box was torn from its mounting and the tail boom 
had sustained structural damage.
According to company flight records, the pilot had accumulated 3,893 hours total flight time, 
of which 2,517 hours were in the Bell 206L-3.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
