The pilot's failure to touch down on the dry area of the landing strip.  A factor was the soft 
terrain condition on the sides of the grass strip.

Factual Information
 On June 2, 1999, at 1315 central daylight time, a Grumman G-164A agricultural airplane, 
N73PB, owned and operated by Double L Flying Service, of Wallis, Texas, was substantially 
damaged during landing near Monaville, Texas.  The commercial pilot, sole occupant of the 
aircraft, was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a flight plan was not 
filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 local aerial application flight.
The pilot reported in the Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report, NTSB Form 6120.1/2, that 
while landing at a privately owned airstrip, the runway "appeared to be in good shape and dry."  
However, when the airplane's main landing gear touched down, "the wheels sunk into the soft 
ground," and the airplane nosed over onto its back.  The pilot reported that the landing area 
was "dry in the middle and soft on the sides."
Examination of the aircraft by the FAA inspector revealed that an upper wing spar, the engine 
mounts, and the vertical stabilizer were damaged.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
