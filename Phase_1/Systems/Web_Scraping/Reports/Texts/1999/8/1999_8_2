Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
HARLAN, IA
Accident Number:
CHI99LA274
Date & Time:
08/01/1999, 1500 CDT 
Registration:
N98FP
Aircraft:
North American AT-6G
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
On landing, the aircraft departed the left side of the runway 33 and struck a small ditch 
embankment.  The aircraft came to rest approximately 100 yards west of the runway.  A 
weather report showed winds from 30-degrees magnetic at 8 knots gusting to 14 knots.  The 
pilot stated that he was landing in a crosswind.  The pilot stated that the crosswind correction 
used on the approach was not '...well stabilized, and [a] go around was contemplated, but [the 
airplane] touched down and ground looped.'  A post accident examination of the airplane 
revealed no preexisting anomalies. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the failure of the pilot to maintain directional control of the aircraft during landing.  Factors to 
the accident were the crosswind, the failure of the pilot to maintain compensation for the 
crosswind condition on approach, and the inadvertent ground loop encountered by the pilot.

Factual Information
 On August 1, 1999, at 1500 central daylight time, a North American AT-6G, N98FP, piloted by 
a commercial pilot, sustained substantial damage during landing, on Runway 33 (4,100 feet by 
75 feet, dry/asphalt), at the Harlan Municipal Airport, Harlan, Iowa.  The flight was conducted 
under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91 and was not on a flight plan.  The pilot reported no 
injuries to himself or to his one passenger.  The flight had originated from the Wittman 
Regional Airport, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, about 1200.
In a written statement, the pilot stated that he was landing in a crosswind.  The pilot stated 
that the crosswind correction used on the approach was not "...well stabilized, and [a] go 
around was contemplated, but [the airplane] touched down and ground looped."
The aircraft departed the left side of the runway and struck a small ditch embankment.  The 
aircraft came to rest approximately 100 yards west of the runway.
A weather report for a reporting station located at the Aububon County Airport, Audubon, 
Iowa, which is 20 nautical miles and 70-degrees magnetic from the accident site, was reporting 
winds from 30-degrees magnetic at 8 knots gusting to 14 knots.
A post accident examination of the airplane revealed no preexisting anomalies.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
