Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane impacted terrain following an uncontrolled descent.  The horizontal stabilator and 
the left wing separated while the airplane was in a descending right turn on the downwind side 
of a mountain.  The pilot received a full preflight weather briefing and updated that with an 
abbreviated briefing prior to takeoff.  The briefings included a forecast for moderate to severe 
turbulence and icing along the route of flight.  While en route, the pilot experienced icing 
conditions and requested a lower altitude.  He received pilot reports while en route that 
indicated icing conditions were being encountered in the area of his destination.  The airplane 
was not equipped with anti-icing or deicing equipment.  A Safety Board weather study 
identified conditions that were conducive for clouds, turbulence, wind shear, icing, and 
mountain wave activity.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot disregarded his weather briefing and attempted flight into areas of forecast and 
reported icing and moderate to severe turbulence.  The airplane encountered mountain wave 
activity resulting in an overload condition and in-flight separation of the left wing and 
stabilator.  Mountainous terrain, icing conditions, and turbulence were factors in the accident.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On April 3, 1999, at 1931 Pacific standard time (PST), a Piper PA-32R-301, N9254Q, collided 
with terrain during an uncontrolled descent near Warner Springs, California.  Assist Business 
Services, Inc., owned the airplane and was operating it under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91.  
The personal flight departed Deer Valley Airport (DVT) Phoenix, Arizona, about 1700.  The 
private, instrument rated pilot and his three passengers sustained fatal injuries; the airplane 
was destroyed.  The flight was en route to McClellan/Palomar Field, Carlsbad, California, on an 
IFR flight plan.  Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at Ramona, California, the 
nearest reporting station; however, weather conditions at the airplane's cruise altitude and at 
the impact site are unknown.  The main wreckage's location was 33 degrees 09.443 minutes 
north latitude and 116 degrees 32.976 minutes west longitude.  Site elevation, derived from a 
handheld GPS (global positioning system), was 2,930 feet.
The Safety Board Investigator-in-Charge (IIC) listened to recorded radio transmissions 
between the pilot and the Prescott, Arizona, Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS).  The 
pilot filed a flight plan with the AFSS for an estimated departure time of 1700 PST.  He filed for 
a cruise altitude of 10,000 feet.  The route of flight was Deer Valley to the Buckeye VOR (very 
high frequency omni-directional radio range), Victor 16 to Blythe, Victor 460 to Julian, and 
vectors to Palomar.
The IIC listened to recorded radio transmissions between the pilot and the Los Angeles Air 
Route Traffic Control Center sector 9/10 (ZLA).  About 1820, the pilot reported icing 
conditions and requested a lower altitude.  ZLA cleared the pilot to descend to 9,000 feet and 
indicated 8,000 feet was available.  However, ZLA pointed out that the pilot would have to 
climb to a higher altitude as he progressed along his route due to minimum en route altitude 
requirements.  About 2 minutes later, the pilot requested to continue to 8,000 feet.
The IIC reviewed recorded radar data.  About 1820, the airplane's secondary beacon (code 
4106) indicated a descent began from a mode C reported altitude of 10,100 feet and continued 
to 8,200 feet.  About 1824, the pilot reported that he was below the clouds, which were at 
8,700 feet, and the ice was coming off.
About 1840, ZLA instructed the pilot to climb at his discretion to 9,000 feet.  The pilot later 
requested and received clearance to climb to 10,000 feet.  The secondary beacon indicated a 
climb began about 1840, and a mode C reported altitude of 10,200 feet was attained about 
1900.
ZLA later instructed the pilot to descend and maintain 9,000 feet, and then on down to 8,000 
feet.  At 1924:26, the secondary beacon indicated a southwesterly descent began from a mode C 
reported altitude of 10,000 feet.
ZLA instructed the pilot to contact SOCAL Approach on frequency 123.2.  The IIC reviewed a 
transcript of recorded radio transmissions between the pilot and Southern California TRACON 
San Diego North Radar (SDNR).  About 1926, SDNR informed the pilot he was 9 miles 
northeast of the Julian VOR.  SDNR instructed the pilot to cross Julian at or above 8,000 feet 
and cleared him for the ILS (instrument landing system) runway 24 Palomar via the Julian 
transition.  At 1926:26, the pilot acknowledged clearance for the approach.  No other 
transmissions were recorded from the pilot.  At 1926:25, the secondary beacon indicated a 
Page 4 of 11LAX99FA138
mode C reported altitude of 9,200 feet.
The flight path and descent progressed toward the Julian VOR.  The following mode C altitudes 
were recorded: at 1928:49, 9,000; at 1929:13, 8,900; at 1929:37, 8,800; and at 1930:01, 8,600.  
This computed to an average descent rate of 333 feet per minute (fpm) over this 72-second 
time frame.  At 1930:25,the mode C reported altitude was 8,200 feet, which was a location less 
than 2 miles from the VOR.  This computed to an average descent rate of over 1,700 fpm 
during this 24-second time frame.  The secondary beacon indicated the descent continued, but 
the track began a turn to the right.  The last secondary beacon target at 1930:37, indicated a 
mode C reported altitude of 7,900 feet.  During this 12-second span, the descent rate computed 
to 1,500 feet per minute.  The data indicated two more primary targets that continued turning 
to the right.  The last apparent target occurred at 1931:01, at coordinates 33 degrees 09 
minutes 45 seconds north latitude and 116 degrees 33 minutes 23 seconds west longitude.
About 1935, SDNR reported a loss of radio and radar contact with the airplane and issued an 
alert notice.  A civil air patrol unit working another mission in the area received an ELT 
(emergency locator transmitter) signal and discovered the wreckage about 0225 Pacific 
daylight time on April 4th.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
A review of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records revealed the pilot held a private 
pilot certificate with airplane single engine land and instrument ratings.  A review of the pilot's 
logbook revealed his first flight was on February 3, 1997, and he received the private certificate 
on May 28, 1997.  Total time at the private pilot check ride was 65.7 hours.  The first flight 
logged in the accident airplane was May 14, 1997.  He received the instrument rating on 
December 6, 1997.  The last flight recorded in the logbook was on March 16, 1999, and as of 
that entry, total flight time was about 565 hours.  He had about 520 hours in this make and 
model; about 35 hours were logged in the last 90 days.  He received a third-class medical 
certificate with no limitations or waivers on March 6, 1997.
AIRPLANE INFORMATION
The airplane was a New Piper Aircraft Corporation PA-32R-301, serial number 3246001.  A 
maintenance facility completed an annual inspection on June 12, 1998, at a total time of 505.3 
hours.  The engine was a Textron Lycoming IO-540-K1G5, serial number L-25593-48A.  Total 
time on the engine was 675.5 hours.  The tachometer read 675.5 at the accident scene.
METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS
The pilot obtained a weather briefing from the Prescott Automated Flight Service Station 
(AFSS) between 1536 and 1541 PST.  The different segments of the brief follow.
An AFSS specialist advised him of current in-flight weather advisories.  An AIRMET (Airman's 
Meteorological Information) existed for occasional moderate turbulence below flight level 180 
and mountain obscuration.  The specialist also advised that the Palomar, California, area would 
be just south of a SIGMET (Significant Meteorological Information) for severe turbulence 
below 14,000 feet with low-level wind shear potential.
The area forecast called for broken ceilings between 8,000 to 10,000 feet in the southern 
California desert areas.  In the San Diego area ceilings could be between 3,000 and 5,000 feet 
with visibility unrestricted.
Page 5 of 11LAX99FA138
The terminal forecast into the southern California area called for ceilings of 4,000 feet broken, 
15,000 feet broken, unrestricted visibility, surface winds from 160 degrees at 5 knots, with a 30 
per cent chance of ceilings 3,000 feet broken and rain shower activity.
The AFSS specialist briefed Pilot Reports (PIREPS), which included two reports of up and 
down drafts between 1,000 and 1,500 feet per minute over Thermal, California.  Another 
PIREP reported light rime ice over POGI VOR (195 degrees and 37 nautical miles from Julian).
The pilot asked for the freezing level over the mountains in southern California.  The AFSS 
specialist responded that it was about 6,000 feet, and asked if the pilot had deicing equipment 
installed.  The pilot replied he did not, and the AFSS specialist said that would be the pilot's 
main concern.  The pilot asked for confirmation of only the one icing report and if a front that 
was moving south was in the San Diego area.  The FSS specialist confirmed the lone icing 
report and said the front was not over San Diego, but the effects were.
Between 1633 and 1658 PST, the pilot contacted the Prescott AFSS to file an instrument flight 
rules (IFR) flight plan and obtain an abbreviated weather briefing.  The AFSS specialist advised 
of AIRMETS and asked the pilot if he wanted all of them read to him.  The pilot advised the 
specialist that he received all of them an hour earlier, and they were for turbulence.  He 
informed the specialist that he would like to know about any reports of freezing weather 
because he did not have deicing equipment.  He said he would expect it mainly over the Julian 
area.
The AFSS specialist noted a Citation jet 15 miles northwest of Julian reported light to moderate 
rime icing between 8,000 and 11,000 feet.  The specialist advised the pilot of two additional 
PIREPs in the area of Oceanside, California (262 degrees at 42 miles from Julian and 6 miles 
from his destination airport).  A Cessna 172 at 6,000 feet reported light rime icing, and an 
Embraer 120 reported moderate clear icing 20 miles northwest of Oceanside.  The pilot stated 
he would monitor that one and possibly stop short at Palm Springs, California.
A Safety Board staff meteorologist prepared a factual report.  The following paragraphs 
highlight pertinent facts, and the entire report is attached.  Sunset occurred at 1815 PST and 
civil twilight ended at 1840 PST.  There was 91 percent illumination of the moon.
The accident occurred in the vicinity of the Santa Rosa, Laguna, and Vulcan mountain ranges, 
which run in a northwest to southeast orientation.  These mountains often contribute to the 
formation of mountain wave activity and turbulence across southern California.  One of the 
highest peaks in these ranges, with an elevation in excess of 5,700 feet, is in the Vulcan 
Mountains.  This peak was within 2 miles of the accident site, and upwind of the flight track.  A 
steep slope to the northeast is also associated with the Vulcan Mountains.
The closest upper air station or rawinsonde was launched from Miramar, California, station 
number 72293 (239 degrees and 33 miles from the accident site).  The data from the 0000Z 
sounding indicated a freezing level of approximately 4,200 feet.  The data indicted wind at the 
surface was from 230 degrees at 12.8 knots; the wind increased in speed and slightly veered to 
a west-northwest direction with an increase in height.
The upper air data indicted saturated cloud layers between 3,000 to 6,000 feet and 9,000 to 
9,500 feet.  It also indicated that the associated cloud layers provided conditions favorable for 
the support of super cooled water droplets.  Temperatures between 7,000 to 10,000 feet varied 
from -3 to -7 degrees Celsius (C).  A strong vertical wind shear was present above the cloud 
layer.

The staff meteorologist used this data in a software program developed by Environmental 
Research Services to determine the potential for turbulence and icing.  It determined a 5 
percent probability of light clear ice at 9,796 feet; 80 percent chance of light rime at 9,650 feet; 
93 percent chance of severe rime at 9,107 feet; and 63 percent chance of moderate rime at 
9,053 feet.  It determined an 18 to 76 percent probability of moderate to severe clear icing 
potential at 6,000 feet and below.  It determined a 13 to 73 percent probability of light 
turbulence between 7,000 and 10,000 feet.
The staff meteorologist utilized infrared satellite data to determine that cloud tops were around 
15,000 feet.  He used this data to confirm the existence of an icing environment over the 
accident site.
Ramona (KRNM) elevation, 1,393 feet, was on a bearing of 244 degrees at 19 miles from the 
accident site.  The airport was equipped with an Automated Weather Observation System 
(AWOS-3), which the tower augmented locally.  A routine aviation weather report (METAR) 
for Ramona was issued at 1856 PST.  It stated skies were scattered at 600 feet above ground 
level (agl), broken at 1,100 feet, and overcast at 1,900 feet.  The remarks section noted the 
ceiling was variable between 800 and 1,200 feet.  Visibility was 9 miles in light rain showers; 
winds were from 260 degrees at 21 knots gusting to 29 knots.  The remarks section noted peak 
winds from 280 degrees at 30 knots occurred at 1839.  Temperature was 44 degrees 
Fahrenheit; dew point was 43 degrees Fahrenheit; and the altimeter setting was 29.74 InHg.
The automated observation for Ramona at 1924 PST reported: winds from 260 degrees at 20 
knots gusting to 23 knots; visibility 10 miles; a few clouds at 1,300 feet, ceiling overcast at 
1,900 feet; temperature 45 degrees Fahrenheit; dew point 41 degrees Fahrenheit; and altimeter 
29.73 inHg.  This observation included the remarks: peak wind from 250 degrees at 30 knots 
recorded at 1901 PST, rain ended at 1917, a trace of precipitation recorded (less than 0.01 
inches), thunderstorm sensor not operating.
Palomar (KCRQ), the destination airport at an elevation of 328 feet, was on a bearing of 258 
degrees at 37 miles from the accident site.  Palomar was equipped with an Automated Surface 
Observation System (ASOS), which was augmented by a human observer.  The METAR issued 
for Palomar at 1853 PST reported: winds from 280 degrees at 14 knots gusting to 23 knots; 
visibility 10 miles; a few clouds at 2,500 feet, a broken ceiling at 3,400 feet, overcast at 5,000 
feet; temperature 50 degrees Fahrenheit; dew point 41 degrees Fahrenheit; and altimeter 29.77 
inHg.  The remarks section noted a falling pressure tendency at 2.6 mb over 3 hours, and the 
rain ended at 1756 PST with a trace of rain the past hour and 0.04 inches for the preceding 3 
hours.
A METAR for Campos (CZZ), California, (172 degrees at 33 miles from the accident site, 
elevation 2,631 feet) was issued at 1852 PST.  It reported: winds from 230 degrees at 21 knots 
gusting to 30 knots; the visibility and sky conditions were missing; temperature 39 degrees 
Fahrenheit; dew point 37 degrees Fahrenheit; and altimeter 29.69 inHg.  The remarks section 
noted peak winds from 240 degrees at 33 knots occurred at 1827.
A METAR for Thermal (KTRM), California, (037 degrees at 34 miles from the accident site, 
elevation 114 feet below sea level) was issued at 1850 PST.  It reported: winds from 280 degrees 
at 13 knots; visibility 10 miles in light rain; broken ceiling at 7,000 feet, overcast at 9,000 feet; 
temperature 57 degrees Fahrenheit; dew point 36 degrees Fahrenheit; and altimeter 29.67 
inHg.  The remarks section noted that rain began at 1845.

COMMUNICATIONS
The pilot was on an IFR flight plan and in communication with Los Angeles Air Route Traffic 
Control Center (ZLA) while en route.  He established contact with SOCAL Approach on 
frequency 123.2, and had been cleared for the instrument approach procedure into Palomar.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The main wreckage site was on the 047 degree radial, approximately 2 miles from the Julian 
VOR.  An aerial search by a sheriff's helicopter located pieces of the airplane structure that 
were not collocated with the main wreckage.  The pieces were east of the last primary target.  
The left wing was the piece closest to the last primary target, and the right horizontal stabilator 
was the piece farthest away from the last primary target.  Investigators used a handheld GPS to 
derive the bearings and distances from the main wreckage.  The left wing was 0.4 nm (nautical 
miles) at 343 degrees.  The outboard section of the left horizontal stabilizer was 0.5 nm at 002 
degrees.  A portion of the left inboard horizontal stabilator was at 0.7 nm bearing 008 degrees.  
The left flap was 0.7 nm at 025 degrees.  The whole right horizontal stabilator was at 0.8 nm 
bearing 016 degrees.
The main wreckage consisted of the engine compartment, fuselage, rudder, and partially 
separated right wing.  The principal impact crater (PIC) contained one propeller blade and was 
approximately 8 feet long, 4 feet across, and 1-foot deep.  Paint shards were evident on a large 
rock bordering this dirt area.  The main wreckage was 29 feet from the PIC.  The cabin 
separated so that the control yokes and instrument panel stayed with the engine compartment, 
which was oriented along a magnetic bearing of 036 degrees.  The inverted fuselage and right 
wing tip were aligned 275 and 240 degrees, respectively.   The engine compartment was lying 
on its left side, and the left side had more damage than the right side.
The rudder mass balance and the top third of the rudder (above the top attach point) were not 
located.  Both rudder stops were in place and undamaged, although the left stop's paint was 
chipped.  Both cables were attached to the horn and traced to the cabin area.
The right horizontal stabilator's damage was different from the left.  However, both tip 
sections, outboard of the trim tab, had similar damage.
The right stabilator was in one piece with the inboard leading edge bent up, while the inboard 
trailing edge trim tab and hinge wire bent down.  Both upper stops fractured and separated 
while the lower stops were not damaged.  The right stabilator's inboard attach point sheared 
flush; the outboard attach point was bent over almost flush with the spar.  The box area was 
wrinkled from the front outboard area to the rear inboard area; the tip area was unwrinkled.
The left stabilator's inboard attaching point bent in and the bolthole was elongated.  The 
outboard attach point bent in and fractured through the bolthole on an angular plane.  The 
spar bent down and aft, and most of the bottom skin of the inboard section separated and was 
not found.  Its box area was crushed and wrinkled from the inboard leading edge to the 
outboard trailing edge.  Its rear spar bent down and the sheet metal unzipped along the trim 
tab hinge with the inboard hinge area peeling back.  Its outer section separated longitudinally 
at a rib with the leading edge rivets pulled through the skin of the outer section and the center 
section of rivets pulled through the skin of the inboard section (on top and bottom).  The 
bottom skin and rivets bent down and aft, and this skin tore from the center inboard edge 
along a 45-degree angle toward the outboard trailing edge.  Sheet metal on the skin of this 
outer section was unwrinkled.
Page 8 of 11LAX99FA138
Both wings exhibited symmetrical damage.  Both inboard leading edges buckled in and bent 
down.  Each wing tip was crushed back and neither wing exhibited chevrons.
The right wing remained attached at the leading edge and the spar sheared along a rivet line.  
Heads of a row of rivets along the outboard seam of the fuel tank pulled through the sheet 
metal.  The rear attach bolt was still in its fitting.  Retrievers cut both aileron cables; one had 
failed inside the wing in a bomb burst pattern.  The bottom spar cap broke at the outer 
boltholes, deformed up, and the fracture surface was angular and grainy.  Its webbing sheared 
along a rivet line, tore from the bottom up, and bent forward.  The top spar cap bent up, the 
webbing zipped apart, and the rivet heads on top of the wing skin pulled through.  The right 
aileron jammed at full up travel.  Its operating arm was bent, as was the aft arm of the 
bellcrank, and both cables were attached to the bellcrank.
The left wing separated from the airplane.  The rear attach bolt was still in the left wing.  The 
left wing bottom spar cap was broken at the outer boltholes and deformed up.  Its top spar cap 
bent up and fractured.  A few inches outboard of the fracture, the top spar cap bent down and 
then up.  The webbing was torn along a 45-degree angle and the fracture surface was irregular.  
Both the fore and aft aileron cables cut through the top skin of the wing to the second rib.  The 
leading edge of the wing had a curved imprint proceeding outboard from the start of the wing 
taper.  It was crushed in at the seam, and then dimpled in.  Two witness marks at or beyond 
full travel were on the inboard end of the left aileron.  The bottom mark sliced into the first rib 
and matches a paint chip on the structure.  Metal on the top surface bent down and the 
structure bent up, and chipped paint was on both surfaces.  The inboard operating arm 
impinged on the aileron's leading edge.  The aileron bent up several inches outboard of the 
outer hinge and operating arm.  The wing structure bent up in this area, and scratches on the 
bent up aileron matched up with the rivet pattern on the structure.  The aileron cables were 
attached to the bellcrank and the bellcrank's forward tang bent back.
The right flap's operating rod fractured at both ends; both ends of the rod and the rod itself 
were bent.  The manufacturer's representative determined the torque tube position indicated 
the flaps were up.
The left side of the fuselage had scrape marks and accordion crush damage in a curved imprint.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
The coroner for San Diego County completed an autopsy.  The FAA Toxicology and Accident 
Research Laboratory performed toxicological testing of specimens of the pilot.  The results of 
analysis of the specimens were negative for volatiles and tested drugs.  Tests were not 
performed for carbon monoxide and cyanide.
TESTS AND RESEARCH
The FAA, Textron Lycoming, and the New Piper Aircraft Company were parties to the 
investigation.  Investigators completed an examination of the wreckage under the supervision 
of the IIC on April 8, 1999.
Investigators slung the engine from a hoist for inspection.  The left side of the engine sustained 
more damage than the right side.  The investigators manually turned the propeller and 
obtained finger compression on all cylinders except cylinder No. 2, which sustained mechanical 
damage.  Valves in undamaged cylinders moved in sequence, and the accessory gears turned 
freely.
Page 9 of 11LAX99FA138
The left magneto separated from its mounting pad; the fracture surface was irregular and 
granular.  Pieces of its mounting flanges were secure under the mounting nuts.  The right 
magneto was loose on its mounting pad.  Both magnetos produced spark at all six posts when 
manually rotated.  Investigators observed oil in the bottom spark plug on cylinder No. 1 and 
both spark plugs for cylinder No. 4.  The fuel pump, with its lines attached, separated from its 
mounting flange.  Its plunger arm actuated with rotation of the engine.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
