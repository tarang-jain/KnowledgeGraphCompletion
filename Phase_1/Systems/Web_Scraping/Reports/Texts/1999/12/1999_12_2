Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported, 'The engine developed a bad noise and vibration so I turned it off and 
looked for a place to land.'  He landed in a farm field and the landing gear collapsed during 
rollout.  The inspection of the engine revealed the #1 connecting rod was detached from the 
crankshaft and the connecting rod cap was missing.  One rod cap bolt was intact although bent, 
and no nut was found on the bolt.  The other rod cap bolt was broken with the nut portion 
missing.  The #1 cylinder crankshaft journal was inspected.  No discoloring, significant scoring, 
or other damage was noted. The rod bolts and nuts for cylinders 2, 3, and 4 were inspected for 
proper installation and torque.  All nuts appeared to be properly installed.  The nuts were 
torque checked at 40 lbs.  No nuts moved at this torque setting.  The overhauled engine had 
been installed on the airplane on July 15, 1998.  The airplane had been flown approximately 50 
hours since the major overhaul. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the mechanic failed to torque the rod cap bolt during the major engine overhaul.  Factors 
relating to the accident included the rough field and the collapsed landing gear.

Factual Information
 On December 1, 1999, at 1105 central standard time, a Taylorcraft F-21, N2005J, was 
substantially damaged during an emergency landing in a farm field near Houlton, Wisconsin, 
after the airplane experienced a loss of engine power.  The 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight 
departed Lake Elmo (21D), Minnesota, at 1040, on a local flight. The private pilot was not 
injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed.
The pilot reported he was returning to land at Lake Elmo.  He reported, "The engine developed 
a bad noise and vibration so I turned it off and looked for a place to land.  I was in farm 
country.  Some smoke came into the cabin.  I picked a clear field and landed wings level at stall 
speeds.  The field was very rough.  The wheels folded up and I slid 60 feet.  Got out of the 
airplane after turning off the master."
An Airworthiness Inspector from the Federal Aviation Administration inspected the airplane.  
He reported the inspection of the engine revealed that the case was broken in the area of the 
number #1 cylinder.  He reported, "The #1 connecting rod was detached from the crankshaft 
and the connecting rod cap was missing.  One rod cap bolt was intact although bent, [and] no 
nut was found on the bolt.  The other rod cap bolt was broken with the nut portion missing.  
The #1 cylinder crankshaft journal was inspected.  No discoloring was noted.  No significant 
scoring or other damage was noted."  The inspector reported, "The rod bolts and nuts for 
cylinders 2, 3, and 4 were inspected for proper installation and torque.  All nuts appeared to be 
properly installed.  The nuts were torque checked at 40 lbs.  No nuts moved at this torque 
setting."
The overhauled engine had been installed on the airplane on July 15, 1998.  The airplane had 
been flown approximately 50 hours since the major overhaul.  The airplane received an annual 
inspection on July 7, 1999.  It had flown approximately 9 hours since the annual inspection.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
