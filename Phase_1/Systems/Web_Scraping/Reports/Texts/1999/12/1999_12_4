Factual Information
 On December 1, 1999, about 1330 eastern standard time, a Cessna 152, N46946, registered to 
Comair Aviation Academy, Inc., experienced a loss of directional control on landing and 
collided with a runway light at Orlando Sanford Airport, Sanford, Florida.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for the 14 CFR Part 
91 instructional flight.  The airplane was substantially damaged and the certified flight 
instructor (CFI) and student were not injured.  The flight originated about 1200 from the 
Orlando Sanford Airport, Sanford, Florida.
     The CFI stated that after takeoff, the flight proceeded northeast of the airport to practice 
maneuvers.  The flight then returned to the departure airport where the student pilot 
performed a touch-and-go landing on runway 9L.  Air traffic control then switched the airplane 
to runway 9C, and while on approach to the runway, the airplane, "...drifted into the grass on 
landing by crosswinds.  Student pilot was making touch and go, during the go around the 
aircraft touched down to the right of 9C and struck runway edge light."
     According to the 1353 local METAR weather observation at the Orlando Sanford Airport, in 
part the wind was from 020 degrees at 10 knots; there were no reported wind gusts.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
