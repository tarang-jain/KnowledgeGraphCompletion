Registration:
N4659T
Aircraft:
BARRETT BENSEN B-8
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was attempting a go-around from a private airstrip.  In a written statement, the pilot 
reported, 'I was coming in for a landing at my son-in-laws private airstrip.  The strip has his 
house and a power line on the west end and woods on the east end.  His strip is 1,200 feet long, 
plenty long for a gyro.  I had made several landings there before.  In the past my landings had 
been to the west.  Due to the wind this one was from the east.  As I approached I realized I was 
high and would use up a lot of runway, so I decided to go around.  I then eased the throttle on 
to full and made a right bank . (there was a street, house, power line and a river to the left).  At 
that moment the bird went into a downward roll to the left and nothing I did stopped it.  I was 
on the ground before I knew it'.  The pilot also stated that his airspeed was 40 mph and he did 
not recall making a right hand climb out before.  The pilot reported that there was no 
mechanical malfunction.  Examination of the wreckage revealed the gyroplane's rotor blades 
exhibited a cone shape. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the inadequate rotor rpm by the pilot.

Factual Information
 On May 1, 1999 at 1415 eastern daylight time, a Barrett Bensen B-8, N4659T, an experimental 
gyroplane, owned and piloted by a non-certificated pilot, received substantial damage on 
impact with terrain following a go-around attempt at a private airstrip.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight was not 
operating on a flight plan.  The pilot reported minor injuries.  The flight departed from 
Shepherd, Michigan, at 1400, en route to Mount Pleasant, Michigan.
During an interview the pilot stated that he approached a private airstrip in his gyroplane "a 
little high", He was going to use a lot of runway and elected to perform a go-around so as not to 
use a lot of runway.  He stated that he normally turns to the left, but there were houses in that 
direction, so he turned to the right.  He reported that he could not stop the slow roll to the right 
and impacted the terrain. 
In a written statement, the pilot reported, "I was coming in for a landing at my son-in-laws 
private airstrip.  The strip has his house and a power line on the west end and woods on the 
east end.  His strip is 1,200 feet long, plenty long for a gyro.  I had made several landings there 
before.  In the past my landings had been to the west.  Due to the wind this one was from the 
east.  As I approached I realized I was high and would use up a lot of runway, so I decided to go 
around.  I then eased the throttle on to full and made a right bank . (there was a street, house, 
power line and a river to the left).  At that moment the bird went into a downward roll to the 
left and nothing I did stopped it.  I was on the ground before I knew it".  The pilot also stated 
that his airspeed was 40 mph and he did not recall making a right hand climb out before.
The pilot reported that he held a student pilot certificate.  Federal Aviation Administration 
records indicate a third class medical certificate on July 14, 1995 was the last medical 
certificate that the pilot received.
The gyroplane had accumulated a total airframe time of 682 hours since April 5, 1990.  There 
was no record of an annual condition inspection.
The pilot reported that there was no mechanical malfunction.  Examination of the wreckage by 
the Federal Aviation Administration revealed the gyroplane's rotor blades to exhibit a cone 
shape.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
