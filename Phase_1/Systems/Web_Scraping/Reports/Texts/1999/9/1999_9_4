Analysis 
The student pilot was on his first solo flight.  His first takeoff, and traffic pattern went well.  
The student pilot said that his instructor told him to proceed with another takeoff and landing.  
On final approach, the student pilot said that he thought he was going to land short of the 
runway.  He attempted a go around, but 'applied too much left rudder, thereby heading to the 
grassy area between the runway and the taxiway.  The nose wheel hit the ground and [the 
airplane] skidded to a stop.' Examination of the airplane revealed no anomalies.

Factual Information
 On September 1, 1999, at 2000 eastern daylight time (edt), a Cessna 150L, N1316Q, operated 
by a solo student pilot sustained substantial damage when during landing the airplane struck 
the ground hard and came to a stop 100 feet left of runway 24 (3800' X 75', ASPH) at the Jack 
Barstow Airport, Midland, Michigan.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of 
the accident.  The instructional supervised solo flight was being conducted under 14 CFR Part 
91.  No flight plan was on file.  The student pilot reported no injuries.  The local flight 
originated at Midland, Michigan, at 1950 edt.
In his written statement, the student pilot said that he was on his first solo flight.  His first 
takeoff, traffic and pattern went well.  The student pilot said that his instructor told him to 
proceed with another takeoff and landing.  On final approach, the student pilot said that he 
thought he was going to land short of the runway.  He attempted a go-around, but "applied too 
much left rudder, thereby heading to the grassy area between the runway and the taxiway.  The 
nose wheel hit the ground and [the airplane] skidded to a stop."    
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector examined the airplane at the Jack Barstow 
Airport.  The firewall, nose wheel and engine mount were bent upward.  The rear window was 
broken out.  The left wingtip was broken aft.  The left wing rear spar was bent downward.  
Flight control continuity was confirmed.  No anomalies were revealed with the engine, engine 
controls, or other airplane systems.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
