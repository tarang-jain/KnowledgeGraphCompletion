Location:
CAIRO, GA
Accident Number:
ATL99LA121
Date & Time:
09/01/1999, 0845 EDT 
Registration:
N8965Q
Aircraft:
Aero Commander S2R
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
Shortly after liftoff from the runway, the engine backfired and lost power. An  eyewitness at the 
airport reported seeing black smoke coming from the airplane during  the attempted takeoff. 
The pilot turned right and selected a field for the emergency landing. After clearing a nearby 
pond, the pilot dumped the load of chemicals, and landed in a field about 300 yards beyond the 
pond. The examination of the airplane failed to disclose a mechanical problem. During the 
examination of the engine, fuel was recovered from the fuel system. Examination of the 
carburetor also failed to disclose a mechanical malfunction or component failure.  A review of 
the weather data disclosed that the temperature was 68 degrees, and the dew point was 66 
degrees.  According to the Icing Probability Curves, conditions were favorable for the formation 
of carburetor ice. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons. Factors were weather conditions favorable 
for the formation of carburetor ice.

Factual Information
 On September 1, 1999, at 0845 eastern daylight time, an Aero Commander S2R, N8965Q, 
collided with the ground during an attempted forced landing in a field near Cairo-Grady 
Municipal Airport in Cairo, Georgia. The aerial application flight was operated under the 
provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 137 with no flight plan filed. Visual weather conditions 
prevailed at the time of the accident. The airplane sustained substantial damage, and the 
commercial pilot was not injured. The flight departed Cairo, Georgia, at 0844.    
According to the pilot, shortly after liftoff from runway 12 at the Cairo-Grady Municipal 
Airport, the engine backfired and lost power. An eyewitness at the airport reported seeing black 
smoke coming from the airplane during the attempted takeoff. The pilot turned right and 
selected a field for the emergency landing. After clearing a nearby pond, the pilot dumped the 
load of chemicals, and landed in a field about 3000 yards beyond the pond.  The pilot reported 
that during the emergency landing, the landing gear collapsed and the right forward wing spar 
sustained damage.  
The examination of the airplane failed to disclose a mechanical problem. During the 
examination of the engine, fuel was recovered from the fuel system. Examination of the 
carburetor also failed to disclose a mechanical malfunction or component failure.  A review of 
the weather data disclosed that the temperature was 68 degrees, and the dew point was 66 
degrees.  According to the Icing Probability Curves, conditions were favorable for the formation 
of carburetor ice (see attached icing probability curves).

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
