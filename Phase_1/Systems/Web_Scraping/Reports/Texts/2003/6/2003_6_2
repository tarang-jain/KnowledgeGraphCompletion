Factual Information
On June 1, 2003, about 2000 eastern daylight time, a Stinson 108-1, N8278K, piloted by a 
private pilot, sustained substantial damage when the right main landing gear collapsed during 
landing rollout on runway 32 (3,920 feet by 49 feet, asphalt) at the Riverview Airport, Jenison, 
Michigan.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The personal 
flight was operating under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91 without a flight plan.  The pilot and 
two passengers reported no injuries.  The flight departed from a private airstrip near 
Hudsonville, Michigan.
The pilot stated that upon touchdown the airplane instantly veered to the left.  The pilot 
reported that he applied full right rudder and the brakes, but could not regain control of the 
airplane.  The pilot stated that the right wing came in contact with the ground, and the right 
landing gear collapsed.  The airplane then "slid" off the left side of the runway, and the 
propeller struck the ground twice before the airplane came to a full stop.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
