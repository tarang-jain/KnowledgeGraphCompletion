Location:
AVONDALE, AZ
Accident Number:
LAX03LA122
Date & Time:
04/01/2003, 1300 MST 
Registration:
N30913
Aircraft:
Ayres S2R-T34
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The airplane struck power lines during the final agricultural spray application of the day.  This 
particular pass involved flying underneath power lines.  There was a backhoe parked near the 
pilot's intended flight path; as a result, he flew a higher than normal flight path.  The airplane 
impacted the lower power lines.  The pilot then flew the airplane back to his original departure 
point.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot failed to maintain adequate visual lookout and did not maintain clearance from 
power lines.  The backhoe's location, which caused the pilot to alter his planned flight path, was 
a factor.

Factual Information
On April 1, 2003, about 1300 mountain standard time, an Ayres S2R-T34, N30913, struck 
power line wires during a low altitude aerial application pass near Avondale, Arizona.  Pierce 
Aviation was operating the airplane under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 137.  The commercial 
pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured; the airplane sustained substantial damage.  The local 
aerial application flight departed a private strip near Buckeye, Arizona, about 1230.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.  The accident occurred 
at 33 degrees 20 minutes north latitude and 112 degrees 20 minutes west longitude.
In a written statement submitted by the pilot, he reported that the purpose of the flight was to 
spray the last of seven fields.  This particular pass involved flying underneath power lines.  
There was a backhoe parked near the pilot's intended flight path; as a result, he flew a higher 
than normal flight path.  The airplane impacted the lower power lines, resulting in damage to 
the propeller, top canopy, vertical stabilizer, horizontal stabilizer, elevator, and rudder.  The 
pilot then flew the airplane back to his original departure point.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
