Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
While departing from runway 01, the airplane lifted off, about 1,000 feet down the 1,800-foot 
long wet turf runway.  The pilot felt a "strong breeze, almost a tailwind," and the airplane 
began to settle downward, touching back down on the runway surface.  The airplane then 
bounced back into the air, and would not climb out of ground effect.  The pilot decided not to 
abort the takeoff, fearing that the nosewheel would sink into the muddy runway, and flip the 
airplane over. As the airplane continued past the departure end of the runway, the airplane still 
would not climb, and pilot performed a forced landing to a marsh area.  After the accident, the 
pilot stated that he "should have aborted the takeoff when he first had the chance to."  The pilot 
additionally stated that the maximum allowable gross weight of the airplane was 2,350 pounds, 
and the takeoff weight at the time of the accident was 2,240 pounds.  Review of the Airplane 
Flight Manual revealed that the total takeoff ground roll, from a level, dry, hard surfaced 
runway, was about 1,248 feet.  No charts were available to compute a ground roll distance from 
a wet turf runway.  The winds reported by an airport located about 7 miles west of the accident 
site, at 1151, were from 150 degrees at 5 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's delay in aborting the takeoff after his failure to obtain a proper climb rate.  Factors 
related to the accident were the tailwind conditions, and the wet turf runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
