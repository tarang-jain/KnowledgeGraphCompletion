Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot was on final approach, with landing flaps, at a low altitude, transitioning to land 
when deer ran in front of the airplane.  The pilot reported that he thought the airplane would 
strike the deer, and abruptly pulled back on the control wheel.  He also added power; however, 
the pitch up preceded the engine responding.  The pilot said the stall horn sounded 
momentarily, and then the airplane descended in a nose down attitude and struck the ground, 
about 150 feet short of the runway and slid for 100 feet.  The nose landing gear collapsed, the 
lower fuselage was crushed, and the firewall was wrinkled.  A witness reported that the final 
approach course brought the airplane over a corn field, where deer have been seen before.  The 
landing distance chart from the Owner's manual revealed the airplane could have crossed the 
end of the runway at 50 feet, and still stopped within the remaining runway.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's abrupt evasive maneuver to avoid the deer, which resulted in the loss of airspeed 
and an inadvertent stall.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
