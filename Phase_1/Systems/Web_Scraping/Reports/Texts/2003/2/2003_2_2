Analysis 
The private pilot was demonstrating a run on landing to the check pilot. The helicopter touched 
down in the sod area adjacent to runway 08 in a level attitude at or above effective 
translational lift.  During the deceleration the left front skid contacted an unknown object 
which slowed the helicopter rapidly. The private pilot lunged forward in his seat and 
inadvertently moved the cyclic forward and to the left and increased collective pitch. The 
helicopter pivoted around the toe of the left skid and rolled over on its left side before he or the 
check pilot could take any corrective action. The private pilot stated the helicopter did not 
experience any mechanical failure or malfunction.

Factual Information
On February 1, 2003, at 0945 eastern standard time, a Robinson R22 helicopter, N528EE, 
registered to a private owner, leased to Heliflight Inc., operating as a 14 CFR Part 91 
instructional flight, collided with an unknown object on the ground during a run on landing at 
Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The helicopter rolled over on its left side and sustained 
substantial structural damage to the cabin and tailboom assembly. The private pilot and airline 
transport rated check pilot reported no injuries. The flight originated from Fort Lauderdale 
Executive Airport, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, at 0830.
The private pilot stated he was demonstrating a run on landing to the check pilot. The 
helicopter touched down in the sod area adjacent to runway 08 in a level attitude at or above 
effective translational lift.  During the deceleration the left front skid contacted "something" 
which slowed the helicopter rapidly. The pilot stated he lunged forward in his seat and 
inadvertently moved the cyclic forward and to the left and increased collective pitch. The 
helicopter pivoted around the toe of the left skid and rolled over on its left side before he or the 
check pilot could take any corrective action. He further stated the helicopter did not experience 
any mechanical failure or malfunction.
Examination of the crash site did not identify the unknown object that the helicopter collided 
with.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
