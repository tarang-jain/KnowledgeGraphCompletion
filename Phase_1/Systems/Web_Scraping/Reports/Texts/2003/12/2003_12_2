Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Birmingham, AL
Accident Number:
ATL04LA044
Date & Time:
12/02/2003, 1950 CST 
Registration:
N3056Q
Aircraft:
Cessna 182-K
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
3 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Business
Analysis 
The flight was uneventful until the approach to land at the destination airport. When the pilot 
reduced engine power for the approach, the engine lost power and the throttle would not 
respond.  The pilot informed the control tower that he had a loss of power and proceeded to set 
up for an emergency landing.  The airplane clipped a tree top and went through a power line 
before touching down on the ground.  The airplane landed hard, the nose gear collapsed, and 
the left wing collided with a light pole.  Examination of the airplane found the left and right 
wings had spar and wing skin damage. Examination of the engine found the throttle cable 
separated from the throttle body arm.  The throttle cable attaching bolt was still attached to the 
throttle body arm, the nut was missing and the bolt was not drilled for a cotter key. Further 
review disclosed that Airworthiness Directive 86-24-07 and Cessna Information Letter SE79-6 
had not been complied with when the engine assembly was recently installed during the annual 
inspection.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power due to the throttle/power lever cable becoming disconnected in-flight, 
as a result of maintenance personnel failure to comply with Airworthiness Directive (AD) 86-
24-07 and Cessna information letter SE79-6.

Factual Information
On December 2, 2003, at 1950 central standard time, a Cessna 182-K, N3056Q, registered to 
Cowarts Construction Company, and operated by the private pilot, collided with a power line 
and subsequently the ground while on approach to Birmingham International Airport, 
Birmingham, Alabama. The flight was operated under the provisions of Title 14, CFR Part 91, 
and instrument flight rules. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument 
flight plan was filed. The pilot and two passengers received minor injuries and the airplane 
sustained substantial damage. The flight originated from Salem Airport, Salem, Arkansas, on 
December 2, 2003, at 1700.
The pilot stated that the flight was uneventful until the approach to land in Birmingham.  The 
pilot pulled the manifold pressure to 12.5 inches to descend and added power to align with the 
glide slope, but the engine did not respond.  He then added full power, but still nothing 
happened.  The pilot informed the control tower that he had a loss of power and proceeded to 
set up for an emergency landing.  He stated the airplane clipped a tree top and went through a 
power line before touching down on the ground.  The pilot stated the airplane "landed hard," 
the nose gear collapsed, and the left wing collided with a light pole.
Examination of the airplane found the left and right wings had spar and wing skin damage, the 
right stabilizer and the bottom of the airframe sustained crush damage. The nose gear was 
folded aft. Examination of the engine found the throttle cable separated from the throttle body 
arm.  The throttle cable attaching bolt was still attached to the throttle body arm, the nut was 
missing and the bolt was not drilled for a cotter key. Additionally, the examination of the 
throttle cable assembly revealed that Airworthiness Directive 86-24-07 and Cessna 
Information Letter SE79-6 had not been complied with when the engine assembly was recently 
installed during the annual inspection.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
