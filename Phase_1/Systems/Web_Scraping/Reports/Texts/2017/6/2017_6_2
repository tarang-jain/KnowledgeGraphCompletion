Aviation Incident Final Report
Location:
Fulton, NY
Incident Number:
CEN17IA233
Date & Time:
06/01/2017, 1830 EDT 
Registration:
N366TF
Aircraft:
SCHRODER DAVID LANCAIR IV P
Aircraft Damage:
None
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot and a flight instructor planned to conduct an inflight calibration of an angle of attack 
indicator. Following a zero g-force maneuver, engine oil pressure decreased to 3 psi and engine 
speed increased to 3,140 rpm. Immediately after the engine overspeed, a total loss of power 
occurred. The pilot performed a forced landing to the departure airport without further 
incident. 
Examination of the engine revealed one of the two rear crankshaft counterweights (6th order) 
separated from the crankshaft, with a 6th order counterweight connecting pin lodged in the 
crankcase between cylinder Nos. 4 and 6. An impression in the No. 1 connecting rod matched 
the shape of a 6th order counterweight connecting pin. The oil sump contained significant 
debris, including four counterweight pin retaining snap rings, four counterweight pin retainer 
plates, and two 6th order counterweight connecting pins. Based on the examination, the lack of 
oil pressure and subsequent engine rpm overspeed/surge likely caused the separation of the 
crankshaft counterweight and engine failure. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
The loss of oil pressure and subsequent engine overspeed/surge during a zero g-force 
maneuver, which resulted in the separation of a crankshaft counterweight and loss of engine 
power.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On June 1, 2017, at 1830 eastern daylight time, a Lancair IV-P airplane, N366TF, lost engine 
power and conducted a forced landing at the Oswego County Airport (FZY), Fulton, New York. 
The pilot and flight instructor were not injured and the airplane sustained minor damage. The 
airplane was registered to and operated by MS Rochelle LLC under the provisions of 14 
Code of 
Federal Regulations Part
 91 as a personal flight. Day visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed for the local flight, which departed from FZY at 1819 
The purpose of the flight was to calibrate an Advanced Flight Systems Advanced Pro 3 angle of 
attack system, which included a series of zero g-force maneuvers. According to the flight 
instructor, during the first maneuver, he and the pilot noticed an engine overspeed, as well as a 
noticeable "bang" and a total loss of engine power. The pilot performed a forced landing at FZY 
without further incident. During the descent and landing, the propeller continued to windmill. 
According to data downloaded from the onboard Electronics International MVP-50 engine 
monitor, engine start occurred at 1806. A normal engine runup occurred at 1816, including 
magneto and propeller governor checks. Takeoff with full engine power occurred at 1819 and 
the airplane climbed normally to 12,000 ft msl. 
At 1829:29, the zero g-force maneuver occurred. Oil pressure indications, which had been 
normal until this time, decreased to 3 psi by 1829:32, followed by an engine overspeed of 3,140 
rpm at 1829:34. From 1829:34 to 1830:10, engine rpm indications varied from zero to 2,700 
rpm, and oil pressure indications varied from zero to 50 psi. At 18:29:38, the alternator charge 
indication dropped to zero. 
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
The composite airplane was constructed from a kit with components manufactured by Lancair 
International, Inc. The airplane was equipped with a Continental Motors TSIO-550E engine 
(s/n 803138), an MT Propeller USA MTV-14-D constant-speed four-blade wood propeller 
(non-counterweighted), and a McCauley C290D3-K/T43 propeller governor. According to the 
engine's type certificate data sheet, maximum engine rpm was 2,700 rpm. The oil sump 
capacity was 12 quarts, with 6.5 quarts usable at a 14.5 degrees nose down attitude. 
According to engine logbooks, a teardown inspection occurred on December 18, 2008, due to a 
propeller strike. On October 15, 2012, Barrett Precision Engines Inc. overhauled the engine, 
which included documented compliance with Continental Motors Service Bulletin 00-3, 
Counterweight Installation. On February 1, 2017, an entry was recorded to correct a rough 
running engine and a rising No. 3 cylinder exhaust gas temperature; which maintenance 
attributed to incorrect timing. On April 7, 2017, the No. 3 cylinder was replaced, due to a 
fractured bolt on the intake rocker shaft. 
ENGINE EXAMINATION
Page 4 of 7CEN17IA233
Examination of the engine revealed the crankcase was breached in several places and the 
camshaft drive gear was displaced away from the crankshaft drive gear. Extensive internal 
damage was noted to the interior of the crankcase and cylinder skirts, due to connecting rod 
contact. Both magnetos were dislodged from their respective mounts. One of the two rear 
crankshaft counterweights (6th order) was separated from the crankshaft, and the Nos. 1 and 4 
connecting rods were fractured.
The oil tube from the sump to the oil pump was compromised and thermal discoloration and 
oil starvation distress were noted on the Nos 2, 3, 4, and 6 connecting rods and bearings. The 
oil sump contained significant metal fragments, including four counterweight pin retaining 
snap rings, four counterweight pin retainer plates and two 6th order counterweight connecting 
pins. After separating the engine case, a 6th order counterweight connecting pin was found 
lodged in the crankcase between cylinders Nos. 4 and 6 and an impression in the No. 1 
connecting rod matched the shape of a 6th order counterweight connecting pin.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
On November 15, 2015, a Lancair IV-P accident occurred that involved the same model engine, 
propeller, and propeller governor as this incident. The sequence of events for the accident 
(NTSB# CEN16LA043) involved a practice emergency descent with a 0.5 g-force load factor, 
which led to an engine oil pressure drop, engine overspeed, and total loss of power. The 
investigation concluded that a duel magneto failure occurred due to an engine overspeed/surge 
inducing shock loads on the gear train. During this investigation, several Lancair pilots who 
had competed in the Reno Air Races stated that low G maneuvering would often result in a 
transient drop in engine oil pressure and an engine surge and/or overspeed. 
According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) small airplane standards staff, an 
angle of attack system calibration procedure which requires zero g-force flight is not approved 
for installation on certified aircraft.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
