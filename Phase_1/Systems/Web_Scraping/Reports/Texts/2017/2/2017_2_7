Registration:
N7518G
Aircraft:
ROBINSON HELICOPTER R22
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The student pilot, who held a commercial fixed-wing pilot certificate, was performing hovering 
flight during his first helicopter lesson when the helicopter "suddenly jerked backwards." The 
helicopter's tail rotor gearbox and a portion of the tail rotor departed the helicopter, and the 
flight instructor landed the helicopter upright with no injuries to the two occupants.
According to the flight instructor, he monitored the cyclic, collective, and tail rotor controls 
while explaining hovering flight and surrendered each control to the student pilot one at a time 
until the student pilot was fully controlling the helicopter. As the helicopter transitioned 
backward and began a "spin to the left," he requested and took control of the helicopter, but 
the student pilot did not surrender the controls, and the flight instructor could not overpower 
the student pilot's inputs before the tail rotor collided with terrain. The flight instructor further 
stated that there were no mechanical deficiencies with the helicopter that would have 
precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to relinquish the flight controls to the flight instructor, which 
resulted in a collision with terrain.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=94685
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
