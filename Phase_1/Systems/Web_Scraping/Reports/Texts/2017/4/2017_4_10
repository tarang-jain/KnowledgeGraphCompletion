Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The student pilot in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that he accomplished several 
takeoffs and landings on the asphalt runway during his solo flight in the pattern. He reported 
that, during his sixth landing, the airplane swerved to the left and subsequently swerved to the 
right during the landing roll. He attempted to control the airplane's direction with rudder pedal 
application, but he inadvertently applied the toe brakes, and the airplane nosed over. The 
airplane sustained substantial damage to both left side wing struts, the rudder, and the 
windscreen. 
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with 
the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's loss of directional control during the landing roll and his subsequent 
inadvertent brake application, which resulted in a nose-over. 
Findings

Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
