ERA17LA305
Date & Time:
09/01/2017, 1058 EDT 
Registration:
N5189K
Aircraft:
MD HELICOPTER 369
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of tail rotor effectiveness
Injuries:
2 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Public Aircraft
Analysis 
During the approach to line up with a helipad, the commercial pilot noted that the helipad was 
not set up for landing into the wind, so he discontinued the approach and decided to land on a 
nearby wash rack, into the wind. As he turned right, the helicopter encountered a wind gust, or 
the wind was blocked by a nearby outbuilding, which can cause a turbulent effect. The 
helicopter suddenly and violently yawed right and pitched up. He attempted to correct the 
condition with pedal and cyclic inputs; however, a right spin ensued, and the helicopter spun to 
the ground and then came to rest on its right side. 
The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or anomalies with 
the helicopter that would have precluded normal operation. It is likely that the pilot did not 
adequately compensate for wind conditions, and when he added power to compensate, the 
helicopter yawed right and pitched up. The pilot was unable to stop the yaw and lost helicopter 
control due to a loss of tail rotor effectiveness.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions during the approach to landing, 
which resulted in a loss of helicopter control due to a loss of tail rotor effectiveness.

Factual Information
On September 1, 2017, at 1058 eastern daylight time, a MD Helicopters 369FF, N5189K, was 
substantially damaged while maneuvering to land at Gwinnett County Airport (LZU), 
Lawrenceville, Georgia. The commercial pilot and a pilot-rated crewmember were seriously 
injured. The helicopter was operated by the Gwinnett County Police Department as a local, 
public-use flight. Day, visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time, and no flight plan 
was filed. The flight originated at LZU about 1000.
The pilot reported the following that the preflight inspection of the helicopter and en route 
portions of the flight were uneventful. After about 1 hour on station performing law 
enforcement duties, the pilot returned to LZU to get ahead of deteriorating weather conditions. 
The flight was cleared to land on taxiway whiskey, then perform a side-step maneuver to the 
police helipad. The pilot recalled winds from 220° at 10 knots. He performed a normal 
approach to a 10-foot hover to taxiway whiskey. As he made a left turn to line up with the 
helipad, he noted that the cart on the helipad was not set up for a landing into the wind. He 
elected to discontinue the approach and make a right turn to land on a wash rack, into the 
wind.
As the pilot was about to initiate the turn to the wash rack, the pilot noted a "strong wind gust" 
followed by a "sudden, uncommanded, violent, right yaw" and "what seemed to be an 
uncommanded climb." He applied cyclic and pedal inputs; however, the helicopter continued 
in a right spin for at least two full rotations until it impacted the ground. The pilot and 
crewmember were met by first responders and transported to a local hospital for treatment of 
their injuries.
The pilot later reported that a small, county-owned outbuilding near the police pad can mask 
or block the wind, creating a turbulent effect. He stated that the perceived wind gust could also 
have been the tail rotor becoming "unmasked" from behind the outbuilding. The pilot further 
reported there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have 
precluded normal operation of the helicopter.
An inspector with the Federal Aviation Administration responded to the accident site and 
examined the wreckage. He reported that the helicopter came to rest on its right side in the 
grass, adjacent to a taxiway. There was no fire. Structural damage to the fuselage, tail rotor, 
and main rotor were confirmed. The main rotor blades were severed during the impact and 
were scattered up to 220 feet from the main wreckage. His examination of the wreckage did 
not reveal evidence of a mechanical malfunction or anomaly.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=95936
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
