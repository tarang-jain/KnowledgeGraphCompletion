Aviation Accident Preliminary Report
Location:
Erwinna, PA
Accident Number:
ERA18LA019
Date & Time:
11/03/2017, 1400 EDT 
Registration:
N21EM
Aircraft:
MAURER ELMO A V STAR SA900
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On November 3, 2017, about 1400 eastern daylight time, an experimental amateur-built V-Star 
SA9000, N21EM, collided with terrain during landing at Vansant Airport (9N1), Erwinna, 
Pennsylvania. The private pilot was seriously injured. Day, visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed at the time, and no flight plan was filed for the local, personal flight. The flight was 
operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91.
A witness stated he saw the accident airplane depart, and about thirty minutes later he saw the 
airplane approach the airport from the east. He initially saw the airplane in a normal flight 
attitude over the runway before it disappeared briefly behind rolling terrain. Then he saw the 
left wing, then the right wing, followed by the tail, he described it as a "cartwheeling" motion. 
He did not report hearing any strange sounds being emitted by the airplane on the takeoff or 
landing, nor did he see any smoke or objects falling from the airplane.
Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed the 
fuselage came to rest on its nose, and the tail was resting against tree branches. The engine was 
separated from the airframe, but the airplane remained largely intact.
The single-seat, bi-wing airplane was manufactured in 1980 and was equipped with a 
Lycoming O-290, 140-horsepower reciprocating engine.
The pilot held a private pilot certificate with a glider rating, and a sport pilot endorsement for 
airplane single engine land. He reported 20 hours of total flight experience on his most recent 
application for an FAA third-class medical certificate, which was issued on November 23, 1983.
The weather conditions reported at the Doyelstown Airport (DYL), Doylestown, Pennsylvania, 
about 9 miles south of the accident site, included wind from 230° at 7 knots, visibility 10 
statute miles, clear skies, temperature 21° C, dew point 14° C, and an altimeter setting of 30.04 
inches of mercury.
