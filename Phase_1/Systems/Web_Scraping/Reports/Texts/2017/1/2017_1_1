Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
New Braunfels, TX
Accident Number:
CEN17LA079
Date & Time:
01/01/2017, 1130 CST 
Registration:
N415HC
Aircraft:
QUICKSILVER GT-400 R503
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The sport pilot reported that, about 15 minutes into the pleasure flight, the engine began 
"sputtering" and losing power. The pilot attempted to correct the problem by adjusting the 
throttle and applying the engine primer without success. The pilot then selected a field for a 
forced landing, during which the right main landing gear struck a power line. The airplane then 
flipped over and subsequently impacted a carport rooftop. 
Examination of the engine revealed that one of the four spark plugs was loose in the cylinder, 
which led to a loss of compression and partial loss of engine power. The pilot's safety 
recommendation stated, "closer inspection of checking spark plugs before flight."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The partial loss of engine power due to a loose spark plug. Contributing to the accident was the 
pilot's improper preflight inspection of the airplane.

Factual Information
On January 1, 2017, about 1130 central standard time, a Quicksilver GT-400 R503 
experimental light sport airplane, N415HC, impacted power lines during a forced landing 
following a partial loss of engine power near New Braunfels, Texas. The sport pilot, who was 
the sole occupant, was not injured, and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The 
airplane was registered to and operated by a private individual as a 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of 
the accident and a flight plan was not filed. The local flight departed a private airstrip about 
1110.
According to the pilot/owner, about 15 minutes into the pleasure flight, the engine began 
"sputtering" and losing power. The pilot attempted to correct the problem by adjusting the 
throttle and applying engine primer. The attempts were unsuccessful in restoring engine 
power. The pilot then identified a field for a forced landing. During the forced landing, the right 
main landing gear struck a power line. After impacting the power line, the airplane flipped 
inverted, and dropped about 20 feet onto a carport rooftop. The pilot exited the airplane.
Examination of the airplane by Federal Aviation Administration inspectors revealed both 
wings were bent and the wing fabric was damaged. No visual anomalies with the engine were 
noted.
After the airplane was recovered from the carport, the pilot and a few friends examined the 
airplane and systems. The pilot noticed that one of the four engine spark plugs was loose in the 
cylinder. The pilot determined that the loose spark plug led to a loss of compression and partial 
loss of engine power during the accident flight. The pilot's safety recommendation, as noted in 
the pilot/operator accident report, stated "closer inspection of checking spark plugs before 
flight."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
