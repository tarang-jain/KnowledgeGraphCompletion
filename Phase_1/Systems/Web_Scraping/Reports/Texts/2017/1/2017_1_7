Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On January 4, 2017, about 1430 Pacific standard time, an experimental amateur-built 
Schosanski, Cozy MK IV R airplane, N4518S, experienced a total loss of engine power after an 
attempted go-around during a touch-and-go landing at Napa County Airport (APC), Napa, 
California. The pilot subsequently made a forced landing on the remaining runway and the 
airplane overran the runway. The airplane was registered and operated by the owner/pilot 
under the provisions of 14 
Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) Part 91. The commercial pilot 
was not injured. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing. The local personal 
flight departed Napa, California, about 1400 PST. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed 
and no flight plan was filed.
The pilot reported that he was in the traffic pattern performing touch-and-go landings on 
runway 24. During approach, the pilot noted that the airplane would have landed further down 
the runway than desired and he initiated a go-around. As he advanced the throttle, the engine 
responded normally, but then rolled back to idle. The pilot attempted to land on the remaining 
runway, but the airplane overran the end of the runway and came to rest in a marsh area.
The airplane was powered by an automotive Mazda rotary engine, which was modified by the 
owner. The airplane was recovered for further examination.
