Location:
Plato Center, IL
Accident Number:
GAA18CA069
Date & Time:
12/02/2017, 1650 CST 
Registration:
N912GR
Aircraft:
WEAVER DAVID A PULSAR   912XP
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Controlled flight into terr/obj 
(CFIT)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that, while making a straight-in approach to a private airport just after dusk, 
but before dark, he attempted to activate the pilot-controlled lighting (PCL) but was 
unsuccessful. He added that he continued toward the airport, and while maneuvering for 
landing, he lost sight of the airport. The pilot did not regain visual reference of the airport 
during the landing descent, and the airplane impacted a fence adjacent to the runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport owner reported that the PCL antenna required line-of-sight with the aircraft to 
operate the PCL system. Due to the antenna's position and hangars on the airport, the antenna 
did not receive signals from the southeast, the direction from which the accident airplane was 
approaching. He added that, because the airport was private, he could not issue a NOTAM to 
describe the operation of the runway lights.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to continue to land without visual reference to the airport in low light 
conditions. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's inability to activate the private airport's 
pilot-controlled lighting system due to its configuration.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
