Analysis   
On December 3, 2017, about 1825 eastern standard time, American Airlines flight 1531, an 
Airbus 319, N9011P, collided with American Airlines flight 1613, a Boeing 737-800, N344PP, 
on a taxiway at Miami International Airport (KMIA), Miami, Florida. There were no injuries to 
the occupants of either airplane and N344PP was substantially damaged. Both flights were 
scheduled passenger flights operating under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 121. N9011P 
originated from Toncontín International Airport (MHTG), Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and had 
126 passengers and crew onboard. N344PP originated from Luis Muñoz Marín International 
Airport (TJSJ), San Juan, Puerto Rico, and had 168 passengers and crew onboard. 
According to flight crew statements, N344PP had landed on runway 09 and was instructed to 
turn onto taxiway N5 from taxiway M. The captain set the parking brake as they waited for 
preceding traffic to clear.
N9011P was following N344PP along taxiway M and observed N344PP stop on the taxiway N5 
with its tail partially blocking taxiway M. After several minutes of waiting, N9011P requested 
permission to taxi past N344PP, which was granted. As the Captain of N9011P slowly taxied, 
the first officer (FO) attempted to visually monitor clearance between their airplanes wingtip 
and N344PPs horizontal stabilizer. The FO stated that he was temporarily blinded by the glare 
from the ramp lights and the airplanes collided. N9011P received minor damage to its right 
wingtip and the lower spar of N344PP's horizontal stabilizer was fractured.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=96472
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
