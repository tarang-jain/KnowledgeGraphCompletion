Location:
Huntingdon, TN
Accident Number:
ANC18LA013
Date & Time:

Registration:
N9730F
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172R

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On December 2, 2017, about 1330 central standard time, a Cessna 172 airplane, N9730F, 
sustained substantial damage during a forced landing following a total loss of engine power 
shortly after takeoff from Carroll County Airport (KHZD), Huntingdon, Tennessee. The 
airplane was registered to a private individual and operated by the pilot as a visual flight rules 
flight under the provisions of 14 
Code of Federal Regulations
 Part 91 when the accident 
occurred. The private pilot was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no 
flight plan had been filed.
The pilot reported that after completing the preflight inspection and the before takeoff 
checklist, he departed runway 01 from KHZD. Shortly after takeoff, during the initial climb, 
about midfield of the departure runway the engine lost all power. Unable to land on the 
remaining runway, he executed a 90° left turn, and selected a grass field as an off-airport 
landing site. During the forced landing the nose gear collapsed, and the airplane sustained 
substantial damage to the fuselage. 
The closest weather reporting facility was Carroll County Airport (KHZD), Huntingdon, 
Tennessee. At 1335, a METAR from KHZD was reporting, in part: wind calm; visibility, 10 
statute miles; clouds and sky condition, clear; temperature, 64 °F; dew point 18° F; altimeter, 
30.12 inches of mercury.
The airplane was equipped with a Lycoming IO-360 series engine; a detailed engine 
examination is pending.
