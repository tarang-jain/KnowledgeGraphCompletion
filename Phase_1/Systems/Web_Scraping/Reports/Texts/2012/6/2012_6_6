WPR12CA245
Date & Time:
06/02/2012, 1320 PDT 
Registration:
N3184D
Aircraft:
CESSNA 180
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that during the takeoff ground roll with a left crosswind condition, the 
airplane began to swerve immediately after the tail came off the ground and the left wing rose. 
The pilot attempted to correct with aileron, rudder, and control stick inputs, but the airplane 
turned into the wind and the right wing and propeller contacted the ground. The airplane 
subsequently came to rest balanced on its right main landing gear, the propeller, and the right 
wing tip. The airplane's right wing and right aileron were substantially damaged as a result of 
impact damage with the runway surface. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during takeoff in a crosswind condition.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
