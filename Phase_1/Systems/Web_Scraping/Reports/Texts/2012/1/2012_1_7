Analysis   
Prior to takeoff, the pilot forgot to properly latch the canopy. Shortly after rotation, the pilot 
noticed that the canopy had partially opened, which resulted in a distraction and a loss of 
airplane control. Subsequently, the airplane contacted the runway, and the landing gear 
collapsed. The airplane came to rest upright on the side of the runway. Postaccident 
examination of the airplane revealed that the fuselage was bent and buckled. The pilot reported 
no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded 
normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot did not maintain airplane control during takeoff due to his distraction with the 
improperly secured canopy, which he forgot to latch.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
