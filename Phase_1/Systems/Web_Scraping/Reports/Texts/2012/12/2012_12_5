Registration:

Aircraft:
BEECH B19
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion
Injuries:
3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The pilot reported that the purpose of the flight was an orientation for two potential student 
pilots. The pilot said that he completed a visual inspection of the fuel tanks and that he 
estimated that the fuel tanks contained 10 gallons of fuel, which he determined, would have 
been adequate for the flight. The pilot completed two traffic patterns, and as he climbed the 
airplane to the downwind leg of the third pattern, the engine lost power and "surged" during 
the subsequent forced landing. The pilot requested an emergency landing to runway 13 but 
amended his request to runway 8 because the airplane was "too high." He subsequently 
determined the airplane was "too low" for runway 8, and the airplane touched down hard on a 
taxiway and skidded to a stop in the grass infield. The airplane sustained substantial damage to 
the cabin floor structure. Examination revealed that the airplane contained no fuel, and the 
pilot reported that he had exhausted his fuel supply.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate preflight planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and a total loss of 
engine power.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
