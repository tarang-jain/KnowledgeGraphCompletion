N12KX
Aircraft:
CAMPBELL DAVID LEGACY

Substantial
Defining Event:
Abnormal runway contact
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that he lowered the landing gear and set the flaps to 30-degrees while on the 
downwind leg to the runway. He added that, as he lined up the airplane on final approach, the 
airplane drifted to the right. After the airplane crossed the beginning of the runway, the drift 
increased, and the pilot tried to correct back to the runway centerline. The pilot further stated 
that the airspeed decreased and the airplane ﬁstalled between five and ten feet above the 
runwayﬂ. The airplane landed hard, slid off the runway onto a glass slope, and came to rest in 
an upright position. Examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the fuselage, 
including separation of the empennage section, forward of the vertical stabilizer.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s improper flare and subsequent aerodynamic stall, which resulted in a hard landing.
Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
