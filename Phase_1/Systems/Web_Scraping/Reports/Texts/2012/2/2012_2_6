Analysis   
On February 3, 2012, about 1717 Pacific daylight time, SkyWest Airlines flight 6261, a 
Bombardier CL600-2B19, N912SW, was impacted by a belt loader at San Francisco 
International Airport, San Francisco, California, while parked at the gate and ready for 
pushback. There were no injuries to the passengers or crew members onboard and the airplane 
sustained substantial damage. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 121 
as a scheduled domestic passenger flight to Mahlon Sweet Field Airport, Eugene, Oregon.
After the boarding process was complete, the flight crew was informed that a belt loader had 
struck the airplane.  According to the operator, the driver of the belt loader that had been 
parked at the rear cargo door believed there was sufficient room between the loader and the 
airplane to make a forward right turn instead of backing up.  However, the front left corner of 
the loader impacted the airplane during the turn and caused substantial damage to the skin, 
stringers and a frame. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the driver's failure to ensure that the belt loader was clear of the airplane before turning.
Findings
Personnel issues
Incorrect action performance - Ground crew (Cause)

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=82833
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
