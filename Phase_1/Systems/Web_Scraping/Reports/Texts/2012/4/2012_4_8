Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Corpus Christi, TX
Accident Number:
CEN12LA228
Date & Time:
04/03/2012, 1555 CDT 
Registration:
N3042D
Aircraft:
ENSTROM 280FX
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Sys/Comp malf/fail (non-power)
Injuries:
1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Other Work Use
Analysis 
After an uneventful flight, the pilot slowed the helicopter into a stable hover about 15 feet 
above the landing point. Although the engine continued to operate, the main rotor rpm 
suddenly decayed and the helicopter landed hard. The pilot, who had over 5,600 flight hours in 
helicopters, stated that there was no warning before the loss of main rotor drive. The helicopter 
was in a position whereby power to the rotor system was essential to conducting a safe landing. 
Examination of the helicopter revealed that the bolt that retains the clutch drive rod end in the 
clutch pivot fork had sheared, resulting in the clutch disengaging. Once the clutch disengaged, 
there was no drive to the rotor system, and the helicopter's descent could not be arrested. With 
the exception of the failed bolt, examination of the entire drive system did not show any 
preexisting mechanical malfunction or abnormalities that would have precluded normal 
operation. The helicopter had operated about 1,350 hours since it was new, and the retaining 
bolt was the original installation. The reason for the failure of the bolt could not be determined.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the bolt that retained the clutch drive rod end, which resulted in a loss of main 
rotor drive and a subsequent hard landing.

Factual Information
On April 3, 2012, approximately 1555 central daylight time, an Enstrom 280FX helicopter, 
N3042D, registered to Travland Helicopters Intl INC., of Alpine, Texas, was substantially 
damaged during a hard landing after a loss of power at the Corpus Christie Airport (CRP), 
Corpus Christie, Texas. The commercial pilot received minor injuries and his passenger was 
not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed for the 
flight. The business flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 91. The flight originated from Edinburg, Texas, and Corpus Christie was its 
intended destination.
After an uneventful flight from Edinburg, Texas, and set up for landing at CRP, the pilot slowed 
the helicopter into a stable hover about 15 feet above the landing point, the rotor RPM 
suddenly decayed and the helicopter landed hard, resulting in substantial damage to the 
tailboom. The pilot, who had over 5,600 flight hours in helicopters, stated that there was no 
warning prior to the loss of main rotor drive. The helicopter was in a position whereby power 
to the rotor system was essential to effect a safe landing. 
Examination of the helicopter by an FAA inspector revealed that the bolt that retains the clutch 
drive rod end in the clutch pivot fork had sheared. The ears of the pivot fork were worn on the 
inside, but not bent. The rod end to the clutch drive was not bent. The bolt was elongated and 
the pivot fork bushing was worn. The head of the bolt was not found. Examination of the entire 
drive system did not show any preexisting mechanical malfunction or abnormalities. The bolt 
was the proper hardware for the installation. The helicopter had about 1,350 hours since it was 
new, and the retaining bolt was the original installation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
