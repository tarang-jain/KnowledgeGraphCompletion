Analysis   
The pilot stated that he was performing a touch-and-go landing. After touchdown, the pilot 
intended to retract the flaps, but inadvertently selected the landing gear control lever. The 
landing gear partially retracted, and the airplane settled onto the runway, resulting in 
substantial damage to a nose section bulkhead. A postaccident examination of the airplane 
revealed no evidence of any preexisting mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have 
precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadvertent retraction of the landing gear during the landing.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=84135
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
