Analysis 
THE AIRCRAFT DEPARTED FOR THE X-COUNTRY FLT IN IMC CONDITIONS. WHILE 
CLIMBING TO CRUISE, THE PLT EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF AIRCRAFT CONTROL 
FOLLOWED BY AN INFLIGHT SEPARATION OF BOTH WINGS AND THE EMPENNAGE. 
SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED ICE BLOCKING THE PITOT/STATIC TUBE. 
ICING FORECASTS WERE VALID FOR THE PERIOD COVERING THE TIME OF THE 
FLIGHT AND THE PLT HAD RECEIVED A BRIEFING REGARDING POSSIBLE ICE. 
ALTHOUGH THE PITOT HEAT TESTED TO BE OPERATIONAL WHEN CHECKED DURING 
A POST ACCIDENT EXAM, THE PITOT HEAT SWITCH WAS FOUND IN THE OFF 
POSITION AFTER THE ACCIDENT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE WEATHER FORECAST, HIS FAILURE TO 
UTILIZE THE PITOT HEAT IN ICING CONDITIONS AND THE EXCEEDING OF THE 
STRESS LIMITS OF THE AIRCRAFT.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
