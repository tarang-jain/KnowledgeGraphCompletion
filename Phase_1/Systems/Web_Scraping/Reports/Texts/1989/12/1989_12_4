Location:
Engadine, MI
Accident Number:
CHI90LA280
Date & Time:
12/01/1989, 2345 EST 
Registration:
N2440P
Aircraft:
Piper PA-22-150
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane impacted trees and the terrain in a heavily wooded swamp.  The airplane departed 
on a night cross country flight on December 1, 1989, and failed to arrive at its destination.   At 
2312, the pilot contacted a flight service station while en route for the forecast weather along 
his route.   At 2342, the pilot contacted the Minneapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center 
(ZMP) and stated that he was "a little disoriented and would like a [transponder] code and a 
heading toward Sault Ste Marie (ANJ), Michigan."  Two transponder codes were assigned to 
N2440P, but attempts to establish radar contact were not successful.  The last communication 
with N2440P was at 2345 when the pilot informed ZMP that their transmissions were "pretty 
weak."  A witness who reported seeing an airplane flying at tree-top level stated there was 
heavy snow in the area at the time.  The wreckage was located by hunters on October 12, 2002.  
The airplane descended through the trees for approximately 150 feet on a northeasterly 
heading prior to coming to rest in a nearly inverted attitude.  Flight control continuity was 
established.  The engine separated from the airframe at the engine mounts.  The engine was 
buried in the swamp with approximately 1 1/2 inches of one propeller blade being visible. 
There were no immediate plans to remove the wreckage from the swamp.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On December 1, 1989, a Piper PA-22-150, N2440P, operated by an Airline Transport Rated 
pilot collided with trees and the terrain in a heavily wooded area in Engadine, Michigan.  The 
pilot was fatally injured and the airplane was substantially damaged.  The 14 CFR Part 91 
personal flight was operating in both visual meteorological and instrument meteorological 
conditions along its proposed route of flight.  No flight plan was filed.  The flight originated 
from the Cheyboygan County Airport (SLH), Cheboygan, Michigan, en route to the Delta 
County Airport (ESC) Escanaba, Michigan.  
The airplane was reported as missing when the accident happened.  The wreckage was located 
by hunters on October 12, 2002.  The hunters reported finding the wreckage to the Michigan 
State Police on October 13, 2002.
According to the pilot's employer, the pilot's duty time on the day of the flight started at 0900 
and continued until 1500 when he took a two hour break.  At 1700 he resumed duty and flew a 
round trip to Erie, Pennsylvania, in a Piper Seneca.  He returned to Cheboygan sometime 
before 2300.
The employer last talked to the pilot just before 2300.  At that time, the pilot stated that he was 
going to try to fly to Escanaba and if the weather was bad, he would probably just return to 
Chippewa, Michigan, and drive to Escanaba in the morning.  
At 2312, N2440P contacted the Flight Service Station in Lansing, Michigan, and requested the 
forecast weather for Marquette, Michigan, and Green Bay, Wisconsin.  An intermittent 
dialogue concerning the weather and flight conditions along the proposed route continued 
until 2317.
At 2342, N2440P contacted the Minneapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZMP) and 
stated that he was "a little disoriented and would like a [transponder] code and a heading 
toward Sault Ste Marie (ANJ), Michigan."  Two transponder codes were assigned to N2440P, 
but attempts to establish radar contact were not successful.  The last communication with 
N2440P was at 2345 when the pilot informed ZMP that their transmissions were "pretty 
weak." 
A witness who was driving west on US 2, approximately 4.5 miles west of Naubinway, 
Michigan, reported seeing a low flying airplane that matched the description of N2440P 
around 2330.  She reported the airplane was traveling west at tree-top level.  She stated it was 
snowing heavily at the time and the wind was blowing off the lake.  Naubinway is 
approximately 5 miles east of the accident site.
On December 2, 1989, at 0600, the Director of Operations for Midwest Flying Service, received 
a telephone call from the pilot's wife inquiring as to the whereabouts of her husband.  After the 
telephone conversation, the director went to the airport and found that the pilot's airplane was 
not in the hangar.  He then reported the airplane overdue and a search was initiated.  
On December 2, 1989, at 1040, the USAF opened a search mission for N2440P.  Elements of 
the Michigan and Wisconsin Civil Air Patrol, the U.S.Coast Guard, and USAF 305th Air Rescue 
Squadron participated in the search.  There were 101 sorties flown, totaling 279 hours, in 
support of the mission.  The search was suspended on December 22, 1989.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
An inspector from the Federal Aviation Administration Flight Standards District Office in 
Grand Rapids, Michigan, inspected the accident site on October 22, 2002.
The main wreckage was located in a heavily wooded cedar swamp.  A global positioning system 
(GPS) receiver recorded the position of the main wreckage as 46-degrees 09-minutes 16.9-
seconds north latitude, 85-degrees 39-minutes 49.1-seconds west longitude.  
The inspector reported the airplane descended through the trees for approximately 150 feet on 
a northeasterly heading prior to coming to rest in a near inverted attitude.  The airplane 
sustained substantial impact damage.  Both wings and the tail remained attached to the 
fuselage.  Flight control continuity to both ailerons, the elevator, and the rudder was 
established.  The engine separated from the airframe at the engine mounts.  The engine was 
buried in the swamp with approximately 1 1/2 inches of one propeller blade being visible. 
There were no immediate plans to remove the wreckage from the swamp.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
Positive identification of the pilot was made by the Mackinac County Medical Examiner's

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
