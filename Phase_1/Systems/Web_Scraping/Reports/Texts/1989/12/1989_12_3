Analysis 
BEFORE THE FLIGHT, A STUDENT PILOT INQUIRED IF HE COULD ACCOMPANY THE 
PILOT ON THE FLIGHT, AND THE PILOT CONSENTED. THE PILOT ADJUSTED THE 
THROTTLE AND BEGAN TO START THE ENGINE BY HAND-PROPPING IT. MEANWHILE, 
THE PASSENGER/STUDENT PILOT BOARDED THE TAYLORCRAFT. THE ENGINE 
STARTED, THE PLANE BEGAN MOVING FORWARD, AND THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO 
ARREST ITS MOVEMENT BY GRABBING THE LEFT WING STRUT. THE PLANE THEN 
PIVOTED AROUND THE PILOT AND COLLIDED WITH A PARKED AIRCRAFT. AN 
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE THROTTLE WAS EASY TO MOVE. THE PILOT AND AN 
FAA INSPECTOR CONCLUDED THAT THE PASSENGER/STUDENT PILOT MUST HAVE 
'BUMPED' THE THROTTLE AS HE ENTERED THE COCKPIT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO PROPERLY SECURE THE AIRCRAFT AND/OR ADEQUATELY 
BRIEF THE PASSENGER (STUDENT PILOT), AND INADVERTENT BUMPING OF THE

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
