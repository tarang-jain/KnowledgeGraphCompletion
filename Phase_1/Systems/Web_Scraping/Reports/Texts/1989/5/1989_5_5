Aviation Incident Final Report
Location:
MINNEAPOLIS, MN
Incident Number:
CHI89IA083
Date & Time:
05/02/1989, 1440 CDT 
Registration:
N434AA
Aircraft:
MCDONNELL DOUGLAS DC-9-82
Aircraft Damage:
Minor
Defining Event:
Injuries:
96 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 121: Air Carrier - Scheduled
Analysis 
THE FLIGHT CREW REPORTED THAT WHILE IN CRUISE FLIGHT AT 33,000 FEET, THEY 
EXPERIENCED A HYDRAULIC SYSTEM FAILURE. THEY MANUALLY EXTENDED THE 
LANDING GEAR FOR LANDING AND MADE AN UNEVENTFUL NO FLAPS/NO SLATS 
LANDING. POST-ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE LOSS OF 
HYDRAULIC PRESSURE IN BOTH SYSTEMS WAS DUE TO THE FAILURE OF PTU S/O 
VALVE BODY ATTACH SCREWS ON THE LEFT SYSTEM VALVE. THIS ALLOWED THE 
LEFT VALVE BODY TO SEPERATE FROM THE REMAINING ASSEMBLY, PORTING LEFT 
SYSTEM HYDRAULIC FLUID OVERBOARD, AND SUBSEQUENTLY DEPRESSURIZING 
THE RIGHT SYSTEM (ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO LOSS OF RIGHT SYSTEM 
HYDRAULIC FLUID). THE MANUFACTURER HAD A RE-DESIGNED, STRONGER UNIT 
AVAILABLE TO OPERATORS; THIS IMPROVED UNIT HAD STRONGER VALVE BODY 
ATTACH SCREWS, WELDED VALVE BODIES, STEEL GEARS, AND A SHEAR PIN IN THE 
MOTOR-TO-VALVE GEAR TRAIN. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
FAILURE OF THE HYDRAULIC POWER TRANSFER UNIT SHUT-OFF (PTU S/O) VALVE 
DUE TO FAILED (FATIGUED) VALVE BODY ATTACH SCREWS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
