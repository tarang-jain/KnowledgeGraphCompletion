Analysis 
THE AIRPLANE STALLED AND CRASHED SHORTLY AFTER A DOWNWIND TOUCH & GO 
LDG. THE PLT REPORTED THAT HE DID NOT CHECK THE ARPT WINDSOCK PRIOR TO 
THE LDG. THE AIRPLANE TOUCHED DOWN ABOUT 1/3 DOWN THE 3,500 FT RWY 
WITH FULL FLAPS (40 DEGREES). THE PLT THEN INITIATED T/O BY FIRST ADDING 
POWER. BEFORE HE COULD RAISE THE FLAPS THE AIRPLANE BECAME AIRBORNE & 
CLIMBED TO ABOUT 100 FT. HE THEN ELECTED TO LEAVE THE FLAPS DOWN 
BECAUSE OF LOW AIRSPEED AND THE POSSIBILITY OF STALLING. THE AIRPLANE 
BEGAN TO DESCEND, AND SUBSEQUENTLY IMPACTED THE GROUND WITH THE RT 
MAIN & NOSE LDG GEAR ABOUT 300 YDS SOUTH OF THE ARPT. A WITNESS REPORTED 
THAT THE AIRPLANE MAINTAINED A HIGH ANGLE OF ATTACK AS IT DESCENDED. 
THE PILOT NOTED THAT THE WIND HAD BEEN BLOWING FROM THE OPPOSITE 
DIRECTION EARLIER IN THE FLT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO RETRACT THE FLAPS PRIOR TO ADDING POWER FOR 
TAKEOFF RESULTING IN A PREMATURE LIFT-OFF, AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO 
MAINTIAN CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE AFTER LIFT-OFF WHICH RESULTED IN A 
STALL/MUSH.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
