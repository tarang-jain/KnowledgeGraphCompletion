Analysis 
THE RGT WING OF BLANIK L-13, N82756, HIT THE LEFT WING OF ANOTHER GLIDER 
(LS-1), WHICH WAS PARKED NEAR THE RGT EDGE OF THE RWY, AS THE BLANIK WAS 
STARTING TO BE LAUNCHED BEHIND A TOW PLANE. ACCORDING TO THE WING 
WALKER, HE HAD HOOKED THE TOW ROPE TO THE BLANIK & WAS LIFTING THE 
(RGT) WING, WHEN HE REALIZED THE LS-1 WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE RWY. HE SAID 
HE PUT THE WING DOWN & SHOUTED FOR A RELEASE AS HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT, 
BUT THE BLANIK PLT FANNED THE RUDDER TO SIGNAL THE TOW PLT FOR THE 
LAUNCH TO BEGIN. ACCORDING TO THE BLANIK PLT, THE WING WALKER HAD 
RAISED THE WING (A SIGNAL TO BGN THE LAUNCH), THEN TRIED TO STOP THE 
LAUNCH, BUT DID NOT USE THE PROPER 'CUT' SIGNAL. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE 
LAUNCH BEGAN & THE BLANIK VEERED SLIGHTLY RGT & HIT THE LS-1 BEFORE THE 
BLANIK PLT RELEASED THE TOW ROPE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
INADEQUATE CREW COORDINATION BETWEEN THE GROUND LINEMAN AND THE 
BLANIK PILOT,  AND FAILURE OF THE  BLANIK PILOT TO MAINTAIN CLEARANCE 
BETWEEN HIS AIRCRAFT AND THE PARKED GLIDER.  A FACTOR RELATED TO THE 
ACCIDENT WAS THE PROXIMITY OF THE PARKED GLIDER TO THE RUNWAY.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
