Location:
MANISTIQUE, MI
Accident Number:
CHI90LA001
Date & Time:

Registration:
N102AT
Aircraft:
CESSNA 177
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:

4 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
AFTER LANDING LONG, THE PLT ELECTED TO GO-AROUND. HE RETRACTED THE 
FLAPS TO FULL UP & THE ACFT STOPPED CLIMBING & STARTED SETTLING WITH THE 
STALL WARNING HORN SOUNDING. THE PLT OBSERVED WIRES IN HIS FLT PATH & 
ROTATED THE PLANE TO AN ATTITUDE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE WIRE TO STRIKE 
THE ACFT'S BELLY, RATHER THAN ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD. AFTER THE WIRE 
STRIKE, THE ACFT DESCENDED OUT OF CONTROL & COLLIDED WITH THE TERRAIN. 
ACCORDING TO THE GO-AROUND PROCEDURE IN THE FLT MANUAL, THE FLAPS 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN RETRACTED TO ONLY 20 DEG UNTIL THE ACFT HAD 
ACCELERATED TO 75 MPH, THEN FURTHER FLAP RETRACTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
PERFORMED SLOWLY. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A DELAYED BY THE PILOT IN GOING AROUND AND HIS FAILURE TO OBTAIN 
ADEQUATE AIRSPEED BEFORE FULLY RETRACTING THE FLAPS, WHICH ALLOWED 
THE AIRCRAFT TO MUSH. THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE: THE PILOT'S 
FAILURE TO ATTAIN THE PROPER TOUCHDOWN POINT DURING THE LANDING AND 
THE TRANSMISSION WIRE.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
