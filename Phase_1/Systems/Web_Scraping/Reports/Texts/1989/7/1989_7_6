Analysis 
THE PLT RPRTD THAT AS HE WAS LANDING, THE AIRPLANE ENCOUNTERED A 
STRONG GUST OF WIND WHICH BLEW IT TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RWY. DENSITY 
ALTITUDE AT THE ARPT WAS 11,600 FT. THE PLT ATTEMPTED A GO-AROUND, BUT 
WAS UNABLE TO GET THE ACFT TO CLEAR OVER TREES. THE ACFT THEN CRASHED 
TO THE GROUND & CAME TO REST INVERTED WITH ITS TAIL & LEFT WING TORN OFF. 
THE FIXED BASE OPERATOR AT THE ARPT ESTIMATED THE WIND WAS FROM 240 
DEG AT 7 KTS. THE ARPT DIRECTORY RECOMMENDED THAT LANDINGS BE MADE ON 
RWY 9 & TAKEOFFS BE MADE ON RWY 27 FOR NOISE ABATEMENT REASONS. LOCAL 
PILOTS RPRTD THAT SUDDEN STRONG GUSTS ARE OFTEN ENCOUNTERED DRG 
LANDINGS AT THIS ARPT. A PLT, WHO LANDED JUST AFTER THE ACDNT, ALSO 
ENCOUNTERED UNFAVORABLE WIND NEAR THE APCH END OF RWY 9. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
INADEQUATE COMPENSATION FOR WIND CONDITIONS BY THE PILOT AND HIS 
FAILURE TO MAINTAIN RUNWAY ALIGNMENT. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE WIND 
CONDITIONS, HIGH DENSITY ALTITUDE, AND TREES.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
