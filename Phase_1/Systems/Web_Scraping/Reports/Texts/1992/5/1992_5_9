Analysis 
 THE PILOT WAS ATTEMPTING A HIGH SPEED TAXI TEST WHEN THE AIRPLANE 
BECAME AIRBORNE. A NORMAL CLIMB WAS MADE TO APPROXIMATELY 1,000 FEET 
AGL. THE PILOT MADE SEVERAL LEFT TURNS WHILE IN LEVEL FLIGHT AND 
PROCEEDED BACK TOWARD THE AIRPORT. DURING THE APPROACH, THE 
PROPELLER SYSTEM'S VARIABLE CONTROL MECHANISM SLIPPED WHICH ALLOWED 
THE PROPELLER TO GO TO THE FULL FEATHER POSITION. THE AIRPLANE'S 
AIRSPEED WAS BETWEEN 160 TO 180 MPH WHEN THIS OCCURRED, ACCORDING TO 
THE PILOT. THE AIRSPEED THEN DROPPED TO APPROXIMATELY 100 MPH AND THE 
PILOT INITIATED A FORCED LANDING TO AN OPEN FIELD. DURING THE FLARE PRIOR 
TO TOUCHDOWN, THE PILOT ADDED POWER AND THE AIRPLANE YAWED. THE LEFT 
WING TIP STRUCK THE GROUND AND THE PILOT LOST CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE 
WHICH THEN IMPACTED THE TERRAIN. THE PILOT STATED THE PROPELLER 
CONTROL SYSTEM PROBABLY VIBRATED LOOSE DURING THE FLIGHT. THIS SYSTEM 
IS CONTROLLED BY THE PILOT FROM THE COCKPIT WITH A VERNIER KNOB. THE 
PILOT BUILT THE AIRPLANE AND HAD NOT FLOWN IT BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AIRCRAFT CONTROL DURING THE FLARE. 
FACTORS WERE THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE PROPELLER FEATHERING SYSTEM AND 
THE PILOT'S TOTAL LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN TYPE AIRCRAFT AND THE SLIPPED 
PROPELLER PITCH CHANGE SYSTEM.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
