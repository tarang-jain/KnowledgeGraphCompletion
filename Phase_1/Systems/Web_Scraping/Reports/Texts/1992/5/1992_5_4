Analysis 
 THE AIRCRAFT WAS TOPPED OFF TO 540 POUNDS OF FUEL AT A TACH TIME OF 
3908.8 HOURS AND SUBSEQUENTLY FLOWN TO A TACH TIME OF 3911.4 HOURS. THE 
AIRCRAFT WAS NOT FUELED AND SUBSEQUENTLY DEPARTED FOR PORTLAND 
RETURNING TO BOISE AFTER A TACH TIME OF 0.4 HOURS DUE TO THE RIGHT MAIN 
LANDING GEAR'S FAILURE TO RETRACT. THE PIC THEN OPTED TO DEPART AND FLY 
NONSTOP TO PORTLAND WITH THE GEAR FULLY EXTENDED. THE AIRCRAFT WAS 
NOT FUELED SUBSEQUENT TO THE 0.4 HOUR FLIGHT. THE AIRCRAFT DEPARTED A 
SECOND TIME FOR PORTLAND AT 1808 HOURS PDT AND LATER REPORTED 
CONSUMING 110 POUNDS/HOUR OF FUEL. AT 1936 HOURS, AND AFTER DISCUSSING 
AVAILABLE FUELING FACILITIES WITH REDMOND FSS, THE PIC DIVERTED FROM HIS 
ROUTE OF FLIGHT TOWARDS REDMOND FOR FUEL. AT APPROXIMATELY 1950 HOURS 
THE PILOT RADIOED TO REDMOND FSS THAT HE HAD RUN OUT OF FUEL AND WAS 
EXECUTING A FORCED LANDING. DUSK LIGHT CONDITIONS EXISTED DURING THE 
FORCED LANDING AND THE PIC DID NOT SEE THE CANAL AND DIRT BANK IN HIS 
LANDING PATH UNTIL AFTER HE WAS COMMITTED TO THE LANDING SITE. DURING 
THE LANDING ROLL THE NOSE GEAR STRUCK THE DIRT BANK AND SEPARATED AND 
THE AIRCRAFT NOSED OVER. THE TACH TIME AT THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS 3913.6 
HOURS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE PILOT IN COMMAND DELAYING HIS DECISION TO DIVERT FOR FUEL, 
OVERLOADING OF THE NOSE GEAR STRUT AND THE PILOT IN COMMAND'S INABILITY 
TO MAINTAIN AIRCRAFT CONTROL SUBSEQUENT TO THE NOSE WHEEL SEPARATION.  
FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WERE:  THE PILOT IN COMMAND'S 
OPERATION OF THE AIRCRAFT WITH THE GEAR EXTENDED, HIS MISJUDGMENT OF 
THE FUEL SUPPLY, DUSK LIGHT CONDITIONS DURING THE FORCED LANDING, AND 
THE DIRT BANK.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
