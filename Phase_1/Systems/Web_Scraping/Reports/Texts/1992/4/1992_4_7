Analysis 
 ONE OF 3 AVID AIRCRAFT MARK IV'S IN A CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT ENCOUNTERED A 
TOTAL POWER LOSS WHILE CRUISING AT 8500 FEET MSL.  THE PILOT WAS UNABLE 
TO RESTART THE ENGINE AND EXECUTED A FORCED LANDING ON SNOW COVERED 
TERRAIN DURING WHICH THE AIRCRAFT NOSED OVER.  THE AIRCRAFT HAD 
SUSTAINED A SIMILAR POWER LOSS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY'S FLIGHT AND THE 
ENGINE DRIVEN PULSE TYPE FUEL PUMP HAD BEEN REPLACED 147 HOURS 
PREVIOUS IN ANOTHER POWER LOSS OCCURRENCE.  THE PILOT REPORTED THAT 
INSUFFICIENT FUEL PUMP PRESSURE RESULTED IN FUEL STARVATION AND THE 
SUBSEQUENT POWER LOSS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE FUEL PUMP DELIVERING TOO LOW FUEL PRESSURE.  A FACTOR CONTRIBUTING 
TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE SNOW COVERED TERRAIN.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
