Analysis 
 THE CERTIFICATED AIRLINE TRANSPORT PILOT AND A PASSENGER WERE 
CONDUCTING A LOW LEVEL FLIGHT OVER MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN. THE SURFACE 
WIND CONDITIONS WERE REPORTED TO BE FROM THE SOUTH AT OR ABOVE 20 
KNOTS.  THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE APPROACHED THE MOUNTAIN PEAK IN A 
SOUTHERLY DIRECTION AND CLIMBED THE AIRPLANE TO AN ALTITUDE OF 150 FEET 
ABOVE THE GROUND TO CLEAR THE MOUNTAIN.  THE AIRPLANE ENCOUNTERED 
DOWNDRAFT CONDITIONS ON THE LEE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN.  THE PILOT FAILED 
TO IMMEDIATELY CORRECT FOR THIS CONDITION AND THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED 
WITH THE UPSLOPING MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN WHEN THE PILOT WAS EXECUTING 
A 180 DEGREE TURN. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE PILOT'S INADEQUATE IN-FLIGHT PLANNING, IMPROPER ALTITUDE, AND 
DELAYING THE REQUIRED REMEDIAL ACTION TO PREVENT THE COLLISION WITH 
THE MOUNTAIN. CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE UNFAVORABLE WIND 
AND DOWNDRAFT CONDITIONS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
