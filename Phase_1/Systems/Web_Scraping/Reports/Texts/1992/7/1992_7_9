Analysis 
 DURING A CERTIFICATION TEST FLIGHT INVOLVING A SERIES OF DESCENTS AT LOW 
ROTOR RPM AND LOW AIRSPEEDS, THE ENGINE OF THE PROTOTYPE HELICOPTER 
LOST POWER.  AN AUTOROTATION WAS INITIATED AND THE AIRCRAFT IMPACTED 
THE GROUND IN A TAIL LOW CONDITION, CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE TAIL ROTOR 
AND MAIN ROTOR.  THE AIRCRAFT WAS BEING OPERATED AT A HIGH GROSS WEIGHT 
AND AFT CENTER OF GRAVITY TO MEET CERTIFICATION CRITERIA.  THE RIGGING 
BETWEEN THE THROTTLE AND FUEL CONTROL UNIT WAS EXAMINED AND FOUND 
TO BE IMPROPERLY SET, CAUSING THE PREVENTION OF CONTINUOUS ENGINE 
POWER THROUGHOUT THE FLIGHT TEST PROFILE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 FUEL STARVATION AS A RESULT OF IMPROPER RIGGING OF THE FUEL CONTROL

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
