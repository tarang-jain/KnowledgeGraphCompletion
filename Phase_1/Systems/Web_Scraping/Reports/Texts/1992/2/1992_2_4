Analysis 
 WHILE DESCENDING TO LAND, THE ENG QUIT.  ATTEMPTS TO RESTART WERE 
UNSUCCESSFUL.  THE ACFT COLLIDED WITH TREES DURING THE LANDING ROLL 
FOLLOWING THE FORCED LANDING.  THE ACFT WAS RECOVERED & TAKEN TO A 
FACILITY WHERE THE ENG WAS REMOVED FOR EXAMINATION.  EXAMINATION OF 
THE ENGINE REVEALED THAT THE CRANKSHAFT FAILED NEAR THE REAR MAIN 
BEARING. ALSO, EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE REAR MAIN BEARING SPUN IN ITS 
SUPPORT AND WAS PARTIALLY EXTRUDED INTO THE ACCESSORY SECTION.  
EXAMINATION OF THE CRANKCASE HALVES ADJACENT TO THE REAR MAIN BEARING 
INDICATED FRETTING. THE ENG HAD ACCUMULATED 174 HRS SINCE NEW.  
METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE CRANKSHAFT REVEALED THAT IT FAILED 
DUE TO HIGH CYCLE FATIGUE. 
Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
