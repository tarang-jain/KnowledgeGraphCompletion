Location:
SKAGWAY, AK
Accident Number:
ANC93LA077
Date & Time:
06/02/1993, 1455 AKD 
Registration:
N8127K
Aircraft:
PIPER PA-32-300
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
3 Minor, 2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Non-scheduled
Analysis 
ABOUT 15 MIN AFTER DEPARTING SKAGWAY, WHILE MANEUVERING OVER A 
GLACIER, THE PILOT NOTED DECREASING ENGINE OIL PRESSURE. SHORTLY 
THEREAFTER THE ENGINE BEGAN TO EMIT METALLIC SOUNDS, AND THEN THE 
ENGINE QUIT. AN EMERGENCY LANDING WAS MADE ON THE GLACIER. ON-SCENE 
EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED THAT THE #2 CYLINDER CONNECTING 
ROD HAD FAILED. SUBSEQUENT METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION BY THE SAFETY 
BOARD REVEALED THAT THE FRACTURE OF THE ROD THROUGH THE STRAP AREA 
ADJACENT TO THE HEAD OF THE ROD BOLT DISPLAYED FEATURES TYPICAL OF A 
FATIGUE FRACTURE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER AS A RESULT OF A FATIGUE FAILURE OF THE #2 
CONNECTING ROD. A FACTOR WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE 
LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN FOR THE EMERGENCY LANDING.

Factual Information
 On June 2, 1993, at 1455 Alaska daylight time, a fixed gear wheel equipped Piper PA 32 300 
airplane, N8127K, owned and operated by Skagway Air Service, Inc., experienced a loss of 
engine power while maneuvering near Davidson Glacier, approximately 23 miles south of 
Skagway, Alaska.  The commercial certificated pilot in command and one of the four revenue 
passengers on board the airplane were not injured.  The remaining three passengers received 
minor injuries and the airplane sustained substantial damage during the emergency landing on 
the glacier.  The airplane was being operated as a 14 CFR Part 135 on demand air taxi 
sightseeing flight by Skagway Air Service, Inc. when the accident occurred.  The flight 
originated in Skagway at approximately 1435.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at 
the time and a VFR flight plan was on file with the Juneau Flight Service Station.  
The pilot told the Safety Board investigator in charge that prior to departing Skagway, he 
observed nothing out of the ordinary during his  preflight of the airplane and operational check 
of the engine shortly before departure.  The oil sump had 9 plus quarts of oil and the oil filler 
cap was properly secured.   About 15 minutes after departing Skagway, as he was maneuvering 
over the glacier at an altitude of approximately 3500 to 4000 feet msl (1000 ft. agl), he glanced 
at the engine gauges and observed a decreasing oil pressure indication.  Approximately four 
seconds later, the engine began to vibrate and emit metallic sounds then quit.  An emergency 
landing was performed on the glacier.  
An on scene examination of the engine by a Federal Aviation Safety Inspector disclosed a 
failure of the number two cylinder connecting rod.  
The engine, a Textron Lycoming IO540-KIG5, S/N L-11897-48A, was shipped to the Textron 
Lycoming Reciprocating Engine Division in Williamsport, Pennsylvania for disassembly and 
inspection under the scrutiny of FAA personnel from the Flight Standards District Office 
(FSDO) in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  The piston end portion of the number two cylinder 
connecting rod remained with the piston and was shipped with the engine assembly.  A portion 
of the number two cylinder rod end, rod cap and bolts were shipped to the NTSB's Materials 
Laboratory Division in Washington, D.C. for examination.  
The engine inspection revealed that the top of the engine crankcase was broken above the 
number two cylinder, exposing a broken number two connecting rod.  The camshaft was 
broken directly above the number two connecting rod.  The disassembly inspection revealed 
that the remaining connecting rods exhibited moderate to severe levels of galling.  Likewise, 
the connecting rod caps also exhibited galling.  The piston portion of the number two cylinder 
connecting rod exhibited a failure due to overload.  (Note. See attached engine disassembly 
inspection report)
The examination of the end portion of the rod, the rod cap and bolts revealed, impart, that the 
fractures of the rod cap exhibited bending overstress features.  The bolt fracture was indicative 
of a tensile overstress separation.  The fracture of the rod through the strap area adjacent to the 
head of the bolt displayed features typical of a fatigue fracture.  None of the components 
exhibited any indications of high temperature exposure.  High magnification inspections of the 
rod fracture revealed bench marking indicating fatigue progression away from a single point of 
initiation on the bearing surface of the rod.  (Note. See attached Metallurgist's Factual Report)     
A search of the FAA's Integrated Safety Information Subsystem (ISIS) for Service Difficulty 
Page 4 of 6ANC93LA077
Information (SDR's) files on the PA-32-300 with a IO540-K1G5 engine did not produce "rod 
failure" as a previously reported problem.  
Company maintenance records indicate that the engine was overhauled by Textron Lycoming 
in June 1990 and was installed on N8127K on July 30, 1990.  The most recent combined 
annual/100 hour inspection was performed on the engine on January 10, 1993.  At the time of 
the accident, the engine had accrued a total time of 1,229.7 hours since the factory overhaul 
and 41.5 hours since the January inspection.  There was no record or indication that the engine 
had been disassembled since overhaul by the factory.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
