Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
WOODSTOCK, GA
Accident Number:
ATL93LA099
Date & Time:
06/01/1993, 0920 EDT 
Registration:
N116RC
Aircraft:
Rockwell 114
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE PILOT ABORTED THE TAKEOFF FROM THE SOD STRIP WHEN THE AIRPLANE DID 
NOT APPEAR TO ACCELERATE SUFFICIENTLY TO EXECUTE A SAFE TAKEOFF.  THE 
AIRPLANE CONTINUED OFF THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY AND COLLIDED 
WITH TERRAIN. EXAMINATION OF THE AIRCRAFT FAILED TO DISCLOSE ANY 
MECHANICAL PROBLEMS, NOR DID THE PILOT REPORT AN AIRCRAFT PROBLEM.  
ACCORDING TO THE AIRCRAFT FLIGHT MANUAL, AT GROSS WEIGHT, 
APPROXIMATELY 2100 FEET OF RUNWAY IS NEEDED FOR A NORMAL TAKEOFF FROM 
A DRY SOD RUNWAY; THE RUNWAY WAS 3100 FEET LONG. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S INADEQUATE PREFLIGHT PLANNING WHICH RESULTED IN HIS FAILURE 
TO ABORT THE TAKEOFF WHEN SUFFICIENT RUNWAY WAS AVAILABLE. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: OVERRUN
Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - ABORTED
Findings
1. (C) ABORTED TAKEOFF - DELAYED - PILOT IN COMMAND
2. (C) PREFLIGHT PLANNING/PREPARATION - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND

Factual Information
 On June 1, 1993 at 0920 eastern daylight time, a Rockwell Commander 114, N116RC, collided 
with the ground as the pilot rejected a takeoff from Air Acres Airport, Woodstock, Georgia. The 
flight operated under 14 CFR Part 91 with no flight plan filed. Visual weather conditions 
prevailed at the time of the accident. The airplane sustained substantial damage and the pilot 
was not injured. The accident occurred during the initial takeoff from Woodstock.
According to the pilot, he rejected the takeoff when the airplane did not appear to accelerate 
sufficiently to execute a safe lift off from the 3100-foot sod airstrip. The airplane continued off 
the departure end of the north runway and collided with the ground. Examination of the 
accident site and airplane failed to disclose a mechanical problem with the airplane. According 
to the flight manual for the Rockwell Commander 114, approximately 2100 feet of runway 
surface is needed for a normal takeoff from a sod surface. 
The pilot failed to complete NTSB Form 6120.1/2, Pilot Aircraft Accident Report, as requested. 
(See attached Certified Return Receipts for NTSB Form 6120. 1/2 delivered to pilot's home 
address. Additionally, the pilot confirmed during a telephone conversation, that he had 
received the mailed NTSB Form and requested a faxed copy of NTSB Form 6120.1/2.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
