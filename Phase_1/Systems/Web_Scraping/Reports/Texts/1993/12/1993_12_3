Part 91: General Aviation - Ferry
Analysis 
THE PILOT OF AN AGRICULTURAL AIRPLANE EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF ENGINE 
POWER WHILE THE AIRPLANE WAS ON INITIAL TAKEOFF CLIMB. THE PILOT STATED 
THAT DUE TO HIS LOW AIRSPEED AND ALTITUDE, HE ELECTED TO LAND STRAIGHT 
AHEAD IN AN OPEN WHEAT FIELD. THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER AS THE MAIN 
LANDING GEAR TIRES DUG INTO THE SOFT GROUND, AND THE AIRPLANE CAME TO 
REST IN THE INVERTED POSITION. A DETAILED EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE AND 
ITS COMPONENTS FAILED TO PRODUCE ANY MECHANICAL PROBLEM THAT WOULD 
HAVE PREVENTED NORMAL ENGINE OPERATION. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS. A FACTOR WAS 
THE LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN AVAILABLE TO THE PILOT FOR THE FORCED 
LANDING.

Factual Information
 On December 1, 1993, at 0901 central standard time, a Grumman G-164A, N4582, was 
substantially damaged during a forced landing near Parkin, Arkansas.  The commercial pilot 
was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the ferry flight.
According to the operator, the purpose of the flight was to ferry the agricultural airplane to a 
nearby airstrip to wash and clean the airplane.  The operator was told by the pilot that the loss 
of power occurred as the airplane was over the departure end of the 1,700 foot airstrip, at 
approximately 50 to 60 feet above the ground.  The pilot further stated that due to his altitude 
and airspeed, he elected to land straight ahead in an open wheat field.
The airplane nosed over, coming to rest in the inverted position.  Damage to the airplane 
included structural damage to the upper airfoil, fracturing of the rudder and vertical stabilizer, 
and compression damage to the engine cowling.
A detailed examination of the engine by the owner did not reveal any mechanical defects or 
anomalies that would have prevented normal engine operation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
