Analysis 
THE AIRPLANE EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF ENGINE POWER WHILE ON FINAL 
APPROACH FOR LANDING. THE PILOT MADE A FORCED LANDING AND THE AIRPLANE 
NOSED OVER ON LANDING ROLLOUT. THE PILOT STATED ON BASE LEG THE 
CARBURETOR HEAT WAS TURNED ON. THE ENGINE STARTED SPUTTERING ON FINAL 
APPROACH, POWER WAS INCREASED, AND THE CARBURETOR HEAT WAS TURNED 
OFF, ON, AND THE ENGINE QUIT. REVIEW OF THE PROBABILITY ICING CHART 
REVEALED THE ENGINE WOULD ENCOUNTER SERIOUS ICING AT GLIDE POWER 
BASED ON THE WEATHER OBSERVATION AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S IMPROPER USE OF CARBURETOR HEAT DURING A VFR 
APPROACH FOR LANDING. THIS RESULTED IN A LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DUE TO 
FUEL SYSTEM CARBURETOR ICING.

Factual Information
 On December 2, 1993, at about 1550 eastern standard time, a Cessna 150M, registered to 
David Byers, operated by Professional Aviation, as a 14 CFR Part 91 instructional flight, 
experienced a loss of engine power on final approach for landing. The student pilot made a 
forced landing, and the airplane nosed over on landing roll. The airplane sustained substantial 
damage, and the pilot was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a VFR 
flight plan was filed. The flight originated from Okeechobee, Florida, about 50 minutes before 
the accident.
     The student pilot stated in a telephone conversation with the NTSB investigator-in-charge, 
that she departed Punta Gorda in the morning at about 0930. She made three intermediate 
stops, and refueled at two of the stops before departing Okeechobee, Florida, at 1500 for Punta 
Gorda. Upon arrival she entered an extended downwind for runway 09 due to traffic. The 
before landing check was completed on base leg and the carburetor heat was turned on. At 
about 600 feet agl after turning to final approach, the engine started sputtering. The power was 
increased with no noticeable response. The carburetor heat was turned off and turned back on, 
and the engine quit. A distress call was made and a forced landing was initiated. The airplane 
touched down on  a road that was perpendicular to the final approach. When the nose gear 
touched down, the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted.
     Examination of the engine assembly and accessories by the FAA revealed no evidence of a 
precrash failure or malfunction. The FAA aviation safety inspector stated in a written 
statement, "The failure of this engine was due to apparent carburetor icing."
     Review of the probability carburetor icing chart revealed that the engine would encounter 
serious icing at glide power based on the weather observation at the time of the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
