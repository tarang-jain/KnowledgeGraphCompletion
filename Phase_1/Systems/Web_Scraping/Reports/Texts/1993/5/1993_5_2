Analysis 
SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF, BOTH ENGINES LOST POWER. THE PILOT SAID HE 
SELECTED DIFFERENT FUEL TANKS, BUT COULD NOT RESTART THE ENGINES. HE 
SUBSEQUENTLY MADE A WHEELS-UP FORCED LANDING IN A FIELD BELOW HIS 
FLIGHT PATH. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE HAD PERFORMED A PREFLIGHT 
INSPECTION AND THAT THERE WAS 4.1 GALS IN BOTH THE FRONT LEFT AND RIGHT 
MAIN FUEL TANKS. EXAMINATION OF THE AIRPLANE AFTER THE ACCIDENT 
REVEALED A COMBINED TOTAL OF ABOUT 5 GALS IN THE FORWARD LEFT AND 
RIGHT TANKS. THE OTHER FOUR TANKS WERE EMPTY. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE 
HAD LOST TRACK OF THE FLIGHTS FLOWN THAT DAY AND DID NOT VISUALLY CHECK 
THE FUEL. HE ALSO STATED THAT HE '...RAN THE AIRPLANE OUT OF FUEL.' 
ACCORDING TO BEECH, ALL FUEL IN THE AIRPLANE IS USABLE EXCEPT FOR A 
COMBINED 6 GALS IN THE LEFT AND RIGHT FORWARD TANKS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
