The airplane was lying on its top with the front of the airplane headed west northwest.  There 
was a six inch deep crater where the propeller, engine, engine cowling, and nosewheel 
impacted the terrain.  The impact marks lay on a east southeast heading and the indentations 
in the earth indicated a near vertical descent.  There was a circumferential break in the fuselage

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
