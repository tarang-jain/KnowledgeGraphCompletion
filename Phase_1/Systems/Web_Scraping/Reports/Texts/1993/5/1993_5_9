Factual Information
 On May 1, 1993, at approximately 1845 central daylight time, during landing near Bentonville, 
Arkansas, a Raven S 55A, N6465K, was substantially damaged when it impacted a fence. The 
pilot and two passengers did not sustain injury. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for 
the business flight.
The pilot reported to the Fayetteville Flight Service Station that he had departed approximately 
one mile west of Rogers, Arkansas, for a local flight at approximately 1745. He further reported 
that the "wind picked up the balloon and dragged it into a barbed wire fence."  The flight 
service station reported the winds from the south at nine knots.
The pilot reported to the Safety Board that a "gust of wind hit the balloon blowing the envelope 
into a wire fence" while the balloon was being deflated.
The balloon was released to the owner following the investigation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
