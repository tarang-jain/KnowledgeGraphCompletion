Substantial

Injuries:
4 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Non-scheduled
Analysis 
THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE WAS USING ONLY THE LEFT SIDE OF THE GRAVEL 
RUNWAY FOR TAKEOFF BECAUSE IT '...WAS IN A LITTLE BETTER CONDITION' THAN 
THE RIGHT HALF OF THE RUNWAY WHICH WAS VERY WET AND SOFT FROM THE 
MELTING WINTER SNOW. DUE TO WET SPOTS ON THE LEFT SIDE, SOME OF THE LEFT 
EDGE CONE MARKERS HAD BEEN MOVED IN TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE 
RUNWAY, MAKING THE TAKEOFF AREA EVEN NARROWER. DURING LIFTOFF THE 
AIRPLANE WEATHERVANED DUE TO A CROSSWIND, AND THE LEFT HORIZONTAL 
STABILIZER & ELEVATOR COLLIDED WITH ONE OF THE 3-FT HIGH RUNWAY EDGE 
RUBBER CONE MARKERS. THE RUNWAY HAD BEEN REOPENED 4/27 AFTER HAVING 
BEEN CLOSED FOR 10 DAYS BECAUSE OF THE MELTING SNOW. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S POOR JUDGEMENT IN ATTEMPTING A TAKEOFF FROM A NARROW, WET, 
SOFT GRAVEL RUNWAY WITH A CROSSWIND. THE RUNWAY CONDITIONS AND THE 
CROSSWIND WERE FACTORS IN THE ACCIDENT.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On May 1, 1993, at 1415 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Cessna 172 airplane, N6332D, 
operated by RobAir, of Bethel, Alaska, struck a runway edge cone marker during takeoff from 
the airport at Kasigluk, Alaska.  The commercial pilot and three passengers were not injured, 
and the airplane was substantially damaged.  The unscheduled domestic passenger flight, 
operating under 14 CFR Part 135, was destined for Bethel.  Visual meteorological conditions 
existed, and a VFR flight plan was filed.
During a telephone interview immediately after the accident, the pilot stated the following in 
part:  "The right half of the runway was very wet and soft from the melting winter snow, so I 
was taking off using the left side only, which was in a little better condition.  Because of some 
soft wet spots on the left side, some of the left edge cone markers had been moved in toward 
the center of the runway, making the takeoff area even narrower.  Just as the airplane was 
lifting off the runway, it weathervaned to the right because of the right gusty 10 to 15 knot 
crosswind.  This caused the left horizontal stabilizer and elevator to hit one of the 3 foot high 
runway edge rubber cone markers.  I looked back and could not see any significant damage to 
the airplane, and it seemed to fly stable.  Because of the poor condition of the Kasigluk 
Runway, I decided to continue the flight back to Bethel, which was only about a 13 minute 
flight.  Other considerations were that Bethel had a better runway, and emergency medical 
personnel if we should need them."
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Bethel is located 24 miles east of Kasigluk.  At 1353 on the day of the accident the Bethel 
weather was 5,000 feet scattered, 60 miles visibility, temperature 45 degrees Fahrenheit, 
dewpoint 38 degrees Fahrenheit, winds 320 degrees at 11 knots, and altimeter setting 29.56 
inches of mercury.
After being closed for 10 days because of the melting snow, the Kasigluk runway was reopened 
on April 27, 1993, as reported by FAA Bethel NOTAM Number 04/017.
Shortly after the accident the pilot reported that the airplane sustained only minor damage to 
it's left elevator and horizontal stabilizer.  Several days later the damaged components were 
examined by FAA Inspector Walter G. Zackowitz, FSDO-03, Anchorage, Alaska.  He reported 
the damage to be substantial by NTSB criteria.
Shortly after the accident the operator ceased operation and surrendered his Part 135 Air Taxi 
Certificate to the FAA.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
