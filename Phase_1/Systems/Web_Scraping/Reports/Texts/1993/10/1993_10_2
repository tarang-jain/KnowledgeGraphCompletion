Factual Information
 On October 1, 1993, at 0900 mountain daylight time, a Bell 204-B helicopter, N41699, 
jettisoned an external load while maneuvering near Cedar Crest, New Mexico, resulting in 
serious injuries to a ground worker.  The helicopter was operating under visual meteorological 
conditions.  Idaho Helicopters was the operator.
The pilot reported, in his written report, and during an interview conducted by a Federal 
Aviation Administration inspector, that he was setting a pole between two existing telephone 
poles when he determined he could not put it in place.  He reported that he attempted to place 
the pole in the hole three times before he maneuvered to a designated release area so that he 
could jettison the load.
The pilot and other witnesses reported that a ground worker entered the designated release 
area to retrieve a tool after the load was jettisoned.  Witnesses reported that when the 
telephone pole was jettisoned it struck the ground and bounced into the worker.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
