THE PILOT (PIC) REPORTED THAT HE & ANOTHER PILOT (PASSENGER) FLEW TO A 
FRESH WATER RESERVOIR.  HE SAID THAT EN ROUTE, THEY 'TOOK TURNS DOING 
WING OVERS AND TIGHT TURNS.'  HE SAID THEY DECIDED TO MAKE A 360 DEGREE 
TURN OVER THE WATER, THEN FLY BACK TO THE DEPARTURE AIRPORT.  THE PIC 
INDICATED THAT WHILE TURNING OVER GLASSY WATER, THE WATER, SUN, HAZE & 
COLOR OF THE BACKGROUND TERRAIN RESULTED IN AN OPTICAL ILLUSION.  HE 
SAID HE LOST REFERENCE TO THE HORIZON, AND THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH 
THE WATER ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THE TURN.  THE PILOT SURVIVED THE 
ACCIDENT.  HE EGRESSED FROM THE AIRPLANE AS IT WAS SINKING, BUT WAS 
UNABLE TO RESCUE THE OTHER OCCUPANT.  NO MECHANICAL PROBLEM WITH THE 
AIRPLANE WAS REPORTED. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN ALTITUDE, WHILE PERFORMING A LOW-
ALTITUDE MANEUVER (TURN) OVER WATER.  FACTORS RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT 
WERE: SUN GLARE, HAZE, GLASSY CONDITION OF THE WATER, AND THE LACK OF 
VISUAL CUES (VISUAL PERCEPTION) FOR THE PILOT TO JUDGE ALTITUDE AND KEEP 
REFERENCE TO THE HORIZON.

Factual Information
 On October 1, 1993, at 1015 Pacific daylight time, a Cessna 182H, N8397S, operated by the 
pilot, collided into the Clear Lake (fresh water) Reservoir and sank.  The accident site was in 
northern California about 35 nautical miles east-southeast of the Klamath Falls International 
Airport, Oregon.  The airplane was substantially damaged and the private pilot was not injured.  
The passenger, a retired airline captain, was fatally injured.  The flight originated from 
Klamath Falls at 0950.
The pilot reported that visual meteorological conditions prevailed during the personal flight, 
and he did not file a flight plan.  After taking off, he proceeded to fly in the direction of the 
Clear Lake Reservoir.
In the pilot's completed "Aircraft Accident Report," NTSB Form 6120.1, he wrote that while en 
route, "...we both took turns doing wing overs and tight turns."  Upon arriving over the lake, 
the pilot commenced a left turn.  The pilot explained the mishap in the following manner:  
"Half way across the island, we decided to make a 360-degree turn to the left over water, and 
then go home.  We were half through the turn when there was an optical illusion with no 
horizon and flew into the water...."
The National Transportation Safety Board interviewed the pilot on October 2, 1993.  The pilot 
reported that when the accident occurred he had been flying the airplane.  The pilot stated that 
during the last turn he had lost his reference, and then the airplane contacted the water and 
sank.  No mechanical problems were experienced during the flight.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
