Analysis 
THE PILOT WAS FLYING HIS FLOAT EQUIPPED AIRPLANE ALONG THE NORTHERN 
SHORE OF LAKE MICHIGAN. HE OBSERVED LOWERING CEILINGS AND FOG OVER THE 
LAKE, AND GAVE A PILOT REPORT TO A FSS OF CLEAR AIR OVER LAND. HE 
CONTINUED TOWARDS HIS DESTINATION AND FLEW INTO THE DETERIORATING 
WEATHER. THE PASSENGER STATED THAT THE PILOT ELECTED TO MAKE A 
PRECAUTIONARY LANDING IN THE LAKE BECAUSE OF THE REDUCED VISIBILITY AND 
LOW CEILING. SHE SAID THE WATER WAS ROUGH AND THE AIRPLANE LANDED 
HARD, DUG IN THE RIGHT FLOAT AND NOSED OVER. WITH THE PILOT'S ASSISTANCE, 
SHE WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE THE CABIN OF THE AIRPLANE THROUGH THE PASSENGER 
WINDOW AND SWIM TO THE SURFACE. SHE WENT BACK TO HELP THE PILOT (HER 
HUSBAND) BUT HE WAS STUCK HALF-WAY OUT THE WINDOW AND SHE COULD NOT 
FREE HIM. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S IMPROPER FLARE FOR LANDING. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
ACCIDENT ARE THE LOW CLOUDS AND FOG, THE ROUGH WATER AT THE LANDING 
SITE, AND THE PILOT'S CONTINUED FLIGHT INTO KNOWN ADVERSE WEATHER.

Factual Information
 On August 1, 1993, about 1635 eastern daylight time, a float equipped Cessna 180 airplane, 
Canadian registration CFPTU, sustained substantial damage during a precautionary landing in 
Lake Michigan, approximately one-half mile off shore from Naubinway, Michigan.  The 
Canadian certificated pilot was fatally injured; his wife, the sole passenger, received minor 
injuries.  The flight operated under 14 CFR Part 91, and departed Shawano, Wisconsin, about 
1420 central daylight time.  A VFR flight plan was filed.
According to statements made by the passenger, they had encountered deteriorating weather 
conditions while flying over Lake Michigan. They were flying in patchy to occasionally heavy 
fog, and her husband continued to fly lower to escape the fog. She said, in part, "With 
visibilities reducing we decided to land on the water near the shoreline.  While landing the 
aircraft touched the water several times and then on the last touchdown it appeared to me that 
the right float dug into the water and then the aircraft cartwheeled... I am not sure of the height 
of the waves at the time except to say that when I surfaced the waves were washing over my 
head."
The passenger told a Michigan State Trooper who interviewed her on the day of the accident 
that the airplane came to rest upside down, suspended by its floats with the cabin submerged 
in water.  She said she released her safety belt, but could not get her cabin door open; her 
husband reached over and opened her window. With the window open, she was able to swim 
out of the airplane and grab onto a float.  She was able to look into the water and see her 
husband half out of the window.  He appeared to be caught on something in the cabin. She 
grabbed him but was unsuccessful in removing him.
The passenger was rescued by a canoeist approximately four hours after the accident.
Prior to his departure from Shawano, the pilot filed a VFR flight plan with the Green Bay, 
Wisconsin, flight service station, and requested the current and forecast weather for his 
destination (Sault St. Marie).  He was advised by the flight service station specialist that a 
thunderstorm was currently active at Sault St. Marie, and that visual meteorological conditions 
were forecast for the pilot's projected arrival time.
The pilot activated his VFR flight plan with the Green Bay flight service station at 1526, and 
reported to Green Bay at 1546:       "would like to revise my en route altitude to three thousand 
five hundred feet, and I will stay very close inland 'cause there's storm activities in some 
sections of the lake...the inland is very clear in case other pilots inquire about the weather."
During the investigation, it was learned from the Canadian Transportation Safety Board that 
the airplane's front seat occupant's seat belt restraint system had been modified with an after 
market shoulder harness.  A portion of the pilot's shoulder harness and lap belt was recovered 
from the airplane by the Macinac County Sheriff's office and sent to the NTSB.  The lap 
belt/shoulder harness  portion received was an incomplete length of lap belt webbing with the 
male half of the metal latching mechanism, and a portion of the shoulder harness webbing with 
a "V" shaped clip fastened at the end.  The "V" clip was secured to the male seat belt latch via a 
raised button.  The "V" clip was readily removed from the raised button with minimal force.  
No manufacturer's name was on any portion of the passenger restraint system received by the 
NTSB.  Two different serial numbers were found on the latching plate, 500950-405, and 
500950.

A conversation with the Macinac County Sheriff disclosed that the diver who had recovered the 
airplane found the seat belt portion of the restraint system unlatched, with the shoulder 
harness "V" clip still attached to the male latching mechanism.  The diver reportedly told the 
sheriff that the male and female portions of the seat belt latching mechanism mated and 
demated without difficulty.
An autopsy was performed by Doctors Carl Hawkins and Stephen D. Cohle, Blodgett Medical 
Center, Grand rapids, Michigan.  The cause of death is listed as "Asphyxia by drowning."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
