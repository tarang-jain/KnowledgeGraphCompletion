Factual Information
 On Thursday, September 2, 1993, at 0820 eastern daylight time, N56975, a Piper PA-28-140, 
owned and operated by Arthur Chuck of Beaver Creek, Ohio, collided with the ground during 
an aborted takeoff on runway 27 at Andy Barnhart Airport, New Carlisle, Ohio.  Instrument 
meteorological conditions prevailed and an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight plan had been 
filed.  The certificated private pilot and his passenger were not injured.  The personal flight was 
conducted under 14 CFR 91, and the intended destination was St Charles, Missouri.
According to the pilot, he had completed his preflight inspection and run-up successfully.  He 
stated that during the ground run,  "the aircraft rotated then settled back on the runway.  The 
takeoff was aborted and the aircraft exited the end of the runway."
According to the FAA, the pilot was taking off on runway 27 that is 2000 feet long.  The pilot 
reported to the FAA that he did not have enough airspeed, so he aborted the takeoff.  The 
airplane touched down 2/3 down the runway, veered to the left, and collided with the runway 
lights.  The pilot stated that this was his first takeoff at this airport with a passenger, and he did 
not use any flaps.  The pilot reported that there was no mechanical malfunction and the 
accident could have been prevented if the runway was longer, and a shortfield takeoff was 
executed.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
