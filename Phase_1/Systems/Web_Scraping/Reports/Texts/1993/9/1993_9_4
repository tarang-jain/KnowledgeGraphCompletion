1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
AS THE PILOT WAS FLARING TO LAND, THE ROTOR CONTROL ARM (CONTROL STICK) 
FAILED AT A LOCATION JUST ABOVE THE PILOT'S HEAD.  THE GYROCOPTER THEN 
ROLLED OVER AND CRASHED.  A METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION REVEALED THE 
CONTROL ARM HAD FAILED FROM FATIGUE.  THE FATIGUE ORIGINATED WHERE 
THE CONTROL ARM HAD BEEN CHAFED BY A LOOSE CLAMP. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
FATIGUE FAILURE OF THE GYROCOPTER'S MAIN ROTOR CONTROL ARM.  fACTORS 
RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: A LOOSE CLAMP ON THE ROTOR CONTROL ARM, 
DUE TO INADEQUATE MAINTENANCE OR INSPECTION, WHICH RESULTED IN 
CHAFING OF THE CONTROL ARM.

Factual Information
 On Thursday, September 2, 1993, at about 0830 EDT, a Lach Bensen B-8M, N8447, owned 
and operated by Walter Lach of Fall River, Massachusetts, rolled over and crashed during a 
landing at the Fall River Municipal Airport.  The gyrocopter was substantially damaged.  The 
pilot, who was the sole occupant, was seriously injured.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.  The flight was conducted in accordance with 14 
CFR 91.  
The pilot reported that as he was flaring to land, the rotor control arm (control stick) failed.  
The gyrocopter then went out of control, the engine RPM began increasing, and the gyrocopter 
roller over and crashed.  A post-accident examination of the gyrocopter revealed the control 
arm had failed in an area above the pilot's head.  The fracture was 90 degrees to the 
longitudinal axis of the control arm.  
An examination of the rotor control arm revealed that it had been manufactured from 
unalloyed aluminum tubing.  The tubing was about one inch in diameter with a wall thickness 
of about 1/16 inch.  Hardness of the tubing averaged 84.2 HRF, which was consistent with 
unalloyed aluminum.  
Metallurgical examination of the rotor control arm revealed that it had failed from fatigue.  
Fatigue had originated in two areas on the outer diameter of the control arm, where it had been 
chafed by a loose clamp.  Fatigue had progressed through the wall thickness of the control arm, 
then it continued circumferentially in both directions.  The fatigue crack had progress about 
half way around the tube before final overstress failure occurred.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
