Factual Information
 On September 1, 1993, at 1500 Alaska daylight time, the pilot of a wheel equipped Luscombe 
8A airplane, N71585, lost control of the airplane and crashed while maneuvering in a mountain 
valley near the Kijik River, approximately 30 miles northeast of Port Alsworth, Alaska.  The 
commercial pilot, the sole occupant, received serious injuries, and the airplane was 
substantially damaged.  The personal flight, operating under 14 CFR Part 91, departed Port 
Alsworth at about 1415, with a destination of the Stony River Lodge.  Visual meteorological 
conditions existed, and no flight plan was filed.
During a telephone interview on September 3, 1993, the pilot stated the following, in part:  "I 
was trying to follow the map and fly through the mountains.  I was not familiar with the area 
and had never flown that route before.  I had flown through one little pass, then realized that I 
had gone the wrong way and was too far east.  I saw a valley heading to the west so I decided to 
fly that way.  I could see a saddle at the end and over into another valley.  I had added power, 
but realized that the airplane wasn't going to climb high enough in time to get over the saddle, 
so I decided to turn around and get out. During the turn I didn't notice that the airspeed had 
got so slow.  The airplane suddenly stalled and went into a spin.  I might have got into a 
downdraft.  I was pretty close to the ground, but managed to pull the nose up and get out of the 
spin and into a pretty level attitude.  The airplane pancaked in right at the bottom of the pull 
up and the fuselage broke in half."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
