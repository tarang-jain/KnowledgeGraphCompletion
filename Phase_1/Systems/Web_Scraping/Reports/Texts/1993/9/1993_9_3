Analysis 
THE PILOT SAID WHILE ATTEMPTING TO TAKEOFF FROM A MOUNTAIN RIDGE, THE 
LEFT MAIN WHEEL ENTERED A DEPRESSION AND HE HAD TO USE HARDER THAN 
NORMAL CONTROL FORCES TO KEEP THE AIRPLANE ALIGNED WITH THE TAKEOFF 
PATH.  WHEN THE AIRPLANE CAME OUT OF THE DEPRESSION, IT BOUNCED INTO 
THE AIR AND BECAUSE OF THE LEFT QUARTERING HEADWIND, IT CAME BACK DOWN 
ON THE RIGHT MAIN WHEEL AND THE RIGHT WING.  THE AIRPLANE THEN SPUN 
AROUND CLOCKWISE ABOUT 180 DEGREES AND HIT ON THE NOSE, THEN THE LEFT 
WING.  BOTH MAIN LANDING GEAR BOXES WERE TORN OUT OF THE FUSELAGE, 
WHICH WAS ALSO DAMAGED. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE. A FACTOR WAS 
THE  CROSSWIND. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - IN FLIGHT
Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF
Findings
1. (C) AIRCRAFT CONTROL - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND
2. (F) WEATHER CONDITION - CROSSWIND

Factual Information
 On September 2, 1993, at 2230 Alaska daylight time, the pilot of a wheel equipped Cessna 170 
airplane, N2384D, lost control and dragged a wing while attempting to takeoff from a 
mountain ridge near the Wulik River, approximately 80 miles northwest of Kotzebue, Alaska.  
The airline transport pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured, and the airplane was 
substantially damaged.  The personal flight, operating under 14 CFR Part 91, was destined for 
another remote landing area located about 1 mile away from the accident site.  Visual 
meteorological conditions existed, and a VFR flight plan was filed.
When the pilot was contacted by telephone on September 7, 1993, he stated the following, in 
part:  "During the takeoff roll, the left main wheel got into a depression and I had to use harder 
than normal control forces to keep the airplane aligned with the takeoff path.  When the 
airplane came out of the depression, it bounced into the air and because of the left quartering 
headwind, it came back down on the right main wheel and the right wing.  The airplane then 
spun around clockwise about 180 degrees and hit on the nose, then the left wing.  Both main 
landing gear boxes were torn out of the fuselage, which was also damaged."
The pilot's statement on the accident report (NTSB Form 6120.1/2) varies considerably from 
his telephone statement on September 7, 1993.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
