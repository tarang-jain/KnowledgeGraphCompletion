Location:
MARIETTA, GA
Accident Number:
ATL93MA055
Date & Time:
02/03/1993, 1327 EST 
Registration:
N130X
Aircraft:
LOCKHEED L382E-44K-20
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
7 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation -
Analysis 
THE ACFT WAS DESIGNED & USED AS THE COMPANY'S ENGINEERING TEST BED. AN 
EVALUATION OF THE FLY-BY-WIRE RUDDER ACTUATOR & GROUND MINIMUM 
CONTROL SPEED (VMCG) WAS BEING CONDUCTED. DURING THE FINAL HI-SPEED 
GROUND TEST RUN, THE ACFT ABRUPTLY VEERED LEFT & BECAME AIRBORNE. IT 
ENTERED A LEFT TURN, CLIMBED TO ABOUT 250 FT, DEPARTED CONTROLLED FLT & 
IMPACTED THE GRND. INVESTIGATION REVEALED A DESIGN FEATURE IN THE 
RUDDER ACTUATOR THAT REMOVES HYD PRESSURE WITHIN THE ACTUATOR IF THE 
RUDDER POSITION COMMANDED BY THE PILOT EXCEEDED THE ACTUAL RUDDER 
ACTUATOR POSITION FOR A SPECIFIED TIME, AND THE RUDDER AERODYNAMICALLY 
TRAILS. THE ACTUATOR PREVIOUSLY DISENGAGED IN FLT. THE COMPANY DID NOT 
CONDUCT A SYSTEM SAFETY REVIEW OF THE RUDDER BYPASS FEATURE & ITS 
CONSEQUENCES TO ALL FLT REGIMES, NOR OF THE VMCG TEST. THE FLT TEST PLAN 
SPECIFIED THAT ENGINE POWER BE RETARDED IF THE RUDDER BECAME 
INEFFECTIVE. NEITHER PLT HAD RECEIVED TRAINING AS AN EXPERIMENTAL TEST 
PLT. THE COMPANY ALLOWED EXPERIMENTAL FLT TESTS AT A CONFINED, 
METROPOLITAN ARPT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
DISENGAGEMENT OF THE RUDDER FLY-BY-WIRE FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM 
RESULTING IN A TOTAL LOSS OF RUDDER CONTROL CAPABILITY WHILE 
CONDUCTING GROUND MINIMUM CONTROL SPEED TESTS. THE DISENGAGEMENT 
WAS A RESULT OF THE INADEQUATE DESIGN OF THE RUDDER'S INTEGRATED 
ACTUATOR PACKAGE BY ITS MANUFACTURER; THE OPERATOR'S INSUFFICIENT 
SYSTEM SAFETY REVIEW FAILED TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE 
INADEQUATE DESIGN TO ALL OPERATING REGIMES. A FACTOR WHICH 
CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE FLIGHT CREW'S LACK OF ENGINEERING 
FLIGHT TEST TRAINING.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
