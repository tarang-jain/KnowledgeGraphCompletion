Factual Information
 On November 1, 1993, approximately 1225 Pacific standard time (PST), a Cessna 172H, 
N6629H, impacted trees during an attempted go-around at McKenzie Bridge State Airport, 
McKenzie Bridge, Oregon. The private pilot was not injured, but his passenger received minor 
injuries, and the aircraft sustained substantial damage. The personal pleasure flight, which 
departed Hobby Field, Creswell, Oregon, about 30 minutes earlier, was being operated in 
visual meteorological conditions at the time of the accident. There was no flight plan filed for 
this flight, and the ELT, which was activated by the impact, was turned off at the scene.
The pilot said that he accidently came in high to the 2,600 foot long remote airstrip. Near the 
approach end of the runway he initiated a go-around, and repositioned the flaps from their 
full-down position to the 20 degree position. The pilot said that he applied full throttle, but he 
felt that the aircraft was not developing full power. He estimated that the aircraft was only able 
to gain about 20 feet prior to reaching the departure end of the runway. The aircraft collided 
with trees just off the end of the runway, and then impacted the ground.
An FAA Airworthiness Inspector who examined the engine after the accident was unable to 
find any reason for the reported power loss.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
