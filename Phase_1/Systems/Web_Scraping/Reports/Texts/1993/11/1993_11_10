Factual Information
 On November 3, 1993, at 1446 mountain standard time, a Bellanca BL17-31ATC, N9516E, was 
substantially damaged when the right main landing gear collapsed after the airplane departed 
the side of the runway at Stevens Field, Pagosa Springs, Colorado.  The pilot and his passenger 
were not injured and the aircraft sustained substantial damage.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for this personal flight which departed from 
Plainview, Texas, at 1246 central standard time.
According to the pilot, the left brake locked during the landing roll and the aircraft went off the 
left side of the runway.  The pilot said that during this excursion, the right main landing gear 
collapsed and the nose gear was distorted.  The airframe sustained damage around the right 
main gear mount.
Examination of the aircraft by an Federal Aviation Administration inspector provided no 
evidence of a brake system malfunction.  Examination of the runway provided witness marks of 
skidding of both main tires and scrubbing of the nose tire in a curve to the left.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
