Factual Information
 On July 1, 1993, at approximately 2015 central daylight time, a Cessna 172D,  N2446U, was 
substantially damaged upon impact with trees and the ground following a loss of engine power 
while in cruise flight near Lampasas, Texas. The private pilot and his passenger sustained 
minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight.
According to the pilot, he decided to take the airplane for a short flight in the local area 
knowing that he had not refueled since his last two flight totalling approximately three hours. 
The pilot added that about five minutes into the flight, a partial loss of engine power was 
experienced and he proceeded to bank the airplane to the left to head towards an open field, 
when the engine lost all power. He further stated that due to the strong surface winds he 
elected to turn the airplane into the wind to execute the forced landing. The airplane landed in 
a small field and ran into trees.
The pilot stated that his preflight of the fuel system was limited to checking the fuel level on the 
airplane's fuel gauges. Post accident examination of the fuel cells by the pilot revealed that fuel 
in either fuel cell was between half a gallon, to a gallon of fuel.
Damage to the airplane included a damaged right wing spar, a collapsed nose wheel, a buckled 
engine firewall, and a destroyed right wing aileron.
The airplane was released to the owner at the accident site.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
