Location:
WASILLA, AK
Accident Number:
ANC93FA107
Date & Time:
07/01/1993, 1315 AKD 
Registration:
N93018
Aircraft:
CESSNA 185
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
 THE PILOT IN COMMAND SAID THAT HE BELIEVED THAT HE COMMENCED THE 
WATER TAKEOFF FROM THE GENERAL AREA ON THE LAKE THAT HE NORMALLY DID 
AND THAT THE TAKEOFF RUN, USING TWO NOTCHES OF FLAP, AND THE LIFT OFF 
POINT WERE ROUTINE.  NOT ALL OF THE AVAILABLE LAKE AREA WAS USED FOR THE 
TAKEOFF. THE PLANE CARRIED APPROXIMATELY 75 GALLONS OF FUEL, THE PILOT 
AND A PASSENGER, EACH WEIGHING UNDER 175 POUNDS, A FISHING TACKLE BOX 
AND A SMALL SURVIVAL BAG.  AS THE PLANE CLIMBED TO THE HEIGHT OF THE 
TREES AT THE RAPIDLY APPROACHING SHORELINE, HE ENCOUNTERED A GUST OF 
WIND WHICH REQUIRED A MOMENTARY FLIGHT CONTROL INPUT TO COUNTER.  HE 
DID NOT EXPERIENCE THE SENSATION THAT THE PLANE HAD ENCOUNTERED A 
DOWNDRAFT. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, HE REALIZED THAT HE DID NOT HAVE 
SUFFICIENT ALTITUDE TO CLEAR THE TREES. THE PILOT'S LOG BOOK SHOWED THAT 
PRIOR TO JULY 1993, HIS LAST FLIGHT IN N93018 OCCURRED IN JUNE 1992.  THE 
PILOT REPORTED THAT HE DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY DIFFICULTIES WITH THE 
PLANE'S ENGINE OR FLIGHT CONTROLS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT IN COMMAND'S FAILURE TO USE ALL OF THE AVAILABLE RUNWAY 
(WATERWAY).  A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT IN COMMAND'S LACK OF 
RECENT EXPERIENCE IN THE TYPE OF OPERATION.

Factual Information
 On July 1, 1993, at approximately 1315 Alaska daylight time, a float equipped Cessna 185 
airplane, N93018, registered to and operated by the pilot in command, crashed during takeoff 
from the Anderson Lake Seaplane Strip in Wasilla, Alaska.  The airline transport certificated 
pilot and the one passenger on board received minor injuries, and the airplane sustained 
substantial damage.  The local pleasure flight was being conducted under 14 CFR Part 91 and a 
VFR flight plan had not been filed.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The pilot in command told the NTSB investigator during the on scene investigation that prior 
to commencing the takeoff, he performed a preflight and engine run up check and found 
everything to be in proper working order.  The airplane's wing fuel tanks were full and the 
cargo/baggage consisted of a fishing tackle box and a small bag containing survival gear.  The 
on scene investigation verified this information.  The pilot said that the takeoff was 
commenced from the other side of the lake in the general area that he normally began his 
takeoffs from.  Not all of the available lake area was used for the takeoff run.  The plane's 
takeoff acceleration and engine instrument indications were normal.  The pilot said that he 
believed that the airplane became airborne in the approximate area that it normally did.  The 
pilot did not recall the airspeed at which the airplane became airborne nor the speed at which 
the plane was flown during the initial climb out.  The pilot said that as the airplane climbed to 
the height of the trees at the rapidly approaching shoreline, a gust of wind from the right was 
encountered which required some pilot input to correct.  The pilot said that this was the only 
wind induced event that was experienced during the flight and that he did not experience the 
sensation that the plane was sinking or that it had entered a downdraft.  The pilot said that 
upon correcting for the gust, he realized that he did not have sufficient altitude to avoid 
colliding with the trees.  He then slightly reduced engine power and maneuvered the plane 
away from a nearby house.  
The pilot reported that he did not experience any problems with the plane's engine or flight 
controls.  The on scene investigation collaborated the comments made by the pilot.
Based upon the empty weight of the airplane, and the known fuel, cargo and weights of the 
pilot and passenger, the airplane's weight and center of gravity (CG) at the time the takeoff was 
commenced was approximately 3000 pounds and 42 inches, respectively.  The forward and aft 
CG limits at 3000 pounds are 40 inches and 46.5 inches, respectively.  The plane's maximum 
authorized weight is 3350 pounds.     
The pilots log book showed that prior to July 1993, his most recent flight in N93018 occurred 
in June 1992.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
