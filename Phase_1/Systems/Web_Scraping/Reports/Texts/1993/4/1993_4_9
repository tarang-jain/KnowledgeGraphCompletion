Analysis 
 THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE WAS PERFORMING A NORMAL LANDING; THE TAIL 
WHEEL TOUCHED DOWN FIRST, THEN THE MAINS. DURING THE LANDING ROLL, 
DIRECTIONAL CONTROL WAS LOST, AND THE AIRCRAFT GROUND LOOPED. THE 
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE TAIL WHEEL LEAF SPRINGS HAD FAILED. 
THERE WAS CORROSION ON ONE OF THE FRACTURE SURFACES; HOWEVER, 
METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE SPRINGS REVEALED THAT ALL FRACTURES 
WERE FROM OVERLOAD. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT ALL OF THE LEAF SPRINGS 
WERE NOT LOCATED; THEREFORE, A COMPLETE METALLURGICAL STUDY WAS NOT 
POSSIBLE. THE AIRCRAFT TOTAL TIME WAS 26 HOURS; HOWEVER, THE LEAF 
SPRINGS WERE INSTALLED IN A USED CONDITION, AND THE MAINTENANCE 
HISTORY OF THE SPRINGS WAS NOT AVAILABLE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE OVERLOAD FAILURE OF THE TAIL WHEEL LEAF SPRINGS, WHICH RESULTED IN 
A LOSS OF DIRECTIONAL CONTROL DURING THE LANDING ROLL.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
