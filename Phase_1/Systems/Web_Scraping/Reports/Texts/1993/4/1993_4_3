Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On April 1, 1993, at approximately 1615 mountain standard time, an Aerospatiale SA316B, 
N3153R, impacted terrain at 12,000 feet MSL in the Willow Creek Wilderness Area, 
approximately 15 miles south southwest of Aspen, Colorado.  The pilot and two passengers 
received fatal injuries and one passenger received serious injuries.  The helicopter was 
destroyed.  The flight was being conducted under 14 CFR Part 135 to transport persons from a 
lodge in the vicinity of Crested Butte, Colorado, to Aspen when the accident occurred.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed.
The helicopter was reported missing on the evening of April 1.  On the morning of April 2nd, 
the survivor walked out to a ranch approximately 11 miles from the accident site.  On April 4, 
the bodies of the fatally injured were recovered.
Examination and recovery of the wreckage was delayed due to heavy snow cover at the accident 
site.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
According to available information, the pilot was an experienced mountain pilot, had flown in 
the accident site region on many previous flights.  A review of FAA records did not indicate any 
abnormal operational history.  Details of the pilot's flight experience may be found on page 3 of 
this document.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
Accident site weather was reported by the survivor who was not aviation oriented, but was an 
experienced back country ski instructor.  His observations are recorded on pages 3 and 4 of this 
document.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
According to information provided by the survivor, the flight had been airborne approximately 
20 minutes and had just passed through a gap known as Schofield Pass.  He further reported 
that the flight was proceeding down a canyon at 150 to 200 feet above ground level when he 
heard a sound like something under tension broke.  This was accompanied by negative 'g' 
forces and a change in engine noise.  The helicopter then descended into 50 to 60 foot high 
pine trees in a shallow right turn.  According to the survivor, there was no communication from 
the pilot during this time.
The main rotor, main gear box, engine, and aft portion of the tail boom, and the tail rotor 
assembly were found separated from the helicopter.  The helicopter collided with other trees 
and the cabin top and nose section also separated.  The helicopter came to rest upright facing 
opposite the direction of travel.
According to the survivor, the pilot remained in his seat, the person occupying the left front 
seat was thrown clear of the helicopter, the person in the left rear seat remained in the 
helicopter, and he remained in the helicopter.  Trained in emergency first aid, the survivor 
checked for vital signs in the other three occupants after extricating himself.  No vital signs 
were found.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION

An autopsy was performed at the Valley View Hospital in Glenwood Springs, Colorado.  
Toxicological test results are enclosed and were negative.
TESTS AND RESEARCH  
Following examination of the helicopter in the field, and more detailed examination after the 
aircraft was removed to storage, the following parts were removed for examination by the 
National Transportation Safety Board Materials Laboratory:
          1.  Flight control lower mixing unit,
          2.  Flight control upper mixing unit, and 
          3.  Fore and aft servo.
Examination of the above components revealed a fatigue fracture in the lower mixing unit and 
fatigue cracking in the upper mixing unit.  Details of the examinations are contained in the 
attached Metallurgists' Factual Report.
A review of aircraft records revealed that the mixing units had been inspected when the 
helicopter was acquired by the operator approximately 200 flight hours prior to the accident 
flight.
ADDITIONAL DATA
The wreckage was released to Mr. Dennis Jason of Jason and Associates on December 15, 1993.

NTSB accident and incident dockets serve as permanent archival information for the NTSB™s 
investigations. Dockets released prior to June 1, 2009 are publicly available from the NTSB™s

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
