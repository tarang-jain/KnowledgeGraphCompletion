Aviation Accident Preliminary Report
Location:
Ramona, CA
Accident Number:
ANC18LA043
Date & Time:
06/01/2018, 1118 PDT 
Registration:
N9410M
Aircraft:
CESSNA 210
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On June 1, 2018, about 1118 Pacific daylight time, a retractable landing gear-equipped Cessna 
210 airplane, N9410M, sustained substantial damage after a main landing gear collapsed 
during a landing at Ramona Airport (RNM), Ramona, California. The private pilot and 
passenger were uninjured. The airplane was registered to a private individual and operated by 
the pilot under the provisions of 14
 Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 91 as a visual flight rules 
personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. The 
flight departed Alexander Municipal Airport (E80), Belen, New Mexico, about 0830 mountain 
daylight time.
During an interview with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-
charge, the pilot stated that while approaching RNM, he selected the landing gear handle to the 
down position; however, the green gear down light did not illuminate and the main landing 
gear did not lock in the down position. He then selected the landing gear handle up and the 
landing gear did not retract. He maneuvered to the north of the airport and attempted to 
manually pump the landing gear down with the emergency hand pump. The pilot stated that 
the handle was very difficult to move and after several pumps it would not move at all. He 
utilized an airframe mounted mirror to visually check that the left landing gear was in the 
down position, and then conducted a visual approach and landing to runway 27.
During the landing, the right main landing gear collapsed and the airplane veered to the right 
and departed the runway surface, coming to rest on the parallel taxiway. During the accident 
sequence, the right wing and horizontal stabilizer impacted the ground, resulting in substantial 
damage to the right horizontal stabilizer and elevator. 
The airplane was removed from the runway and secured for further investigation.
