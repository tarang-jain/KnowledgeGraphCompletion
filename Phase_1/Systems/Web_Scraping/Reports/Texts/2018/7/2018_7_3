Location:
Mackinac Island, MI
Accident Number:
GAA18CA407
Date & Time:
07/01/2018, 1200 EDT 
Registration:
N66568
Aircraft:
Beech 58
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Runway excursion
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
The pilot of the twin-engine airplane reported that during the takeoff roll on the 3,500-foot 
runway the airplane's airspeed indicator did not indicate an airspeed, so he rejected the 
takeoff. He added that, he attempted to brake, but "full braking [was] not initially possible due 
to lift". Subsequently, the airplane overran the runway onto a downhill grass area and struck a 
wood fence. 
During a post-accident inspection the pilot discovered that the pitot tube cover had not been 
removed before the flight.
According to the manufacturer, the typical takeoff roll is approximately 1,336 feet and the 
approximate landing roll is 1,440 feet.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot added that his preflight memory list was: fuel, oil, tires, props, and surfaces. He will 
now add, "chocks, cowl plugs, pitot tube covers".
