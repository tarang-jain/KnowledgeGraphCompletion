Analysis   
The pilot reported that, after departure in dark night conditions, he became disoriented about 
two-thirds of the way to his destination airport. He added that he circled over a nearby town 
for about an hour but was unable to find any visual references to aid in navigation. The pilot 
then called a family member on the ground, who provided guidance to the destination airport 
via a phone tracking application. He added that he spotted what appeared to be the destination 
airport, maneuvered for approach, and during the landing flare, he realized he was not at the 
airport. The pilot landed on a roadway that was about 6 miles from his intended destination. 
During landing, the airplane struck trees, landed on a road, veered left, and impacted a light 
pole.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and left wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's geographic disoriention during a night flight, which resulted in an off-airport 
landing.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=96556
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
