Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On May 2, 2018, about 1100 central daylight time, an experimental homebuilt Hartline Kitfox 
III, N73BH, registered to a private individual, sustained substantial damage during a forced 
landing immediately after takeoff from the Stovall Ranch Nr 4 Airport (6TX9), marathon, 
Texas. The airline transport rated pilot and 1 passenger sustained minor injuries. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed. The personal local flight 
was being conducted under the provisions of Federal Code of Regulations Part 91.
The pilot reported that during takeoff, about 15-feet above the ground, the airplane rolled 
violently to the right. He applied full aileron and rudder opposite the roll, but the airplane 
continued to roll to the right. The airplane struck the ground with the right wing and then 
impacted a mesquite tree. 
After the accident, it was discovered that 3 of the 4 hinges connecting the right flaperon hangar 
rib had come loose. The wooden (spruce) material of the flaperon appeared to by dry rotted 
where the hinges connected. According to records provided by the owner, the airplane had last 
flown about 6 months prior to the accident flight. Records showed that the airplane had about 
3 hours of flight time since its most recent conditional inspection which was performed on may 
23, 2017.
Denny Aerocraft Company Service Bulletin #9, dated September 12, 1991, had identified 
flaperon hangar rib failures on Kitfox models I, II, and III. The service bulletin identified the 
area of the attachment to be reinforced with a metal fixture. The accident airplane did not have 
the fixture installed.
