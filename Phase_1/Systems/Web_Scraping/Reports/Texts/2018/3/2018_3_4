Location:
Vero Beach, FL
Accident Number:
GAA18CA204
Date & Time:
03/02/2018, 1230 EST 
Registration:
N158ND
Aircraft:
PIPER PA28
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The solo student pilot reported that, during approach, he was above the glideslope after adding 
full flaps, so he lowered the nose to lose altitude. He added that he "brought a little more speed 
than intended" into ground effect and the airplane yawed to the left. He overcorrected to the 
right. The airplane touched down to the right of the runway centerline with the nose pointed 
45° to the left. The student attempted to maintain directional control, but the airplane exited 
the runway to the right and the right wing struck a runway sign. The student pilot taxied back 
onto the runway and to the parking ramp without further incident.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The chief flight instructor of the flight school reported that there were no preaccident 
mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal 
operation.
The automated weather observation station located on the airport reported that, about 37 
minutes before the accident, the wind was from 360° at 6 knots. The same automated station 
reported that, about 23 minutes after the accident, the wind was from 030° at 11 knots, gusting 
to 17 knots. The airplane landed on runway 04.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain a stabilized approach, which resulted in overcorrection 
with the rudder during the landing, loss of control, and a runway excursion.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
