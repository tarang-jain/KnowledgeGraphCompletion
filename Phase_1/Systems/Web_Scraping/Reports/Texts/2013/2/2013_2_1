Analysis   
The private pilot was attempting a soft field takeoff on a paved runway. He advanced the 
throttle to the full forward position and applied full back pressure on the flight controls to 
begin the takeoff roll. However, the airplane veered to the left. The pilot tried to counteract the 
veer by applying right rudder and when that was unsuccessful, elected to reject the takeoff. The 
airplane™s horizontal stabilizer was substantially damaged when the airplane exited the runway 
and struck a frangible airport sign. Postaccident examination revealed no mechanical 
malfunctions or anomalies with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s failure to maintain control of the airplane during the takeoff roll.
Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
