Analysis   
After performing three touch-and-go landings on a frozen lake, the pilot set up for a full stop 
landing on the plowed surface of the frozen lake. After a smooth landing, and while taxiing to 
park, the left wheel strut collapsed. The airplane tipped over onto its left side, resulting in 
substantial damage to the left wing spar. Examination of the airplane after the accident 
revealed evidence of fatigue cracking on the failed portion of the left wheel strut mount. The 
airplane had been flown about 50-75 hours after its last annual inspection with no problems 
noted by the owner. The pilot stated that he lands on frozen lakes frequently and that the 
collapse of the landing gear was unexpected.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Fatigue cracking and failure of the left wheel strut mount resulting in collapse of the left main 
landing gear during taxi.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
