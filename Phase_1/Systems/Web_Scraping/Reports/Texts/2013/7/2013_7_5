Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Ipswich, SD
Accident Number:
CEN13LA391
Date & Time:
07/02/2013, 1530 CDT 
Registration:
N2072D
Aircraft:
AIR TRACTOR AT-402B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
At the beginning of an aerial application run, the pilot rotated the airplane near the end of the 
runway; the airplane lifted up from the ground, yawed, and then shuddered. The airplane 
descended, the left wing contacted the ground, and the airplane slid to a stop. The 
circumstances of the accident are consistent with an aerodynamic stall during takeoff because 
the pilot failed to obtain adequate speed to climb the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s failure to obtain adequate airspeed during the takeoff roll, which resulted in an 
aerodynamic stall.
Findings
Aircraft
Airspeed - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)

Factual Information
On July 2, 2013, about 1530 central daylight time, an Air Tractor AT-402B, N2072D, impacted 
terrain after takeoff from a private strip near Ipswich, South Dakota. The commercial pilot was 
not injured. The airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane was registered to and 
operated by Tri County Ag Service Inc., under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 137 as an aerial application flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, 
which operated without a flight plan. The local flight was originating at the time of the 
accident.
In a telephone interview with the pilot, he reported that the airplane was loaded with 380 
gallons of applicant and 170 gallons of fuel prior to departure. He rotated the airplane near the 
end of the runway and the airplane lifted off. The airplane then twisted or yawed and he felt the 
airplane shudder before the left wing dropped and the airplane descended. The left wing 
contacted the ground and the airplane slid to a stop. Examination of the airplane revealed 
substantial damage to the left wing and fuselage.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
