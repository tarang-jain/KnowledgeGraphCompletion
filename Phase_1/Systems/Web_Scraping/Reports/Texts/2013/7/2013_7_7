Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Fort Smith, MT
Accident Number:
WPR13CA213
Date & Time:
07/02/2013, 1012 MDT 
Registration:
N302MX
Aircraft:
AVIAT A-1B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Collision during takeoff/land
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Aerial Observation
Analysis   
The pilot reported that he was conducting a wildlife survey flight and had been airborne about 
2.5 hours, when the observer said that he would like to take a break. At that time, the flight was 
over a high mesa covered in short grass, which the pilot decided was a suitable landing area. 
The touchdown was smooth, but the airplane encountered undulating terrain during the 
rollout and began to bounce. The pilot added full power to abort the landing, and the airplane's 
speed began to increase; however, the pilot was unable to take off before impacting a bush. The 
airplane traveled several hundred feet down a ravine and came to an abrupt stop. The 
airplane's main landing gear collapsed, and both wings sustained substantial damage. The pilot 
estimated that the density altitude at the landing site was about 8,950 feet. He stated that the 
accident could have been avoided had he "made the decision not to land off-airport in that area 
at such density altitudes." The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures 
with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper decision to land on rough terrain at a high density altitude.
Findings
Personnel issues
Decision making/judgment - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
High density altitude - Effect on equipment
Rough terrain - Awareness of condition

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=86791
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
