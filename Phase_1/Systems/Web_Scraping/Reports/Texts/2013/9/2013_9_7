Deer Valley, AZ
Accident Number:
WPR13CA397
Date & Time:
09/01/2013, 0937 MST 
Registration:
N2134M
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172S
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Runway excursion
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
During a practice touch-and-go landing, the student pilot did not properly maintain runway 
alignment during the landing flare. The flight instructor took control of the airplane as the 
wheels touched down on the runway, and attempted a go-around. However, during the go-
around, the flight instructor did not retract the flaps to 20 degrees, which the normal 
procedures require. Subsequently the airplane bounced, landed in an open area adjacent to the 
runway, and came to rest upright. During the accident sequence, the airplane sustained 
substantial damage to the wings and horizontal stabilizer. The flight instructor reported that 
there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's inadequate flare and the flight instructor's delayed remedial action and 
failure to maintain control of the airplane during a go-around. Contributing to the accident was 
the flight instructor's improper go-around procedures.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=87976
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
