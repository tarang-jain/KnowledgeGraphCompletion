Analysis   
The flight instructor and pilot receiving instruction were landing a tailwheel-equipped 
airplane. The instructor reported that that the after touchdown the airplane veered to the right. 
He took control of the airplane and applied full left rudder and left brake. The airplane tracked 
straight for a moment before it turned right and departed the runway. The left main landing 
gear collapsed and the left wing impacted the ground. Examination of the airplane's right brake 
rotor revealed heat damage (bluing) of the rotor and substantial damage to the airplane's wing 
and fuselage. The instructed noted that the other pilot did not appear to make any control 
inputs that would have resulted in a right turn.   
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A dragging right brake, which resulted in an un-commanded  right turn, and subsequent 
ground loop.

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=88432
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
