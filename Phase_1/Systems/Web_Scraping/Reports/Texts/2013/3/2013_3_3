Factual Information
On March 2, 2013, approximately 1045 eastern standard time, a Cessna 150G, N3438J, was 
substantially damaged during landing on Long Lake in Naples, Maine. The certificated student 
pilot was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed 
for the instructional flight, which departed Eastern Slopes Regional Airport (IZG), Fryeburg, 
Maine, and was destined for Limington-Harmon Airport (63B), Limington, Maine. The flight 
was operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.
The pilot reported in the NTSB Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report Form that he was 
practicing maneuvers at 2,500 feet before descending the airplane to 700 feet over the frozen 
lake. He applied engine power to climb the airplane back to a higher altitude, but when the 
engine ﬁwould not respond,ﬂ the pilot believed there was carburetor ice present, and conducted 
a forced landing to the lake.  During the landing roll, the airplane traveled about 150 feet in a 
12-inch-thick layer of snow and slush before the nose landing gear collapsed and bent aft, 
resulting in substantial damage to the engine firewall. The airplane came to rest approximately 
250 yards from the south shore of the lake.
A Federal Aviation Administration inspector responded to the accident scene, and spoke with 
the pilot immediately following the accident. The pilot stated to the inspector that he had 
intended to land on the lake in order to visit with a friend, and reported no mechanical 
anomalies with the airplane. He further stated that his certificated flight instructor had given 
him an endorsement for the flight between IZG and 63B, but had not provided an endorsement 
for landing on the lake.
The pilot held a student pilot certificate and reported 45 total hours of flight experience, of 
which 26 hours were in the accident airplane make and model.
The 1054 weather observation at IZG, located approximately 13 miles southwest of the accident 
site, included winds from 10 degrees at 10 knots, 10 miles visibility, broken clouds at 3,700 
feet, temperature 4 degrees C, dew point 4 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 29.62 inches 
of mercury.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
