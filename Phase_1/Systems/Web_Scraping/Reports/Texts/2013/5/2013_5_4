Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Saint Louis, MO
Accident Number:
CEN13LA252
Date & Time:
05/01/2013, 0745 CDT 
Registration:
N731NR
Aircraft:
CESSNA P210N
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Landing gear not configured
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
While on left base of the traffic pattern, an air traffic controller instructed the pilot to make a 
"short approach" to avoid traffic. The pilot reported that he lowered the landing gear handle 
but that he was unsure if the landing gear down indicator light had illuminated, and he did not 
remember visually verifying that the gear was down during the approach. The pilot stated that, 
during the approach, he was distracted by an odd smell in the cockpit, which he thought may 
have been the air conditioner malfunctioning. The airplane touched down on the runway 
surface with the landing gear retracted. Examination of the landing gear system revealed no 
evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. 
Therefore, it is likely that the pilot was distracted by the odor in the cockpit and did not lower 
the landing gear or check that it was in the down position before landing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to extend the landing gear or check that it was in the down position before 
landing.
Findings
Personnel issues
Forgotten action/omission - Pilot (Cause)
Use of checklist - Pilot (Cause)

Factual Information
On May 1, 2013, about 0745 central daylight, a Cessna P210N airplane, N731NR, was 
substantially damaged during a gear up landing at Spirit of St. Louis Airport (SUS), St. Louis, 
Missouri. The pilot did not report any injuries. The airplane was registered to and operated by 
the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. 
Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated without a flight 
plan. The flight originated from St. Charles County Smartt Airport (SET), St. Charles, Missouri 
about 0700. 
While on left base of the traffic pattern at SUS, the pilot was instructed by air traffic control to 
make a short approach for traffic avoidance. The pilot stated that he lowered the landing gear 
handle, but was unsure if the landing gear down indicator light had illuminated. He normally 
checked the landing gear visually, but did not remember doing so on the approach of the 
accident. He did not observe an audible landing gear warning horn during the approach. The 
pilot stated that he was distracted with testing his air conditioner and thought he noticed an 
odd smell in the cockpit, which he thought may have been the air conditioner malfunctioning. 
The airplane touched down on the runway surface with the landing gear retracted, resulting in 
substantial damage to the fuselage structure and engine. 
During examination by maintenance and Federal Aviation Administration personnel, the 
landing gear was sequenced several times using both normal and emergency modes, with no 
abnormalities noted. The red gear up warning light, green gear down light and audible warning 
horn all functioned properly. The pilot stated that during the airplane's last annual inspection 
the audible warning system was noted to be out of adjustment. This issue was not duplicated 
during the examination. Examination of the landing gear system revealed no evidence of 
mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
