WPR13CA355

Registration:
N2926M
Aircraft:
MOONEY M20F
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Runway excursion
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The  flight instructor reported that the purpose of the flight was for the pilot-undergoing 
instruction  to perform touch-and-go practice takeoffs and landings. During the approach, the 
airplane was slightly fast and touched down about halfway down the runway. The instructor 
thought the pilot could still successfully complete a takeoff and monitored him as he retracted 
the flaps. As the airplane continued down the runway, the instructor decided that the airplane™s 
climb performance would not be sufficient to clear obstacles at the end of the runway and he 
opted to abort the takeoff. The instructor retarded the throttle lever to the closed position and 
told the pilot to apply maximum braking pressure. The airplane subsequently went off the end 
of runway into a grass field and continued about 100 feet before impacting a chain-link fence. 
During the accident sequence, the wing spar was substantially damaged. 
The airplane™s brake pedals were only accessible to the left-seated person, which is where the 
pilot was positioned. The instructor reported no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation. He additionally stated that this accident 
could have been prevented by making a timely decision to go-around when it was apparent that 
the airplane was going to touchdown further down the runway.

Note:

to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=87656
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
