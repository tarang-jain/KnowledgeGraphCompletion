Registration:
N5100V
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172RG
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Landing gear not configured
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The pilot reported that he was receiving instruction in an airplane with retractable landing 
gear. He further reported that during landing, the airplane touched down and began sliding on 
the concrete runway, and he "knew something was wrong". 
The flight instructor reported that he was the pilot in command of the airplane and that on 
final both pilots were on the controls. He further reported that he realized there was an issue 
when he heard metal on pavement.
The airplane impacted the runway with its landing gear retracted, causing substantial damage 
to the fuselage and bulkhead.
The pilot receiving instruction reported that there were no pre impact mechanical failures or 
malfunctions with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. There 
was a post-accident landing gear aural warning horn check/test conducted, with no 
maintenance issues found.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor and pilot receiving instruction's omission to use an appropriate checklist 
and extend the landing gear prior to landing, which resulted in substantial damage to the 
aircraft's fuselage and bulkhead.

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=93573
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
