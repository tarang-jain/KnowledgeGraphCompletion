Location:
Bridgeport, CA
Accident Number:
WPR16LA136
Date & Time:

Registration:
N2181K
Aircraft:
ROCHLIN PAUL JR RANS S6

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On July 1, 2016, about 1040 Pacific daylight time, an experimental Rans S6ES airplane, 
N2181K, impacted terrain about 1 1/2 miles north of the Bryant Field Airport (O57), 
Bridgeport, California. The pilot, the sole occupant, was seriously injured; the airplane 
sustained substantial damage. The airplane was registered to, and operated by, the pilot under 
the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The flight originated from 
Auburn Municipal Airport (AUN), Auburn, California, at an unknown time, and was destined 
for O57. Visual meteorological (VMC) conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.
The pilot reported to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that upon nearing his 
destination of O57, he flew over his parents' home to let them know that he was landing at the 
airport, and for them to pick him up. After passing over the home, with the intention of landing 
at O57, he turned sharply to the right then remembers the ground coming up into view.
An FAA inspector documented and photographed the accident site. The first identified point of 
contact was an area of disturbed dirt and impact marks with the ground on southwest facing 
sloped terrain. The impact marks were consistent with the airplane colliding with the terrain in 
a nose down attitude. The airplane remained intact and sustained substantial damage.
