Analysis   
The flight instructor reported that during taxi the airplane started to lean to the right, so he 
looked out of his window to see if the right tire was flat. He further reported that "the ramp was 
opening up into a 2 foot wide dark black hole" underneath the right main landing gear. The 
flight instructor and student pilot egressed from the airplane without further incident. 
A postaccident examination revealed substantial damage to the empennage. 
The flight instructor reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Photographs provided by Federal Aviation Administration showed that the right main landing 
gear had broken through the pavement into a sink hole underneath.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=94014
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
