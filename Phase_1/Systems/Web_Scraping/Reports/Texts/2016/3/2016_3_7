Location:
Rockland, ME
Accident Number:
ERA16LA137
Date & Time:
03/02/2016, 0800 EST 
Registration:
N198WA
Aircraft:
BEECH 99
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Turbulence encounter
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Non-scheduled
Analysis 
The commercial pilot was conducting a nonscheduled cargo flight. The pilot reported that, as 
the airplane was descending on an instrument approach, it encountered continuous light-to-
moderate turbulence. As the airplane descended through about 2,000 ft mean sea level at an 
airspeed of 130 knots, it encountered severe turbulence, and the pilot subsequently executed a 
missed approach and chose to divert to an alternate airport. The airplane continued to 
encounter light-to-moderate turbulence en route to the alternate airport, and the pilot landed 
the airplane uneventfully. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the airframe had sustained substantial 
damage during the flight. Although there were multiple AIRMETs for widespread moderate 
turbulence and low-level windshear, there were no pilot reports of, nor SIGMETs forecasting, 
severe turbulence at the time the pilot received her preflight weather briefing. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The airplane's encounter with isolated severe turbulence, which resulted in substantial 
airframe damage.

Factual Information
On March 2, 2016, about 0800 eastern standard time, a Beech 99A, N198WA, operated by 
Wiggins Airways Inc., was substantially damaged during approach to Knox County Regional 
Airport (RKD), Rockland, Maine, following an encounter with severe turbulence. The 
commercial pilot was not injured. Instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed, and 
an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight. The non-scheduled cargo flight 
was operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135, and 
originated from Manchester Airport (MHT), Manchester, New Hampshire, around 0730.
The pilot stated that the flight was in IMC on descent for the instrument landing system 
approach to RKD when the airplane encountered an area of continuous light to moderate 
turbulence. About 2,000 feet mean sea level (msl), and an airspeed about 130 knots, the 
airplane encountered severe turbulence, and the pilot initiated a missed approach. She decided 
not to attempt another approach to RKD, and instead diverted to Bangor International Airport 
(BGR), Bangor, Maine. She stated that the airplane continued to experience light to moderate 
turbulence enroute to BGR. After landing and securing the airplane, she entered the severe 
turbulence encounter in the aircraft log book.
Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that both 
wings exhibited skin deformation, and the fuselage side skins were wrinkled. Further 
examination by a local repair station revealed substantial damage to the right wing root 
between the fuselage and nacelle, just aft of main spar. The right wing root-to-fuselage fillet 
fairing was also damaged just aft of the main spar. There were several other areas noted with 
wrinkled skin on both wings.
The pilot held an airline transport certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land, 
multi-engine land, and instrument airplane. She also held a first class medical certificate, 
issued on March 15, 2016. Her last flight review was completed on November 24, 2015. At the 
time of the accident the pilot reported 3,600 total hours of flight experience, with 2,784 hours 
in the accident airplane make and model airplane. She had had accumulated 480 hours of 
flight experience in IMC, of which 295 hours were in the accident airplane make and model.
The RKD weather observation at 0756 included wind from 150 degrees at 20 knots, gusting to 
30 knots, visibility 4 statute miles in mist, ceiling overcast at 700 feet above ground level, 
temperature 8 degrees Celsius (C), dew point 7degrees C, and altimeter setting of 29.43 inches 
of mercury. Peak wind from 150 degrees at 34 knots was recorded at 0716, with pressure falling 
rapidly.
The Terminal Aerodrome Forecast for RKD, valid at the time of the accident, predicted wind 
from the southeast at 22 knots with gusts to 37 knots, and the potential for low-level wind 
shear at 2,000 feet, with wind from 180 degrees at 45 knots.

The National Weather Service issued multiple AIRMETs for the region, which advised of 
widespread IMC, moderate turbulence, and low-level wind shear. There were no pilot reports 
(PIREPs) or SIGMETs for severe turbulence in the area.
The operator's policy and procedures manual stated that it was a general policy of the company 
to suspend operations over a route that subjected equipment to unacceptable turbulence.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
