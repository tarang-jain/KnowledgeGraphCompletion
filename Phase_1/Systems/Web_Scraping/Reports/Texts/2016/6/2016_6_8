fuel tanks so that he could store the airplane over the summer. While returning to the airport, 
the engine experienced a total loss of power. During the subsequent forced landing to a small 
field, the airplane hit a tree, resulting in substantial damage. The pilot stated that when the 
airplane was recovered, both fuel tanks were empty.

Factual Information
On June 3, 2016, about 1030 central daylight time, a Smith Capella Aircraft FW2R/XLS 
airplane, N418DS, was substantially damaged during a forced landing near Alamo, Texas. The 
commercial pilot had minor injuries. The airplane was registered to and operated by a private 
individual under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. 
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The local flight departed 
McAllen Miller International Airport (MFE), McAllen, Texas, about 0900, and was returning 
to MFE at the time of the accident.
According to the pilot, the purpose of the flight was to use most of the fuel in the airplane, as he 
was going to park the airplane over the summer. In the past the automotive gasoline had 
"gummed up" his system sitting in the heat over the summer. 
The pilot flew to South Texas International Airport (EBG), Edinburg, Texas, landed, called his 
wife, departed and conducted a touch and go landing, and then returned to MFE. EBG was 17 
miles north of MFE. The airplane was at 2,500 feet above ground level and about 8 miles from 
the airport when the engine lost power. The pilot continued to fly the airplane towards the 
airport looking for a place to land while attempting to restore engine power. As he approached 
the airport his options diminished and during the forced landing to a small field the airplane 
hit a tree resulting in substantial damage to the wings and fuselage of the airplane.
The pilot stated that when the airplane was recovered, both fuel tanks were empty. He stated 
that he was confident that he just ran out of fuel resulting in the loss of engine power.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
