ROBINSON HELICOPTER R44

Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The flight instructor reported that during a helicopter "discovery flight" he was providing 
instruction to an airplane rated private pilot. The flight instructor further reported that prior to 
takeoff he told the pilot receiving instruction, "I am going to do the takeoff, and you can feel the 
controls." As soon as the helicopter entered a hover after takeoff, the pilot receiving instruction 
"put in strong left input" with the cyclic and would not stop after repeated instruction to let go 
of the flight controls. Subsequently, the helicopter's left main skid touched down and the 
helicopter rolled over and came to rest on its left side.
The tail boom was substantially damaged.
The flight instructor did not report any mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
The flight instructor reported on the National Transportation Safety Board Pilot/ Operator 
Aircraft Accident Report, within the owner/ operator safety recommendation section, he will 
not allow student pilots to touch the flight controls below 500 feet above the ground, until he is 
comfortable with the student.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot receiving instruction's incorrect action of interfering with the flight controls and 
failure to comply with the flight instructor's commands, which resulted in a loss of lateral bank 
control and a rollover.

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=93317
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
