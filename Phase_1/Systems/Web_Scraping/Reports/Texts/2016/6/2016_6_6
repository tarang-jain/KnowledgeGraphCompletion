Location:
Prospect Heights, IL
Accident Number:
GAA16CA280
Date & Time:
06/02/2016, 2010 CDT 
Registration:
N126RG
Aircraft:
STAUDACHER AIRCRAFT INC S 300
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Hard landing
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that he landed hard and bounced. The 
pilot further reported that after the bounce, he knew that the left main landing gear had 
collapsed, and he held the left wing off of the runway until the airplane slowed and the wing 
stopped producing lift. Subsequently, the airplane veered off the runway to the left and collided 
with runway signs, which resulted in substantial damage to the horizontal stabilizer. 
The pilot reported that the "½ inch fine thread bolt" on the left main landing gear failed during 
the bounced landing. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's incorrect pitch control during the landing, which resulted in a hard bounced 
landing, and subsequent left main landing gear collapse, a runway excursion, and a collision 
with a runway sign.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
