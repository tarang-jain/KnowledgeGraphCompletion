Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Nicolaus, CA
Accident Number:
GAA16CA303
Date & Time:
06/01/2016, 1145 PDT 
Registration:
N5091N
Aircraft:
AIR TRACTOR INC AT 502
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Low altitude operation/event
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis   
The pilot reported that while performing aerial application operations and flying under power 
lines, the airplane propeller struck a power line. Subsequently, the airplane vibrated 
excessively and the pilot performed an off-airport landing at a farm field.
The pilot further reported that during the landing roll, he could not maintain directional 
control of the airplane on the rough terrain; the airplane veered sharply to the right and the left 
wing impacted the ground.
The left wing sustained substantial damage.
The pilot reported there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's insufficient clearance from a power line during aerial application operations, which 
resulted in a power line strike, a forced landing on unsuitable terrain, loss of directional 
control, and collision with terrain.

Preventing Similar Accidents
Preventing Obstacle Collisions in Agricultural Operations
Accidents involving collisions with obstacles, including poles, wires, guy wires, meteorological 
evaluation towers, or trees, are among the most common types of agricultural aircraft 
accidents. Some collisions involved obstacles that the pilots did not see (even during survey 
flights), but others involved obstacles that were known to the pilot and/or had characteristics 
that would make them visibly conspicuous.
Agricultural pilots should do the following: 

Maintain a quick-reference document (paper or electronic) at the operations base that 
contains field maps, charts, photographs, and details of all known obstacles.

Frequently review current aeronautical charts for information about obstacles.

Before leaving the ground, spend time becoming familiar with all available information 
about the target field and programming navigation equipment. Such preflight action can 
help reduce the potential for confusion or distraction in flight.
Page 5 of 5GAA16CA303

Conduct aerial surveys of the target field but do not rely solely on an aerial survey to 
identify potential obstacles.

Conduct regular ground surveys of fields. Some towers can be erected in hours, and 
obstacles can change since you last worked that field. Speak with farmers and land 
owners to raise awareness about obstacle hazards.

When possible, use ground crews. They may be in a better position to see certain 
obstacles and help you ensure that your aircraft remains clear of them.

Watch for shadows and irregularities in growth patterns to help identify obstacles. Use 
GPS and other technology to maintain awareness of obstacle locations.

Be aware that workload, fatigue, sun glare, and distractions in the cockpit can adversely 
affect your ability to see, avoid, or remember obstacles. Heavier loads and higher density 
altitudes can affect the performance of your aircraft.
The National Agricultural Aviation Association's Professional Aerial Applicators' Support 
System reminds pilots that, when ferrying an aircraft or transitioning between sites, flying 
above 500 feet reduces obstacle collision risks: 'Ferry Above Five and Stay Alive.'

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=93368
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
