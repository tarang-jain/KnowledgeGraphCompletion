Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Centralia, IL
Accident Number:
CEN16LA096
Date & Time:
02/01/2016, 1435 CST 
Registration:
N41852
Aircraft:
RAYMOND Z BROWN CONDOR
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
A witness observed the sport pilot departing in his experimental, amateur-built gyroplane 
when, about 300 ft above ground level, the gyroplane turned right and the rotor blades began 
to slow. The gyroplane then made a sharp left turn, descended, and abruptly pitched up before 
impacting a field. A postaccident examination of the gyroplane found that the belt driving the 
prerotator had broken and had become entangled in the engine timing belt, which would have 
resulted in a loss of engine power. No other anomalies were detected with the airframe and 
engine. An autopsy did not reveal any medical concerns with the pilot.
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the prerotator belt, which impeded the engine's timing belt and resulted in a loss 
of engine power at low altitude. 
Findings
Aircraft
Main rotor drive - Failure (Cause)
Prop/rotor parameters - Not attained/maintained (Cause)

On February 1, 2016, about 1435 central standard time, an amateur-built Condor gyroplane, 
N41852, impacted terrain near Centralia, Illinois. The sport pilot was fatally injured and the 
gyroplane was substantially damaged. The gyroplane was registered to and operated by a 
private individual under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal 
flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated without a flight 
plan. The local flight originated from the Centralia Municipal Airport (KENL), Centralia, 
Illinois at an unknown time.
According to information obtained by the responding Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
inspectors, an instructor pilot rated eyewitness watched the gyroplane as it departed runway 
36. Upon reaching 300 ft above ground level, the gyroplane began a right turn. During the 
climb, the gyroplane rotor blades began to slow down. Another witness reported that the 
engine lost power. The gyroplane made a "tight" left turn towards the airport. It then rolled 
wings level and began descending in a flat attitude. Prior to impact, the gyroplane pitched up 
abruptly and impact the ground. The accident occurred about 1 mile from the airport.

The single-engine, two tandem seat gryoplane was manufactured in 2012 by the accident pilot. 
It was powered by a Subaru EJ22 engine driving a four-bladed composite Warp Drive propeller 
and equipped with Dragon Wings rotor blades. It was issued a Special Airworthiness Certificate 
as an experimental amateur build on December 22, 2012. The builder listed the gyroplane as a 
Condor and it followed the design of a Rotor Flight Dynamics Twin Dominator.
The gyroplane restraint system consisted of a single lap belt.

The gyroplane came in rest on its left side in an open field. All major components were located 
at the accident site. There was an impact crater located next to where the wreckage had come 
to rest. The fuselage was slightly twisted and the main rotor blades were bent, but remained 
attached to the rotor mast.
Medical And Pathological Information
As of the writing of this report, an autopsy did not reveal any medical concerns with the pilot. 
The manner of death resides with the Marion County Coroner and is still undetermined.
The FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute performed forensic toxicology on specimens from 
the pilot. Results were negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and drugs.
Survival Aspects
The pilot was wearing a helmet similar to a Comtronics Aircraft Helmet. However, its make 
and model could not be verified.
Tests And Research
The gyroplane was recovered to a hanger and examined by the FAA inspector. They found that 
the belt driving the prerotator had broken and had become entangled in the timing belt. No 
other anomalies were detected with the airframe and engine. The gyroplane's prerotator had a 
freewheeling mechanism which would allow for free rotation of the rotor system. In addition, 
the prerotator would not have been engage during the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
