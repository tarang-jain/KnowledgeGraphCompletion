Date & Time:

Registration:
N6960F
Aircraft:
CESSNA 150
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Miscellaneous/other
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The owner of the airplane reported that the solo student pilot told him that the airplane 
"bounced upon touchdown." He further reported that the solo student pilot executed a "go-
around," and "determined the climb out rate was insufficient to clear the trees and the airspeed 
and altitude were insufficient to permit a safe course adjustment to avoid the tree line." The 
airplane touched down on a field with "plowed soft soil," the nose wheel collapsed, and the 
airplane nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing, the vertical 
stabilizer, and the rudder.
The owner did not report any preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe 
or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to achieve an adequate climb rate while turning to avoid obstacles 
during an aborted landing, resulting in an uncontrolled descent, collision with terrain, and a 
nose over.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
