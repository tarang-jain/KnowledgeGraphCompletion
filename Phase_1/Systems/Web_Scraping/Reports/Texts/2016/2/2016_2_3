CEN16LA097
Date & Time:
02/01/2016, 1715 CST 
Registration:
N1572J
Aircraft:
PIPER PA 28-140
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Collision during takeoff/land
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The commercial pilot was performing the fourth in a series of landings at dusk. While on final 
approach, the low-wing airplane's landing gear impacted a tractor-trailer traveling on the 
highway perpendicular to the runway. All three of the airplane's landing gear separated, and 
the pilot performed a go-around followed by a "belly" landing to the parallel grass runway.
Following a similar accident about 19 years earlier, the airport installed a precision approach 
path indicator (PAPI) to provide visual glidepath guidance for pilots. The PAPI was inoperative 
at the time of the accident, and the airport had not issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) to alert 
pilots of this fact. It is likely that the pilot's visual references were reduced due to the dusk 
conditions, and it is probable that, had the PAPI been operative and providing corrective 
feedback to the pilot, he would have adjusted the airplane's excessively low glidepath 
accordingly. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain a proper glidepath during a landing at dusk, which resulted in 
impact with a moving ground vehicle. Contributing to the accident was the inoperative 
precision approach path indicator.

Factual Information
On February 1, 2016, about 1715 central standard time, a Piper PA 28-140 airplane, N1572J, 
collided with a moving vehicle while on short final approach to runway 26L at the Sylvania 
Airport (C89), near Sturtevant, Wisconsin. The commercial pilot and his passenger were 
uninjured. The airplane sustained substantial fuselage damage when the landing gear 
separated from the airplane during the vehicle collision and during the subsequent landing on 
runway 26R without landing gear. The airplane was registered to Blue Moon Aviation LLC and 
was operated by the pilot as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed in the area of the accident site about the time of the 
accident and the flight was not operated on a flight plan. The local flight originated from the 
John H Batten Airport (RAC), near Racine, Wisconsin, about 1615.
According to the pilot's accident report, he departed from RAC and performed four landings at 
C89. He departed from C89 about 1635 to view some local sights and returned to C89 about 
1710 where he performed two more landings on "runway 26." He stated, in part, that "during 
the final approach on a 3rd landing, the aircraft's landing gear clipped the top back of a tractor-
trailer, resulting in the loss of all 3 landing gear." The pilot performed a go around and landed 
on the grass runway. He reported that the belly landing was "smooth." He stated that the visual 
approach slope indicator was inoperative at the time of the accident.
The separated landing gear came to rest on Interstate Highway 94. The highway's shoulder was 
about 350 feet east of the runway's displaced threshold. The highway did not have any caution 
signs warning drivers of low flying airplanes. A vehicle in the northbound lanes of the highway 
impacted a separated landing gear.
The impacted tractor-trailer was reported to have a red colored tractor and white trailer. The 
tractor-trailer did not stop following the impact with the airplane.
N1572J, a 1967 Piper PA 28-140, serial number 28-23978, was a single-engine, low wing, four-
place airplane, with fixed tricycle landing gear. The airplane's last annual inspection was 
completed on June 2, 2015.
At 1653, the recorded weather at the Kenosha Municipal Airport, near Kenosha, Wisconsin, 
was: Wind 290 degrees at 3 knots; visibility 10 statute miles; sky condition clear; temperature 
3 degrees C; dew point -2 degrees C; altimeter 30.05 inches of mercury. According to the U.S. 
Naval Observatory, sunset in the Sturtevant, Wisconsin, area was 1704.
The pilot reported dusk conditions were present at the time of the accident. The published end 
of civil twilight was 1734.
C89 was a non-towered airport, which was privately owned and was open to the public. It was 
located about three miles west of Sturtevant, Wisconsin. The airport had an estimated 
elevation of 788 feet above mean sea level. The airport was serviced by two runways, 8L/26R 
and 8R/26L. Runway 8R/26L was a 2,272 foot by 38 foot asphalt runway. Runway 8L/26R 
Page 4 of 7CEN16LA097
was a 2,343 foot by 120 foot turf runway. According to the airport's master record, the left side 
of runway 26L was equipped with a two-light precision approach path indicator (PAPI).
According to National Transportation Safety Board report CHI98LA061, on December 13, 
1997, at 1545 central standard time (cst), a Piper PA-28-140, N5454S, piloted by a student 
pilot, was destroyed during a collision with a moving tractor-trailer truck and terrain while on 
short final approach to runway 26L (2,300' X 33' dry/asphalt) at the Sylvania Airport, 
Sturtevant, Wisconsin. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. 
The 14 CFR Part 91 instructional flight was not operating on a flight plan. The pilot was fatally 
injured. The flight departed Sturtevant, Wisconsin, at 1540 cst.
The investigator in charge of the 1997 accident discussed the potential airplane and highway 
vehicular traffic conflict and suggested the "State of Wisconsin and airport owner provide 
usable glide path guidance for pilots landing on runway 26L." The Wisconsin Bureau of 
Aeronautics responded through a letter that, in part, said: "We have begun preliminary 
discussions with the department's Office of Transportation Safety. This office should address 
the glideslope indicator and its installation due to the multimodal benefits. We have placed the 
Sylvania Airport into a list of candidates for our Airport Marking Program. Completion of 
runway marking will be after the installation of the glideslope indicator system."
A PAPI was subsequently installed on runway 26L.
C89's manager was asked about the status of the PAPI. He indicated that it was out of service 
because of frost heaves in the winter that affect the PAPI installation. The PAPI's tilt switch 
reportedly senses it is not level following the frost heaving and shuts itself off so that an 
erroneous path is not indicated to pilots.
A Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) is a notice filed with an aviation authority to alert aircraft pilots 
of potential hazards along a flight route or at a location that could affect the safety of the flight. 
According to Automated Flight Service Station records, a NOTAM was issued for runway 26L's 
PAPI being out of service on February 2, 2016.
The Wisconsin Bureau of Aeronautics was informed of the accident with N1572J and asked if it 
is possible to get the PAPI installed properly. The Chief of the Aeronautical and Technical 
Services at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT) replied, in part, "In our 
1999 letter, we commit to opening a dialog with a different office within WisDOT to explore the 
applicability of their transportation safety program to the needs at C89. We also added C89 to 
the list for our runway marking program. However, neither of these initiatives resulted in 
WisDOT sponsoring PAPI work. Our records indicate that the airport installed them on their 
own and have been maintaining them since.
As a privately owned airport, C89 is not in our State Airport System Plan and thus, is not 
eligible for any state funding. Our Bureau of Aeronautic staff is more than willing to work with 
the airport and provide guidance to them so they may appropriately address the PAPI 
deficiency."
Representatives from the Bureau of Field Operations, Wisconsin State Patrol and from the 
Racine County Sheriff's Office were asked if the accident tractor-trailer was located. At the date 
Page 5 of 7CEN16LA097
of publication of this report, they have not indicated that the accident tractor-trailer has been 
located.
A representative from WisDOT reported that they intend to install caution signs that will alert 
drivers on the highway of low flying airplanes. The installation is planned for November or 
December 2016.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
