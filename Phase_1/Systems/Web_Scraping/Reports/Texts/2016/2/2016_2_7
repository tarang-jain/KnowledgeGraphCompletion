Analysis   
The pilot reported that he was flying over a snow covered dry lake bed and decided to "drag" 
the left main landing gear to "better assess the surface condition." When the tire touched down, 
the pilot reported, "Drag rapidly increased and sucked the aircraft down." The pilot attempted 
to abort the landing by adding full power, but the airplane sunk further into the snow, turned 
to the right, and nosed over. The fuselage and vertical stabilizer sustained substantial damage. 
The pilot reported there were no other mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to drag the left main landing gear on a snow covered dry lake bed, which 
resulted in a loss of directional control and a nose over during an aborted landing.

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=92692
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
