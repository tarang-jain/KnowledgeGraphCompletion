Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Guthrie, OK
Accident Number:
GAA16CA180
Date & Time:
04/02/2016, 2005 CDT 
Registration:
N359RJ
Aircraft:
LAMB-ROBIN BOWERS FLY BABY
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that during the initial climb, the airplane aerodynamically stalled. He 
reported that he was unable to recover the airplane due to the low altitude and the airplane 
impacted a field off the departure end of the runway. The airplane sustained substantial 
damage to the fuselage, right wing, and right elevator. 
The pilot verified that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
As a safety recommendation, the pilot reported that using full power on takeoff would have 
prevented the accident. 
The Federal Aviation Administration has published the Airplane Flying Handbook FAA-H-
8083-3A (2004). This handbook discusses stalls and states in part:
The key to stall awareness is the pilot's ability to visualize the wing's angle of attack in any 
particular circumstance, and thereby be able to estimate his/her margin of safety above stall. 
This is a learned skill that must be acquired early in flight training and carried through the 
pilot's entire flying career. The pilot must understand and appreciate factors such as airspeed, 
pitch attitude, load factor, relative wind, power setting, and aircraft configuration in order to 
develop a reasonably accurate mental picture of the wing's angle of attack at any particular 
time. It is essential to flight safety that a pilot takes into consideration this visualization of the 
wing's angle of attack prior to entering any flight maneuver.
Stall accidents usually result from an inadvertent stall at a low altitude in which a recovery was 
not accomplished prior to contact with the surface.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during the initial climb, which

resulted in an aerodynamic stall and a collision with terrain.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
