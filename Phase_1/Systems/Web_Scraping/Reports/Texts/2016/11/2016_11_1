Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Atlanta, GA
Accident Number:
ERA17CA047
Date & Time:
11/01/2016, 1535 EST 
Registration:
N525
Aircraft:
HAWKER BEECHCRAFT CORP G58
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Runway excursion
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
According to the commercial pilot, the multiengine airplane was about 5 miles from the airport 
when it was cleared to land on runway 3R. Then, about 1.5 miles from the airport, he accepted 
a landing clearance change from the air traffic controller to land on runway 3L instead of 3R. 
The pilot increased engine power and set up to land on runway 3L; however, the airplane was 
"fast" on final approach and landed "long." The pilot "stood" on the brakes, the left tire "blew 
out," and the airplane veered off the left side of the runway. After departing runway 3L, the 
airplane traveled through the grass and impacted asphalt of another runway, which was raised 
about 7 inches above the ground. When the nose landing gear struck the asphalt, it collapsed, 
and the airplane then came to rest. During the accident sequence, the fuselage and wings were 
substantially damaged. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures 
with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. The wind at the airport around 
the time of the accident was from 140째at 7 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain the proper airspeed during final approach and his subsequent 
loss of directional control during landing, which resulted in a runway excursion.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
