Analysis   
The pilot of a glider reported that during the landing roll, near the location where he wanted to 
stop, he felt a "thump." He further reported that he observed a person lying on the ground on 
the runway and did not see the bystander previously. 
According to the pilot-rated passenger, who was also the airport manager, the bystander was 
taking photographs of the glider and had moved onto the runway surface during the landing 
roll. Subsequently, the bystander was struck by the left wing. He further reported that he also 
did not see the bystander before the collision. 
The airport manager reported that the airport had a sign near the runway, which stated 
"Caution Aircraft Operations." Postaccident, the airport manager reported that he installed 
cones delineating the boundary of the runway and added an additional sign stating "Remain 
Behind Cones."
The bystander sustained a serious injury.
The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the glider that 
would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=94363
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
