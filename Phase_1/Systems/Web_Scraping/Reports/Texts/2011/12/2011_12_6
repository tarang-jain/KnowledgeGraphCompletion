Analysis 
A runway incursion occurred when a Boeing 737-700 (B737) was cleared by a tower local 
controller to cross a runway immediately after a Learjet 45 was cleared for takeoff on the same 
runway. The first officer of the B737 saw the departing Learjet and warned the captain, who 
stopped the B737 short of the runway edge. Air traffic control personnel did not take any 
actions to resolve the conflict between the two airplanes. Recorded data indicated that the 
Learjet passed within 287 feet laterally and 62 feet vertically of the B737.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
The tower local controller did not ensure that the runway was clear of conflict before directing 
the B737 to cross the runway, and other air traffic control personnel did not effectively 
intervene when the separation between the two airplanes became questionable.
Findings
Personnel issues
Identification/recognition - ATC personnel (Cause)
Decision making/judgment - ATC personnel (Cause)
Lack of communication - ATC personnel (Cause)

Factual Information
At 0907 on December 1, 2011, a runway incursion and operational error  occurred at MDW 
when Southwest Airlines flight 844 (SWA844), a Boeing 737-700, was cleared to cross runway 
31R immediately after Gama Charters flight 17 (GAJ17), a Learjet 45, was cleared for takeoff on 
the same runway.  After landing on runway 31C, the crew of SWA844 was instructed to cross 
runway 31R and contact ground control.  GAJ17 was departing from runway 31R at the time, 
and conflicted with SWA844 as the B737 crossed the hold-short line for runway 31R at taxiway 
N.  The first officer of SWA844 saw the Learjet departing runway 31R and warned the captain, 
who was at the controls, to stop.  The captain stopped the B737 short of the runway edge.  Air 
traffic control did not take any actions to resolve the conflict between the two aircraft.  After 
the incident, the captain of SWA844 said that the departing Learjet had overflown his aircraft.  
Recorded FAA data indicated that the closest proximity as the Learjet passed the B737 was 287 
feet laterally and 62 feet vertically.  Although MDW is equipped with an Airport Surface 
Detection Equipment Œ X (ASDE-X) ground movement safety system that included conflict 
detection and warning capability, the system did not sound an alarm during the incident.  
The 0851 weather observation for MDW was wind 180 degrees at 4 knots, visibility 10 statute 
miles, few clouds at 15,000 feet above ground level (AGL), broken clouds at 20,000 feet AGL, 
broken clouds at 25,000 feet AGL, temperature 1 degree Celsius, dew point minus 4 degrees 
Celsius, altimeter 30.26 inches of mercury.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
