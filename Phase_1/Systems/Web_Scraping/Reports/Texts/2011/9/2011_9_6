Analysis   
The pilot stated that, while on a local flight, he was circling a field when the engine stopped 
running. He then executed a forced landing to the field, which was not uniformly level. During 
the landing the right wing hit the ground and the airplane cartwheeled before coming to rest 
upside down. The pilot stated that he believed that water got into the gasoline, which caused 
the engine to stop running. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the wing 
was substantially damaged. No registration number was present on the airplane and no data 
plate was present on either the airplane or the engine. Review of Federal Aviation 
Administration records revealed that the airplane was not registered and the pilot was not 
certificated. The FAA also advised the NTSB that no maintenance records were recovered. 
Probable Cause and Findings

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=81880
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
