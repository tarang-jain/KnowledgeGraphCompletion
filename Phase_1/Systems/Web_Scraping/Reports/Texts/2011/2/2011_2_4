Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
After completing several practice landings and autorotations at the airport, the certified flight 
instructor (CFI) and student pilot departed for the practice area. The CFI demonstrated 
straight-in and 180-degree autorotations; the first 180-degree attempt began at 6,000 feet 
mean sea level and at 55-60 knots. During the second 180-degree attempt, he started about 
200 feet lower. The airspeed bled off to about 50 knots during the turn, and the main rotor 
blades™ rpms began decaying rapidly. About 200 feet above ground level the CFI attempted a 
power recovery, but the rpms did not increase with an increase in throttle. He unsuccessfully 
attempted to flair to bring the rpms back before attempting a full down autorotation. He put 
the helicopter in a level attitude prior to contact with the ground and the helicopter bounced 
upon initial contact; on the second contact, the right skid dug into the muddy ground and the 
helicopter rolled onto its right side. The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the 
airframe and rotor blades. The pilots stated that the helicopter had no mechanical failures or 
malfunctions prior to the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The certified flight instructor™s failure to maintain adequate main rotor blade rpm during a 
practice autorotation, resulting in a hard landing and rollover.
Findings
Aircraft
Prop/rotor parameters - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Instructor/check pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=78278
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
