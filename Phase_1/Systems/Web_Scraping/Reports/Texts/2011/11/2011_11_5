Location:
Chesterfield, VA
Accident Number:
ERA12CA059
Date & Time:
11/02/2011, 1220 EDT 
Registration:
N833
Aircraft:
BEECH F33A

Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel starvation
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The airplane had been fueled and then flown for about 3.25 hours prior to landing at a private 
airstrip. After dropping off a passenger, the pilot departed from the private airstrip and was en 
route to a nearby airport when the engine experienced a total loss of power. The pilot 
performed a forced landing into a reservoir, which resulted in substantial damage to the 
ailerons. The airplane was recovered from the reservoir, and about 20 and 12 gallons of fluid 
were drained from the right and left wing fuel tanks, respectively. The fluid from the right tank 
was determined to be aviation fuel; however, the fluid from the left tank was determined to be 
water only and void of fuel. The fuel selector was selected to the left tank. The postaccident 
examination revealed no other anomalies that would have precluded normal engine operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation, as a result of the pilot's improper fuel 
management.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
