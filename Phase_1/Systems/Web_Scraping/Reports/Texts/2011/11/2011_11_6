Date & Time:
11/02/2011, 1715 EDT 
Registration:
N212CF
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172R
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
After touchdown, with a left crosswind of about 6 knots, the student pilot reported a strong 
vibration in the wheels and a pull to the left. He applied power to abort the landing, but did not 
maintain directional control, and, as a result, the airplane departed the left side of the runway, 
collapsing the nose landing gear. Postaccident inspection of the nose landing gear shimmy 
damper revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot™s inadequate directional control during the landing roll.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Student pilot (Cause)

Factual Information
On November 2, 2011, about 1715 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 172R, N212CF, registered to 
FL Flyers LLC, operated by Frederick Flight Center, experienced a loss of control during 
landing at Frederick Municipal Airport (FDK), Frederick, Maryland. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for the 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) Part 91 instructional flight from Carroll County Regional Airport/Jack B 
Poage Field (DMW), Westminster, Maryland. The airplane sustained substantial damage, and 
the student pilot, the sole occupant, sustained minor injuries. The flight originated about 20 
minutes earlier from DMW.
The student pilot stated that the accident flight was his fourth solo flight. He departed FDK and 
flew to DMW where he performed a full-stop landing. He later reported noticing a "slight 
shutter in the wheels during the landing roll but no steering issue was noticed." He departed to 
return to FDK, and entered the traffic pattern for landing on runway 23. He reported that the 
approach was flown at 70 knots, and after a smooth touchdown, he reported that almost 
immediately he, ﬁ–felt a strong vibration in the wheels and a pull to the left–.ﬂ He applied 
power to go around, and attempted to keep the longitudinal axis of the airplane aligned with 
the runway but the airplane veered to the left and departed the left side of the runway. The 
airplane came to an abrupt stop with the nose pitched into the ground.
Postaccident inspection of the airplane and airport were performed by a Federal Aviation 
Administration airworthiness inspector. The inspector reported that black marks on the 
runway were noted to the runway edge, consistent with brake application. Inspection of the 
airplane revealed that the nose landing gear was folded under the airplane, and further 
inspection of the nose landing gear shimmy damper revealed no evidence of preimpact failure 
or malfunction.
A surface observation weather report taken at the accident airport at 1710, or approximately 5 
minutes before the accident indicates in part that the wind was from 160 degrees at 6 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
