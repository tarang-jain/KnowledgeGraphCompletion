Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot/owner of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that during landing the left main 
gear collapsed resulting in a ground loop. He stated to a Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) inspector that after landing the airplane seemed to oscillate then it pulled to the right, 
resulting in a ground loop into the grass on the right side of the runway. He also stated that he 
was not used to carrying a passenger in the rear seat. A postaccident inspection by an FAA 
inspector noted damage to the engine and strut mount assembly that was consistent with a 
hard landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
