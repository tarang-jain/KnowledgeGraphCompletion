Analysis   
According to a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, the pilot experienced a loss of lift 
while soaring and performed an 
off-field landing to a pasture. During the landing, a gust of wind blew the glider down an 
embankment and into a barbed wire fence. During the impact with the fence, the left wing 
sustained leading edge damage, and the empennage separated partially from the fuselage. A 
postaccident examination of the glider and its systems revealed no preimpact malfunctions or 
failures.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=80964
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
