Analysis   
According to the pilot, he had performed one go-around because he believed his speed was too 
fast. During the second attempt to land, the airplane landed hard and departed the right side of 
the runway. The right main landing gear separated and the nose gear collapsed. A postaccident 
examination of the airframe revealed that the engine was partially separated from the fuselage 
and there was substantial damage to the right-wing spar box. The pilot did not report any 
preaccident mechanical anomalies or failures.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
