Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Business
Analysis 
About 2 hours after takeoff the pilot contacted air traffic control (ATC) services requesting that 
the controller identify his airplane on radar and provide him with location information. The 
controller provided the location information and vectors to the requested airport. A review of 
the ATC communications indicated that the pilot was unsure of his location and was low on 
fuel. At this point in the flight, the airplane's center of gravity (cg) was calculated to be 2.3 
inches aft of the aft cg limit. Generally, as the cg moves aft beyond the aft limit there is an 
increasing likelihood that the airplane will enter a realm of decreasing pitch stability and have 
tail-heavy flight characteristics. The pilot attempted to land on a runway with an 80-degree 
crosswind that was 24 knots gusting to 28 knots. The airplane flew almost sideways down the 
runway and touched down on the runway several times before climbing back into the air. 
Surveillance video captured images of the airplane climbing above the runway; between 300 
and 400 feet above ground level (agl) it made a right-hand turn, then plummeted vertically and 
impacted the ground. The sudden change from a 24-knot left crosswind to a 24-knot tailwind 
during the pilot™s execution of the right-hand turn towards the downwind leg of the landing 
pattern, combined with some pitch sensitivity due to the cg location, most likely induced an 
aerodynamic stall and subsequent loss of lift that was not anticipated nor compensated for by 
the pilot. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of mechanical 
malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot did not receive 
a weather brief from flight services, nor had he logged in to the Federl Aviation 
Administration's on-line flight planning system.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot did not maintain adequate airspeed during the downwind turn resulting in an 
aerodynamic stall, in-flight loss of control, and spin. Contributing to the accident was the 
pilot™s inadequate preflight planning and exceedance of the approved weight and balance 
envelope.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF THE FLIGHT
On June 1, 2011, at 1433 mountain daylight time, a Cessna 172R, N475ER, while executing a 
go-around entered a rapid vertical descent and collided with the ground at the Wendover 
Airport, Wendover, Utah. The airplane was registered to G&B Investment Management, Inc., 
which operated it as a rental airplane under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 91. The private pilot and 3 passengers were fatally injured, and the airplane 
was substantially damaged. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a visual flight plan 
had not been filed. The flight originated from St. George, Utah, around 1200.
The pilot rented the airplane from G&B Aircraft Management on May 31, and departed from 
the Bountiful Utah Skypark Airport, where the airplane is based, for the purpose of flying 
himself and three passengers to St. George, Utah, for business purposes. The Bountiful Airport 
was scheduled to be closed for 2 days, June 1-2, for runway maintenance. Family members of 
the pilot stated to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officials that the pilot and his 
passengers planned to return by flying from St. George to Provo, Utah, on Tuesday, June 1st. 
Provo Municipal Airport is about 45 miles south of Bountiful. A witness that was with the pilot 
the evening before the flight and the morning of the flight stated that he was not aware of the 
pilot doing any flight planning while they were together.
The FAA provided radio communications and radar playback files of air traffic control 
interaction with the pilot, and Lockheed Martin provided a communications transcript of 
interaction between Prescott Flight Service and the pilot. The first communication between the 
pilot and the Flight Service Station occurred at 1403 when the pilot requested that he be 
identified by air traffic control, and given his current location. At 1406, Flight Service provided 
the pilot a frequency to Salt Lake Center, 125.575 kHz. The pilot could not establish 
communications on that frequency, and radioed back to Flight Service, who provided him a 
second frequency, 128.55 kHz. At 1420, the pilot contacted Clover Control (Hill Air Force 
Base), and requested guidance to the Wendover Airport. At 1422, Clover Control established 
radar contact, and told the pilot that he was 23 miles south of Wendover. The pilot then 
requested runway information at Wendover. Clover Control replied that runways 26 and 08 
were open, runways 12 and 30 were closed, and also conveyed the weather conditions at 
Wendover; VFR, winds from 220 degrees at 21 knots with gusts to 25. At 1423, the pilot asked 
for a heading to Tooele, but then decided to remain on course to Wendover. Between 1424 and 
1428, Clover control remained in radio contact with the pilot, and ensured that the pilot had 
the Wendover airport in sight before directing him to switch to the Wendover common airport 
advisory (UNICOM) frequency. A recording of the Wendover frequency had the pilot making 
standard traffic radio calls starting at 1429, and at 1431, the pilot stated that he was on final for 
runway 26. Wendover operations radioed the pilot to see if he needed fuel services, and the 
pilot replied that he will need fuel.
Witnesses who were working on runways 30 and 12 at Wendover observed the airplane 
attempt to land on runway 26. Witnesses described the airplane touching down on the runway 
multiple times, and flying down the runway sideways with the nose pointing into the wind 
before starting a climb out. When the airplane had regained a few hundred feet above the 
runway it turned north, turning down wind. As the airplane made its turn to the north, witness 
stated that the airplane suddenly rolled and descended straight down.

Video imagery of the accident was captured by a surveillance camera that was mounted on the 
Wendover Airport Terminal building, which is located north of the runways. The video 
depicted a small airplane traveling over the runway, gaining altitude, which then made a turn 
towards the camera, and then suddenly descending vertically into the ground.
The airspace between St George and Wendover to the north-northwest, contained the following 
special use airspace areas; restricted areas R-6405, R-402A, R-6407, R-6406A, R-6402B, and 
R-6406B, and the following military operating areas (MOA™s), Sevier MOA-A, Sevier MOA-B, 
Sevier MOA-C, Sevier MOA-D, and the Gandy MOA. Flight operations within these airspaces at 
the very least requires the pilot to check the scheduled time of use of each area, and in some 
cases coordination with the controlling agency prior to entry. A flight route to the north-
northeast of St George to Provo would be clear of the listed special use airspace. 
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
The pilot, age 57, held a private pilot certificate with a rating for single-engine land issued 
January 26, 2008, and a third-class airman medical certificate issued March 18, 2009, with the 
limitation that he must possess corrective lenses for near vision.  The pilot™s logbook recorded 
that his most recent flight was his flight review on October 8, 2010, and he had a total of 186.0 
flight hours at that time.  Since his flight review, G&B Aircraft Management rental records for 
the pilot show a single flight entry for 0.4 hours, on May 4, 2011.
AIRPLANE INFORMATION
The four-seat, high-wing, fixed landing gear airplane, serial number 17280670, was 
manufactured in 1998. It was powered by a Lycoming IO-360-L2A, 200-hp engine, and 
equipped with a McCauley fixed pitch propeller, model number 1A170E/JHA7660, serial 
number TL049. Review of the maintenance logbooks showed the most recent 100-hour 
inspection was completed on May 26, 2011, at a total airframe time of 7,392.3 hours. The most 
recent 100-hour engine inspection was also completed on May 26, 2011; engine total time was 
6,520.5 hours, total time since overhaul was 1,233.4 hours, and tach time was 5,495.5 hours. 
On scene documentation of the tachometer showed 5,511.7 displayed in the numeral dial 
window.
The most recent weight and balance record contained in the airplane™s pilot operating 
handbook recovered at the accident site was dated June 2, 2004, listed a maximum weight of 
2,558.00 lbs, and an empty weight of 1,670.17 lbs. A fuel sales receipt from Above View FBO in 
St George shows the purchase of 44.2 gallons of 100LL avgas. Fuel capacity of a Cessna 172R is 
53 gallons. The personal bags of the pilot and passengers were collected and weighed, totaling 
76.6 lbs. The pilot weighed 189 lbs, the passenger in the copilot™s seat weighed 165 lbs, and the 
passengers in the rear seat had a combined weight of 438 lbs. Total airplane weight, assuming 
a full fuel load, was 2,857 lbs, 299 lbs over max gross weight. The center of gravity (cg) was 
calculated to be 124.8 inches. The furthest aft cg limit as established by Cessna is 115.5 inches 
at 2,550 lbs gross weight. By mathematically extrapolating the aft cg limit to accommodate the 
2,857 lb airplane weight, the calculated aft limit would be located at 121.1 inches, which would 
place the airplane's actual cg 3.7 inches aft of the predicted aft limit. In general, the further aft 
the cg is located the likelihood of entering a realm of airplane instability is increased. For cg 
calculated with an empty fuel load, the airplane weight would have been 2,539 lbs, 19 lbs below 
maximum gross weight, and the moment would have been 117.8, 2.3 inches aft of maximum 
allowable. The technical representative for Cessna stated that the elevator trim tab was 
Page 5 of 8WPR11FA242
approximately 15 degrees tab up when examined on scene. The maximum upward travel limit 
for the elevator trim tab is 22 degrees tab up (+ 1 degree/-0 degree). The Cessna representative 
stated that this was a good indication the aircraft was tail heavy, but not beyond control.
The pilot who flew the airplane on May 27, 2011, said that the he did not recall any mechanical 
or avionics problems with the airplane, and that the stall warning horn was working properly at 
that time.
The Cessna Model 172R Pilot Operating Handbook (POH) states that the maximum 
demonstrated crosswind velocity is 15 knots, and is noted that this is not a limitation.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
Wreckage was located on flat desert terrain between the approach ends of runways 8 and 12. 
The debris direction was oriented along a magnetic bearing of 015 degrees. The entire airplane 
wreckage was located in the immediate vicinity of the initial point of ground impact.
The initial point of impact was identified by green glass lens fragments from the right wing tip 
position light. The distance from the initial point of impact to the main airplane wreckage was 
approximately 70 feet. There was disturbed earth leading from the initial point of impact to the 
main wreckage. The left wing was partially folded under the fuselage, and the right wing was 
folded over the right side of the fuselage. Both wings' leading edges were crushed accordion 
style, and the outboard leading edge section of the right wing was curled over the top surface of 
the wing. Ailerons and flaps were attached to both wings. Fuel was observed leaking out of both 
left and right wings. The cockpit instrument panel was severely fragmented, and the 
instruments displaced. The tail section was intact, with the vertical stabilizer in place with the 
rudder, and the horizontal stabilizer in place with both elevators attached. The outboard 
section of the left horizontal stabilizer and elevator was crushed laterally and bent upward. 
Control cables were traced from the cockpit to both ailerons; the right aileron control cable had 
separated at the wing root in broomstraw fashion. The flap jackscrew was fully retracted, 
corresponding to a flaps-up condition. Elevator cables were traced continuous from the cockpit 
to the elevator bell crank. The rudder cables were traced from the cockpit to the rudder bell 
crank; the left rudder cable was found separated in broomstraw fashion inside the aft fuselage 
floor assembly. The elevator trim actuator was measured extended 1.6 inches, which 
corresponds to 15 degrees tab up. The fuel selector was in the both position.
The engine, a Lycoming IO-360-L2A, was examined on-scene. The spark plugs were removed, 
and appeared to be normal per the Champion Aviation Check-A-Plug Chart AV-27, with no 
mechanical damage noted. The fuel servo and fuel flow divider contained fuel. The engine was 
rotated by hand and thumb compression achieved on all four cylinders. Approximately 4 
quarts of oil was drained from the oil sump. Both magnetos were rotated by hand and spark 
observed at all leads. The McCauley fixed pitch propeller was attached to the engine propeller 
flange. One propeller blade exhibited extensive blade face polishing, and was wrapped aft 
around the engine; the other blade remained straight, and exhibited moderate leading edge 
polishing.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION,
An autopsy was performed on the pilot on June 2, 2011, by the State of Utah, Department of 
Health, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner, Salt Lake City, Utah. The autopsy identified the 
immediate cause of death as blunt force injuries of the head, torso, and extremities.

Forensic toxicology was performed on specimens from the pilot by the Forensic Toxicology 
Research Team CAMI, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The toxicology report stated 10 mg/dL of 
ethanol detected in blood, 5 mg/dL methanol detected in liver, and 3.121 ug/ml acetaminophen 
detected in blood.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
The Wendover airport weather observation system (AWOS) recorded at 1435, wind from 200 
degrees at 24 knots gusting to 28; 10 statute miles visibility; and the sky was clear of clouds. 
Runway 12/30 at Wendover was closed for construction.
Prescott Flight Service has no records of the pilot receiving a weather brief on May 31 or June 1 
from Lockheed-Martin Flight Services or DUATS (Direct User Access Terminal Service), the 
FAA™s on-line flight planning system.
The following weather information was available to the pilot prior to his departure: 
AIRMET (Airmen™s Meteorological Conditions) TANGO issued at 0745 for turbulence and 
sustained surface winds greater than 30 knots for Nevada, Utah, and Arizona, developing from 
0800 to 1000 continuing beyond 1400, and ending between 1700 and 2000.
Terminal Area Forecast (TAF) for Provo issued at 0420; starting at 1200 winds 180 degrees at 
18 knots gusting to 28 knots, prevailing visibility 6 statute miles, and sky clear.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
