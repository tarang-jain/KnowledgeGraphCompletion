Analysis   
The operator reported that prior to the accident flight the pilot was distracted during a 
refueling operation. The distraction involved ground personnel entering the helicopter cabin 
after landing to discuss the next spraying operation with the pilot. After the conversation, the 
pilot departed without refueling the helicopter. While completing an aerial application, the 
engine experienced a loss of engine power. The pilot initiated an autorotation, during which 
the helicopter impacted terrain. A postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed the tail 
boom was partially separated and the landing gear skids were bent. The operator reported that 
approximately 3.5 quarts of fuel were drained from the fuel tanks, and 2 gallons of fuel were 
considered unusable.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to refuel the helicopter which resulted in a loss of engine power due to fuel 
exhaustion.

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=81377
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
