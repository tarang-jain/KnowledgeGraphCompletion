Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that he landed the airplane in a right crosswind and wind gusts. He applied 
a right crosswind correction, flared, and touched down with the right main landing gear on the 
runway. When the pilot removed the right crosswind control corrections, the airplane landed 
hard and as the nose wheel settled onto the runway, the airplane swerved to the left. The nose 
landing gear collapsed, resulting in substantial damage to the firewall and forward baggage 
compartment supports. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical problems with the 
airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to adequately compensate for crosswind conditions, resulting in a hard 
landing.
Findings
Aircraft
Crosswind correction - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
