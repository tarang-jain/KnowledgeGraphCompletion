Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Newman, CA
Accident Number:
WPR11LA179
Date & Time:
04/01/2011, 1020 PDT 
Registration:
N8812A
Aircraft:
EAGLE DW1
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Low altitude operation/event
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot reported that he was applying his fifth aerial application load of the day over a field 
that was split by power lines about 35 to 40 feet above ground level next to a road. The pilot 
had been flying under the lines unless a power pole obstructed the airplane™s flight path or he 
observed traffic on the road, which was fairly busy. As the airplane approached the road, the 
pilot noticed a propane truck at the last second that was approaching the airplane™s flight path 
from the right. He tried to adjust but did not clear the top of the truck; the impact separated 
the left main landing gear from the airplane. The pilot was able to maintain control, so he 
returned to his nearby home dirt strip. During the abrupt deceleration due to the separated 
landing gear, the airplane sustained substantial damage to both lower wings. The driver of the 
propane truck was not injured.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s inadequate visual lookout and failure to maintain clearance from a vehicle during a 
low-altitude operation.
Findings
Aircraft
Altitude - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Task monitoring/vigilance - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Ground vehicle - Effect on equipment
Terrain - Contributed to outcome

Factual Information
On April 1, 2011, about 1020 Pacific daylight time, an Eagle DW-1, N8812A, collided with a 
propane truck near Newman, California. West Side Aerial Applications LLC was operating the 
airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 137. The 
commercial pilot sustained serious injuries. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both 
lower wings from impact forces. The local aerial application flight departed a private dirt strip 
near Newman about 1000. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had 
been filed.
The pilot stated that he was applying his fifth load of the day, and was on the third pass of that 
load. He was flying over the field, and approaching power lines and a road that split the field. 
He normally flew about 3 feet above the crop, which was 3-foot-tall wheat. The power lines 
were about 35 to 40 feet above ground level (agl). He had been flying under the lines unless a 
power pole obstructed the airplane™s flight path, or he observed traffic on the road, which was 
fairly busy.
As the airplane approached the road, the pilot noticed a propane truck at the last second that 
was approaching his flight path from his right to left. He tried to adjust, but could not clear the 
truck. The left main landing gear separated after it collided with the top of the truck.
The pilot was able to maintain control of the airplane, so he returned to his nearby home dirt 
strip.
The pilot chose to land the airplane in the soft dirt next to the strip, and was not wearing his 
shoulder harness. During the abrupt deceleration due to the separated landing gear, his head 
was thrown forward into the instrument panel, which knocked him unconscious. He was 
wearing a helmet, but sustained serious injuries to his head. The driver of the propane truck 
was not injured.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
