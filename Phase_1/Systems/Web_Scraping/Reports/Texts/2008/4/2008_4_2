Factual Information
On April 1, 2008, about 0900 Alaska daylight time, a tailwheel and tundra tire-equipped Piper 
PA-22 airplane, N5840Z, sustained substantial damage when it nosed over during the landing 
roll at a remote, ice-covered lake, about 15 miles northeast of Ugashik, Alaska. The airplane 
was operated by the pilot as a visual flight rules (VFR) local area personal flight under Title 14, 
CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred. The airline transport certificated pilot, the sole 
occupant, was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was 
filed. The flight originated at the Ugashik Airport, about 0830.
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, Anchorage Flight Standards District Office 
(FSDO), Anchorage, Alaska, reported that he received a telephone call from the pilot. The pilot 
told the inspector that during the landing roll on the lake, the main landing gear tires 
encountered an area of water, and the airplane nosed over. The airplane received structural 
damage to the wings, wing lift struts, and the vertical stabilizer.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
