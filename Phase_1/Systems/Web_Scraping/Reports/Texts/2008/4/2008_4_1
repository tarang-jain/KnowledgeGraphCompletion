Accident Number:
ANC08LA046
Date & Time:
04/01/2008, 1540 AKD 
Registration:
N8327S
Aircraft:
PIPER PA-32
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of visual reference
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Non-scheduled
Analysis 
The pilot reported that he was in cruise flight about 700 feet agl over near featureless snow-
covered terrain when he encounter lowering ceilings. He described the weather conditions as 
rapidly deteriorating. He began a turn to reverse direction, and the airplane collided with 
terrain. His destination, about 10 miles away, was reporting a visibility of 2 miles in mist, and a 
ceiling of 400 feet broken. The ceiling was variable between 200 to 900 feet. A low ceiling and 
snow-covered terrain likely produced flat lighting conditions, making visual reference to 
terrain, and determining height above the ground difficult.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's VFR flight into adverse weather conditions that resulted in a collision with snow-
covered terrain during a turn to reverse direction. Factors contributing to the accident were 
low ceilings, flat lighting conditions, and the snow-covered terrain.
Findings
Personnel issues
Incorrect action selection - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Flat light - Effect on personnel (Factor)
Snowy/icy terrain - Contributed to outcome (Factor)
Low visibility - Contributed to outcome (Factor)

Factual Information
On April 1, 2008, about 1540 Alaska daylight time, a Piper PA-32 airplane, N8327S, sustained 
substantial damage when it collided with snow-covered terrain while in cruise flight, about 10 
miles south-southwest of Koliganek, Alaska. The airplane was being operated as a visual flight 
rules (VFR) cross-country air taxi flight under Title 14, CFR Part 135, when the accident 
occurred. The airplane was operated as Flight 245, by Peninsula Airways Inc., Anchorage, 
Alaska. The commercial certificated pilot, the sole occupant, received minor injuries. 
Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed in the area of the accident. VFR company 
flight following procedures were in effect. The flight originated at the Dillingham Airport, 
Dillingham, Alaska, about 1510, and was en route to Koliganek, with cargo and mail.
During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
investigator-in-charge (IIC), on April 2, the director of operations for the operator reported 
that the pilot was on the first segment of his flight from Dillingham, then to Koliganek, then to 
New Stuyahok, Alaska, and return to Dillingham. The pilot did not arrive in Koliganek, and an 
emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal was received from the airplane. The pilot was 
located by search and rescue personnel about 2040, and transported to Koliganek by snow 
machine.
In a written statement from the pilot on April 3, he reported that he was in cruise flight about 
700 feet agl, and the visibility was good until about 20 miles from Koliganek. The weather 
began to deteriorate rapidly, and the pilot decided to turn around. The airplane then collided 
with terrain.
Personnel from the operator reported that when they arrived at the accident scene to begin 
recovery operations, they found that the airplane collided with almost featureless snow-
covered terrain on a northwest heading. They reported the right main landing gear separated 
first, followed by the left main gear, followed by an impact that separated the right wing. 
At 1540, a special observation at Koliganek was reporting in part:  Wind, 130 degrees (true) at 
15 knots; visibility, 2 statute miles in mist; clouds, 400 feet broken, 1,300 feet broken, 8,500 
feet overcast; temperature, 34 degrees F; dew point, 32 degrees F; altimeter, 29.67 inHg.  
Remarks; ceiling variable from 200 to 900 feet.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
