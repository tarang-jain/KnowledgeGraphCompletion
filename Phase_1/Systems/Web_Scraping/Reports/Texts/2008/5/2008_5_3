Analysis   
The pilot was within  5 miles of his destination airport at the termination of a short cross 
country flight at 2000 feet above ground level.  When the pilot reduced throttle to begin his 
descent the engine went to idle and throttle control was no longer available.  The pilot decided 
to attempt to make his destination airport but landed in an open field short of the runway.  The 
airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing main spar.  The pilot received no 
injuries.  Upon investigation of the engine it was discovered that the throttle cable clevis swag 
failed at the cable housing and throttle control was no longer available.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
