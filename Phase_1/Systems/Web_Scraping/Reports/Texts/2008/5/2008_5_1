Aviation Incident Final Report
Location:
Uvalde, TX
Incident Number:
DFW08IA126
Date & Time:
05/01/2008, 1530 CDT 
Registration:
N603JS
Aircraft:
2007 Savage Air LLC EPIC LT
Aircraft Damage:
Minor
Defining Event:
Landing gear collapse
Injuries:
4 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot completed an uneventful normal landing after an approximate 45 minute instrument 
flight rules cross country flight.  While making a right turn to clear the runway the left main 
landing gear collapsed.  An on scene investigation was conducted by a Federal Aviation 
Administration Air Safety Inspector and it was determined that the damage to the landing gear 
and supporting structure was minor.   There was minimal surface damage to the wings and 
flight control surfaces.  Tire skid marks that matched the width of the main gear and followed 
the path of the airplane was consistent with initiating a turn at high speed.  The pilot and his 
three passengers were not injured and exited the airplane unassisted.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
The pilot's excessive speed during a turn off the active runway to the taxiway which exceeded 
the lateral limits of the supporting landing gear structure resulting in the collapse of the left 
main gear.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
