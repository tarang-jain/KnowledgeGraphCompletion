Analysis   
The pilot reported that during takeoff initial climb, a large bird impacted the leading edge of 
the left wing slightly outboard of the fuel tank.  The airplane immediately yawed and banked to 
left.  The pilot attempted to straighten the airplane and land, however, despite his control 
inputs, the airplane continued to roll to the left.  Subsequently, the left wing struck the ground 
and the airplane cart wheeled.  Examination of the airplane revealed structural damage to the 
outboard sections of both wings and empennage.  No mechanical anomalies were reported with 
the engine or airframe.  A large deceased goose was found in the debris field following the 
accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
