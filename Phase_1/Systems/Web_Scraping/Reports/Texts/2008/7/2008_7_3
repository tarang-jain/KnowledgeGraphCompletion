Analysis   
The airline transport rated pilot was performing his third takeoff of the day with a full load of 
chemicals on an aerial application flight.  On initial climb the helicopter did not have sufficient 
power to maintain the climb and began to settle.  The helicopter settled into a lake in 
approximately 5 1/2 feet of water.  The helicopter remained upright and sustained substantial 
damage to the drive train and rotor system as well as extensive water damage.  The pilot, sole 
occupant, was not injured and was able to egress unassisted.  The pilot stated in the Pilot / 
Operator Accident / Incident Report that the accident could have been prevented if he would 
have paid more attention to flying the helicopter than being concerned with mixing and 
loading of chemicals.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The plot's distraction with the chemical load resulting the failure to maintain control of the 
helicopter.  A factor was no suitable terrain for landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
