Analysis   
The pilot was performing an approach to the destination airport in his powered glider. The 
aircraft touched down and bounced.  It then began to veer to the right of the runway centerline. 
The aircraft then swerved to the left and the pilot could not regain control. The aircraft 
continued off the runway surface and down an embankment. The main landing gear 
encountered soft terrain and the aircraft nosed over. The pilot stated that there were no 
preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or engine. He noted that 
winds were calm. When queried as to the cause of the accident, the pilot opined that the 
aircraft had "too much energy" during the landing sequence.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper flare, inadequate bounced landing recovery, and his failure to maintain 
directional control.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
