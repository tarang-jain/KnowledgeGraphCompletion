Analysis   
The pilot reported that he took off and departed the airport traffic pattern. He stated that about 
two minutes after reducing power, the engine lost power. He stated that he checked the 
mixture and applied carburetor heat to no avail. He then announced his emergency and 
attempted to return to the departure airport. During the glide, he determined that he would 
not be able to make the airport and elected to land in a soccer field. After touchdown, he 
braked hard, but the airplane struck a berm which tore the nose landing gear from the 
airplane. Subsequent examination of the engine, carburetor, fuel selector valve, fuel shutoff 
valve, and the remainder of the fuel system failed to reveal any pre-impact anomalies.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power for an undetermined reason. A factor was the berm encountered 
during the forced landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
