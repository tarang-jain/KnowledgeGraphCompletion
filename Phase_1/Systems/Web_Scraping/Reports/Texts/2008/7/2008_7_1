Dwight, IL
Accident Number:
CHI08CA175

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
During initial descent the pilot selected the right fuel tank for the practice instrument approach 
procedure.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time.  The pilot performed a 
procedure turn to align with the instrument approach.  The engine lost power while turning 
inbound onto the final approach course.  The airplane was at 2,300 feet mean sea level (~1,600 
feet above ground level) when the engine lost power.  The pilot switched back to the left fuel 
tank but the engine did not respond.  The pilot performed a forced landing onto Interstate 
Highway 55.  During the landing rollout the right wing impacted a mile-marker signpost.  A 
post-accident investigation showed that the left and right fuel tanks were approximately 1/8 
and 1/2 full, respectively.  No anomalies were encountered during a post accident engine test 
run.  The engine started without hesitation and responded to throttle inputs.  The engine ran 
without difficulty on each fuel tank for a period of 4 minutes, on each magneto individually, 
and with the electric fuel pump turned off.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.  Contributing to the accident was the 
highway signpost that the airplane impacted during the landing rollout.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
