Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Telluride, CO
Accident Number:
DFW08CA221
Date & Time:
09/01/2008, 1630 MDT 
Registration:
N839QS
Aircraft:
CESSNA 560
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Windshear or thunderstorm
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Positioning
Analysis   
On final approach to land, the twin-jet airplane encountered an increasing headwind 
accompanied by a "Caution Wind shear" audio alert, while approximately 50 feet above ground 
level.  The airplane landed hard and bounced several times before departing the left side of the 
runway.  The airplane came to rest in an upright position and the pilot and copilot were able to 
exit unassisted. The forward pressure bulkhead, fuselage, and left aileron sustained structural 
damage during the accident.  In addition, the nose wheel assembly was found separated from 
the fuselage.  An examination of the nose wheel assembly revealed that the fracture was 
consistent with an overload failure.  No anomalies were reported with the airplane's flight 
controls or engines.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain control during landing.  A factor was the reported wind shear.
Findings
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Windshear - Effect on operation (Factor)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
