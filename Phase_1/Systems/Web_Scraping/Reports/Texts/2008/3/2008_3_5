MIA08FA070A
Date & Time:
03/01/2008, 0836 EDT 
Registration:
N244CU
Aircraft:
Ulrich Christen Velocity XL RG
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Ground collision
Injuries:
1 Fatal, 1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The accident, an on-ground collision between two airplanes at a non-towered airport, occurred 
when the lead airplane in a flight of four RV-8s, which had landed and exited the runway, was 
struck by a Velocity not associated with the flight. Witnesses stated that the flight of four RV-8s 
announced their intentions to land in formation on Runway 15 over the radio and on the same 
frequency that the Velocity announced its intention to conduct a straight in approach to 
Runway 15. The Velocity arrived on final just behind the fourth RV-8, and touched down on the 
runway close to the approach end. The Velocity then drifted left off the runway and onto the 
grass. It passed to the left of the three trailing RV-8s that were still on the runway, and struck 
the lead RV-8, which had cleared the runway to the left on a taxiway in the vicinity of the 
departure end of the runway. At some point prior to the collision, engine power on the Velocity 
increased. Examination of the Velocity did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical 
failures or malfunctions, and the weather in the area was conducive for visual flight rules 
operations.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot of the Velocity™s failure to see and avoid the flight of four RV-8s that had landed and 
were in the process of clearing the runway.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On March 1, 2008, about 0836 eastern standard time, a Velocity XL RG, N244CU, and a Vans 
RV-8, N128RV, registered to private owners, operating as 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) Part 91 personal flights, collided on the ground following landing on runway 15 at the 
Arthur Dunn Air Park (X21), Titusville, Florida. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and 
no flight plan was filed for either airplane. Both airplanes were destroyed by impact and post 
crash fires. The Certificated commercial pilot received serious injuries and the pilot rated 
passenger was killed in the Velocity. The Airline Transport Pilot and private rated passenger in 
the RV8 were also killed. The Velocity flight originated from Sebastian Municipal Airport 
(X26), Sebastian, Florida, about 0810. The RV-8 originated from Spruce Creek Airport (7FL6), 
in Daytona Beach, Florida, about 0805.
 
According to witnesses, the purpose of the arriving flights was for the participation in the 
Experimental Aircraft Association's (EAA) monthly pancake breakfast. There were several 
witnesses that had arrived at the airport, in airplanes, just prior to the accident. The witnesses 
stated that a flight of 4 RV-8's announced their intentions of landing in formation on runway 
15. Witnesses recalled hearing the Velocity announce its intentions for a straight in approach to 
runway 15; he arrived on final just behind the 4th RV-8, and according to the witnesses he was 
to close to the 4th RV-8 to land as a separate airplane. Following uneventful landings the 4 RV-
8's were exiting the runway at intersection B, to the left. The lead RV-8, N128RV had entered 
the intersection and was midway between runway 15 and the parallel taxiway when it was 
struck from the left side by the Velocity. The three remaining RV-8™s were still on the runway 
when the accident occurred.
Witnesses stated that the Velocity had landed on runway 15 following the flight of 4 RV-8's and 
ran off the runway on the left side, entering a grassy area separating the runway and taxiway. 
The Velocity continued in the grass and witnesses stated that they observed the Velocity collide 
with the RV-8 while in a left turn and with full engine power. Both airplanes exploded into a 
fire ball.
The extent of the velocity pilot's injuries precluded any interviews by the National 
Transportation Safety Board as of the time of this report.

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
The 0853 surface weather observation at Executive Airport (ORL), Orlando, Florida,, was: 
wind 090 degrees at 3 knots, visibility 10 miles, clear sky, temperature 64 degrees Fahrenheit, 
dew point temperature 52 degrees Fahrenheit, and an altimeter setting of  30.33 inches of 
mercury.
AIRPORT INFORMATION
Arthur Dunn Air Park (X21) was located in Titusville, Florida. Runway 15/33 was 2,961 feet 
long and 70 feet wide. The runway was paved with asphalt and was in good condition. Runway 
15 was the active runway at the time of the accident.
WRECKAGE INFORMATION
Examination of the RV 8 revealed that the Velocity struck the RV 8 from its left side; the 
Velocity passed through the RV 8 then continued to its final resting place.
On scene examination of the RV-8 found it in a grassy area adjacent to intersection B. The 
wreckage was on a heading of 280-degrees. The fuselage, cabin and left wing were consumed 
by the post impact fire. Flight control continuity was established to all flight controls leading to 
the cockpit area. Examination of the engine found no evidence of any mechanical failure or 
Page 4 of 6MIA08FA070A
malfunction.
On scene examination of the Velocity found it inverted 330 feet beyond the RV-8 coming to 
rest on a heading of 330-degrees. The fuselage, right wing and cockpit were consumed by the 
post impact fire. Examination of the engine found no evidence of preimpact mechanical failure 
or malfunction.
The Velocity's first touched down point was observed about 550 feet from the arrival end of 
runway 15 near the left edge. The left main landing gear departed the runway's hard surface 
about 733 feet from the arrival end of the runway and at 786 feet the left main gear returned to 
the runway's hard surface. After passing taxiway D, at 1,295 feet, the nose gear departed the left 
side of the runway and at 1,385 feet, the right main gear departed the left side of the runway. 
Both mains remained in the grass until impact with the RV8. Braking action was noted from 
the left main gear at 2,310 feet and the nose gear was observed in the grass at 2,331 feet and the 
right main gear braking action was noted at 2,367. The impact point with the RV 8 was 
measured at 2,391 feet from the arrival end of runway 15.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
An autopsy was performed on the pilot of the RV8 on March 2, 2008, by the Office of the 
Medical Examiner, District 18, Brevard County, Rockledge, Florida. The autopsy finding 
reported the cause of death as blunt force injuries of head and chest.
Forensic toxicology was performed on specimens from the pilot of the RV8 by the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City,

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
