Accident Number:
DFW08CA054
Date & Time:
01/01/2008, 1600 CST 
Registration:
N579RM
Aircraft:
Micco Aircraft Company MAC-145B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The private pilot was conducting a touch-and-go in a tailwheel-equipped airplane with a direct 
crosswind component of 15 knots gusting up to 20 knots from the left side of the airplane.  
During landing, the crosswinds began pushing the airplane to the right side of the runway.  
While correcting back to centerline the pilot reported that a combination of over-correction 
and gusty crosswinds caused a loss of control.  The airplane ground looped, departed the left 
side of the runway, and came to rest upright with the nose of the aircraft pointed 
approximately 180 degree from runway heading.  Damage was sustained to the wing spar.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control.  A contributing factor was the prevailing 
crosswind.
Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
