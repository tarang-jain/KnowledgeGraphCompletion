Registration:
N34168
Aircraft:
Cessna 177B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane struck a pipe, cartwheeled, and came to rest inverted, following a go-around from 
a simulated forced landing.  The pilot reported he had been taking photographs about 1,000 
feet above ground level, then decided to practice engine out patterns.  During the go-around 
from the second pattern he added power, retracted the flaps to 20 degrees, and was unable to 
prevent contact with the ground.  The pilot further stated that it "felt like the elevator stalled."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A stall/mush inadvertently encountered by the pilot-in-command.  Failure to maintain 
adequate airspeed for flight and inadequate remedial action contributed to the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
