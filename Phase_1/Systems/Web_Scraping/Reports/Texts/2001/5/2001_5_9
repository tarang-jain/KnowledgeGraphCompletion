Registration:
N9696B
Aircraft:
Cessna 172RG
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:

2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
According to the flight instructor and pilot receiving instruction, the student was 
demonstrating a commercial flight maneuver, at 2,100 feet agl, when they smelled an odor 
similar to "electrical burning."  The instructor told the student to terminate the maneuver and 
return to the airport.  While the student was terminating the maneuver, visible smoke 
appeared in the cabin, and heat was felt coming from beneath the instrument panel.  The 
instructor assumed control of the airplane.  The engine was shut down and a forced landing 
was executed to a field.  During the landing, the airplane encountered soft terrain, nosed over 
and came to rest inverted.   A plastic hydraulic reservoir, from the hydraulic power pack, was 
found melted and laying on the cockpit floor.  The hydraulic power pack was examined and 
functionally tested at Aero Electric Inc., Wichita, Kansas, under supervision of the FAA.  
According a report from Aero Electric, the power pack and its related components operated 
within manufacturer's specifications.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the in-flight fire for an undetermined reason, which resulted in a forced landing.  A 
contributory factor was the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.

Factual Information
On May 3, 2001, at 1300 central daylight time, a Cessna 172RG airplane, N9696B, was 
substantially damaged during a forced landing following an in-flight fire near Washington, 
Oklahoma.  The airplane was registered to Christensen Aviation Inc., of Wilmington, Delaware, 
and operated by Airman Flight School, Inc., of Norman, Oklahoma.  The flight instructor and 
private pilot receiving instruction sustained minor injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and a flight plan was not filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 
instructional flight.  The local flight originated from the University of Oklahoma Westheimer 
Airport, Norman, Oklahoma, at 1230.
According to the flight instructor and pilot receiving instruction, the student was 
demonstrating a commercial flight maneuver at 2,100 feet agl, when they smelled an odor 
similar to "electrical burning."  The instructor told the student to terminate the maneuver and 
return to the Westheimer Airport.  While the student was terminating the maneuver, visible 
smoke appeared in the cabin and heat was felt coming from beneath the instrument panel.  The 
instructor assumed control of the airplane.  The engine was shut down, and a forced landing 
was executed to a field.  During the landing, the airplane encountered soft terrain, nosed over 
and came to rest inverted.   
According to an FAA inspector, who examined the airplane, a plastic hydraulic reservoir from 
the hydraulic power pack was found melted and laying on the cockpit floor.  He stated that the 
left wing-tip, the right wing strut, and the vertical stabilizer were structurally damaged.  He 
added that the engine firewall was buckled.  
The hydraulic power pack was examined and functionally tested at Aero Electric Inc., Wichita, 
Kansas, under supervision of the FAA.  According a report from Aero Electric, the power pack 
and its related components operated within manufacturer's specifications.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
