Analysis 
The certificated commercial pilot stated that while on final approach to runway 33, he 
inadvertently allowed the airplane to descend below his intended glide path.  In an attempt to 
arrest the descent he applied full engine power, but the airplane continued to descend.  The 
airplane inadvertently touched down on the snow-covered approach end of the runway, about 
15 yards short of the runway surface.  As he attempted to abort the landing, the airplane 
become airborne, drifted to the left of the runway, and settled into an area of soft snow.   
During the second touchdown, the nose wheel collapsed at the firewall bulkhead.  The airplane 
sustained substantial damage to the engine firewall.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain a proper glidepath during final approach.  A factor associated 
with the accident was soft terrain.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
