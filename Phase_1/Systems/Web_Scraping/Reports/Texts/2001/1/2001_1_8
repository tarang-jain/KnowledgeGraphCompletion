Analysis 
The pilot was planning to practice landings on a snow covered field near his home.  He said 
there was 2 to 3 inches of snow at his house, but he did not check the snow conditions in the 
field before the flight.  The pilot said he was flying low over the field, dragging one tire in the 
snow.  The crust covering the snow broke, and the tire was pulled into the snow.  The airplane 
nosed over to the inverted position.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control during a landing attempt.  A contributing factor 
was his failure to check the snow conditions in the field before the flight.

Factual Information
On January 4, 2001, at approximately 1500 mountain standard time, an Aviat A-1A, N26HV, 
was substantially damaged while attempting a landing on a snow covered alfalfa field near 
Eden, Utah.  The airline transport pilot, the sole occupant in the airplane, was not injured.  The 
owner/pilot was operating the airplane under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed for the cross-country personal flight that originated from Ogden, Utah, 
approximately 30 minutes before the accident.  The pilot had not filed a flight plan.
The pilot said that he departed Ogden to practice landings on a snow covered alfalfa field near 
his home.  He said that the snow at his home was 2 to 3 inches deep; however he did not check 
the snow conditions in the field before the flight.  The pilot said he was flying low over the field, 
"dragging one tire [tundra tire] in the snow."  He said that the snow had a crust on it, and when 
the tire broke through the crust, it got "pulled down" into the snow.  The airplane subsequently 
nosed over onto its back.  The left wing spar, the two wing struts, and the rudder were bent.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
