Analysis 
A flight school Cessna 172N was destroyed during a departure collision with communication 
wires and terrain at Rialto, California, about 0023 hours.  The accident flight was returning to 
Hawthorne, California.  The pilot had obtained a standard weather briefing at 2319, for the 
return flight.  The pilot was advised of airmets for IFR ceiling and visibilities for his route of 
flight.  The airplane had been the subject of an Federal Aviation Administration ALNOT, issued 
at 2210, for failure to cancel an instrument flight plan with Southern California Tracon from 
Hawthorne to Rialto, an uncontrolled airport.  The pilot had obtained an FAA preflight weather 
briefing at 1551, for the flight to Rialto.  According to the instrument flight plan information, 
the estimated time of arrival at Rialto had been 1845.  Subsequently, the airplane was located 
at the Rialto airport parking ramp by county sheriff personnel.  The ALNOT was canceled at 
2240.  The operator stated that the pilot and passenger had flown to Rialto to visit with friends 
and were to return to Hawthorne.  The pilot was a flight instructor for the operator and was 
rated in airplane single engine land and instrument.  They reported that he had accrued 650 
total flight hours.  Radar data was obtained from Southern California Tracon and a plot was 
generated by a private vendor for Cessna Aircraft Company.  It shows the airplane circling back 
over the airport and heading northwest.  The highest altitude before coverage is lost is 1,700 
feet mean sea level.   
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's intentional visual flight into instrument meteorological conditions.  Contributing to 
the accident was the pilot's improper weather evaluation and lack of total experience.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
