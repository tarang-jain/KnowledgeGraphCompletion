Factual Information
On October 1, 2001, approximately 1500 central daylight time, an Air Tractor 402 agricultural 
airplane, N402RW, was substantially damaged during a runway overrun following a partial 
loss of engine power during takeoff from a private grass airstrip near Angie, Louisiana.  The 
turbine powered airplane was registered to and operated by Payne Flying Service of 
Pelahatchie, Mississippi.  The commercial pilot, sole occupant of the airplane, was not injured.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed for the 14 Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 137 aerial application flight.  The local flight was originating at the 
time of the accident.
The pilot reported that during the 18th flight of the day from the airstrip, the engine lost partial 
power during the takeoff roll.  The pilot aborted the takeoff; however, due to the insufficient 
runway available, the airplane overran the departure end of the airstrip and collided with trees 
at the end of the airstrip.
The reason for the loss of engine power was not determined.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
