Destroyed
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot said he was in a left turning descent from approximately 1,000 feet agl to 
approximately 700 feet agl when the airplane's left wing dropped.  The pilot said, "I applied 
right stick, and simultaneously the airplane entered a spin.  I pushed the stick immediately 
forward and applied right rudder - waiting for the aircraft to recover.  The aircraft recovered 
approximately 35 feet from the ground, below a tree line that was quickly approaching.  There 
was an area of open (unobstructed) ground to my left and I elected to land there.  During the 
landing one of the landing gear collapsed and I slid to a stop short of the trees."  The pilot said 
a fire occurred in the engine nacelle area.  "My extinguisher was not adequate to extinguish the 
fire and eventually the entire fabric A/C (aircraft) was consumed."  The pilot provided the 
following safety recommendation:  "Maintain adequate airspeed at all times when airborne."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot not maintaining adequate airspeed while maneuvering in the turn.  Factors relating 
to this accident were the low airspeed, the inadvertent stall, and the low altitude.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
