Location:
CLEVELAND, TN
Accident Number:
ATL01LA017
Date & Time:
12/03/2000, 1030 EST 
Registration:
N5288P
Aircraft:
Cessna 152
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The pilots had been conducting short-field takeoffs and, full-stop landing followed by a taxi 
back to runway 21. During the third takeoff, they experienced a total loss of engine power as 
they climbed through 100 feet. The CFI initiated a forced landing. The airplane struck trees, 
nosed over, and collided with a storage shed as he maneuvered the airplane for the forced 
landing. Terrain and other obstructions were unsuitable for a forced landing. Examination of 
the airplane and the engine assembly failed to disclose a mechanical malfunction of component 
failure. A review of weather data showed that conditions were favorable for the formation of 
carburetor ice. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power during takeoff due to carburetor ice. A factor was unsuitable terrain.

Factual Information
 On December 3, 2000, at 1030 eastern standard time, a Cessna 152, N5288P, collided with the 
ground during a short field takeoff from Hardwick Field Airport in Cleveland, Tennessee.  The 
certified flight instructor (CFI) received serious injuries and the dual student received minor 
injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local 
instructional flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  The flight was originating 
from Cleveland, Tennessee, at the time of the accident.
The CFI reported that he and the student pilot had been conducting short-field takeoffs and, 
full-stop landing followed by a taxi back to runway 21. The CFI stated that during the third 
takeoff, they experienced a total loss of engine power as they climbed through 100 feet. At this 
point the CFI took control of the airplane from the dual student and initiated a forced landing. 
The airplane struck trees, nosed over, and collided with a storage shed as the CFI maneuvered 
the airplane for the forced landing. The CFI stated that he elected the left maneuvering turn to 
avoid terrain and other obstructions that were not suitable for a forced landing. 
Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane rested about 250 feet left of the 
runway edge. Examination of the airplane and the engine assembly failed to disclose a 
mechanical malfunction of component failure. A review of weather data showed that 
conditions were favorable for the formation of carburetor ice.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
