12/03/2000, 1430 EST 
Registration:
N97MS
Aircraft:
Miller SLINGSHOT
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot departed the airport for a local flight and when he failed to return, a search was 
initiated for the airplane.  The airplane was found 2 days later in a heavily wooded area 7 miles 
south of the airport.  Examination of the airplane and an engine test run failed to revealed any 
mechanical deficiencies.  Information downloaded from the pilot's GPS revealed the airplane 
departed the airport and flew southwest in a relatively straight line to the accident site.  The 
last eight 'track points' indicated that the airplane initiated a gradual left turn from a heading 
of 272 degrees to 111 degrees.  During the turn, the airplane's altitude decreased from 626 to 
383 feet, and the airspeed decreased from 86 mph to 52.2 mph.  Examination of the airplane's 
logbook revealed that it had accumulated 40 hours of flight time since it was certificated for 
flight on January 30, 1998.  Examination of the pilot's logbook revealed about 125 hours of 
flight experience in the accident airplane, from February 15, 1998 to December 30, 1998.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane, and subsequent collision with trees.
Findings

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On December 3, 2000, about 1430 eastern standard time, a homebuilt Slingshot, N97MS, was 
substantially damaged when it collided with trees near Kingwood, West Virginia.  The 
certificated private pilot/owner was fatally injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed 
and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
The airplane departed Valley Point Airport (WV29), Valley Point, West Virginia, on December 
3, 2000, about 1400, and was reported missing later that day.  An ALNOT was issued, and the 
airplane was located on December 5, 2000, by the West Virginia State Police.  The airplane was 
found in a mountainous, heavily wooded area about 7 miles south of WV29, at 39 degrees, 29.7 
minutes north latitude, 79 degrees, 41.7 minutes west longitude.  
PILOT INFORMATION
The pilot held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single engine land.  He 
reported 1,000 hours of total flight experience on his most recent FAA third class medical, 
issued on May 7, 1999.
Examination of the pilot's logbook revealed four entries, which described his flight experience 
in the accident airplane.  The first entry stated that 26.5 flight hours were accumulated from 
February 15, 1995 to January 23, 1998.  The second entry noted 23.5 hours of flight time from 
February 15, 1998 to May 5, 1998, with a note that stated, "3 takeoffs and landings."  The third 
entry was dated from May 5, 1998 to August 5, 1998 and listed 60 hours of flight time, with an 
entry stating, "20 or more takeoffs and landings."  The final entry made in reference to the 
accident airplane noted 15 flight hours accumulated during the period from August 6, 1998 to 
December 30, 1998.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
The airplane was built by the pilot, and certificated for flight on January 30, 1998.  
Examination of the airplane's logbook revealed that it had completed ten flights between 
January 30, 1998 and April 20, 1998, and accumulated 40 flight hours.  The final entries in the 
logbook indicated annual condition inspections were performed on January 10, 1999 and 
January 15, 2000.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
The weather reported at Valley Point Airport,  at 1453, included clear skies, visibility 10 miles, 
wind from 020 degrees at 5 knots, temp 32 degrees Celsius, and dew point 13 degrees Celsius.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed 
that all major components were accounted for at the accident scene.  The airplane came to rest 
on an easterly heading, on the bank of a ravine, about 300 yards from a logging trail.  Impact 
scars were noted in the tops of 75-foot trees located 25 yards from the wreckage.
The airplane came to rest partially inverted.  The nose and the cockpit were upright and 
compacted at the base of a tree.  The rear portion of the fuselage was folded upward 160 
degrees, and was inverted above the cockpit area.  The right wing was disconnected from the 
fuselage and located beneath the airplane; the left wing was still attached to the airplane and 
Page 3 of 6NYC01LA050
displayed impact damage.  The fabric covering both wings was torn off.  Control continuity was 
confirmed from the control column to all control surfaces.  
The engine came to rest upside down on top of the airplane, still attached to rear portion of the 
fuselage.  Little to no damage was observed to the four-stroke, four-cylinder Rotax engine.  The 
spark plugs were removed and were light gray in color.  The crankshaft turned freely, and 
thumb compression was obtained in all four cylinders.  Both carburetors were loose, and both 
carburetor fuel bowls were removed and full of auto gas.  The auto gas contained no visible 
contamination.  Auto gas was observed in both fuel lines to the carburetors, and cable 
continuity was observed from the throttle to the carburetors.  The slide valves and butterfly 
valves in the carburetors moved freely.  The radiator, which was located forward of the engine, 
appeared clean and displayed no damage.  The exhaust system was intact and also exhibited no 
damage.  
The propeller remained attached to the engine and was intact.  Two of the three propeller 
blades displayed no damage, and one blade displayed impact damage.        
The altimeter and airspeed indicator were recovered from the cockpit, and indicated 3,220 feet 
and 75 mph respectively.  The fuel selector was selected to the "on" position and the ignition 
switch was also "on."
The pilot's GPS was found in the airplane and was operational.  It was retained for further 
examination.
TESTS AND RESEARCH
The engine was removed from the airplane and sent to a Rotax test facility in Sebring, Florida.  
The engine was examined on May 15, 2001, under the supervision of the FAA.  The 
examination revealed that the engine started through the normal start sequence, and ran 
continuously for several minutes.  The throttle was advanced to 3,000 rpm to check both 
ignitions, and a 200-rpm drop was noted.  This amount was in accordance with the current 
operators manual.  The throttle was then advanced to full power, and the engine ran smoothly 
for approximately 4 minutes.  The throttle was reduced to idle and then moved to the full 
forward position, to simulate a "go around" maneuver.  The engine accelerated smoothly, and 
without hesitation.  The maneuver was simulated several times and no malfunctions were 
noted.
The information from the pilot's GPS was downloaded and examined.  The information 
revealed that the airplane departed Valley Point Airport, and flew southwest in a relatively 
straight line to the accident site.  The last eight 'track points' indicated that the airplane 
initiated a gradual left turn from a heading of 272 degrees to 111 degrees.  As the airplane 
continued the turn, the altitude decreased from 626 feet to 383 feet.  At the same time, the 
airspeed decreased from 86 mph to 52.2 mph.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
An autopsy was conducted on the pilot by the Chief Medical Examiner, in Charleston, West 
Virginia.
Toxicological testing was performed on the pilot by the Toxicological and Accident Research 
Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
