Location:
SELLERSBURG, IN
Accident Number:
CHI00LA293
Date & Time:
09/01/2000, 1830 EDT 
Registration:
N1334T
Aircraft:
Piper PA28R-200
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane sustained substantial damage during a wheels up landing.  The pilot stated, "On 
the downwind leg gear failed to come down during prelanding checklist.  Attempted to recycle 
the gear down lever, with same results."  A FAA on-scene examination revealed that the 
landing gear powerpack's electric motor was defective.   The examination further revealed that 
during the last annual, a kit to delete the automatic extension features of the landing gear 
system was incorrectly installed.  As installed, the kit would not allow an emergency extension 
of the landing gear.  A FAA inspector stated, "Instructions allowed that once the kit was 
installed to perform a landing gear retract check to ensure that the operations of the landing 
gear was satisfactory.  [The airplane operator] failed to perform this portion of the operation." 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the improper servicing of the emergency extension assembly and the gear extension not 
verified by company maintenance personnel.  Factors were the failure of the hydraulic system's 
motor, normal and emergency gear extension not available to the pilot, and the wheels up 
landing performed by the pilot.

Factual Information
 On September 1, 2000, at 1830 eastern daylight time, a Piper PA28R-200, N1334T, piloted by 
a private pilot, sustained substantial damage during a wheels up landing on runway 18 (5,500 
feet X 100 feet, dry/asphalt) at Clark County Airport (JVY) near Sellersburg, Indiana.  The 
personal flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 91.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed 
at the time of the accident.  No flight plan was on file.  The pilot was uninjured.  The local flight 
departed from JVY at 1600.
The pilot stated, "On the downwind leg gear failed to come down during prelanding checklist.  
Attempted to recycle the gear down lever, with same results."  He said, "[An employee] of [the 
airplane operator] contacted me via UNICOM and we discussed options.  After moving to 
another common freq. (122.95), [the employee] suggested other alternatives such as slow flight 
with flaps extended to full, wigging the A/C, pull the circuit breaker to see if the hydraulic 
pressure would bleed off and the gear come down on its own in addition to the emergency 
checklist alternatives.  This all occurred over a period of about 2 hours.  At the end of 
attempting these alternatives, it was decided to gear up land on runway 18.  Neither winds nor 
weather was a factor."
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspectors performed an on-scene examination of the 
airplane.  The examination revealed that the landing gear powerpack's electric motor was 
defective.   The examination further revealed that during the last annual, a kit to delete the 
automatic extension features of the landing gear system was incorrectly installed.  As installed, 
the kit would not allow an emergency extension of the landing gear.  A FAA inspector stated, 
"Instructions allowed that once the kit was installed to perform a landing gear retract check to 
ensure that the operations of the landing gear was satisfactory.  [The airplane operator] failed 
to perform this portion of the operation."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
