Factual Information
On November 1, 2000, about 1520 eastern standard time, a Horne Bowers Flybaby, 
N4041A, registered to a private individual, operating as a Title 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight, 
crashed in the vicinity of Greer, South Carolina. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, 
and no flight plan was filed. The experimental, amateur-built airplane received substantial 
damage, and the private-rated pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured. The flight originated 
from the same airstrip about 20 minutes before the accident.
According to the pilot, his landing resulted in an extended flare that touched down at 
about the mid-length point of the 1,800-foot  runway and despite heavy braking on the grassy, 
down-sloped surface, ran off the runway end and into a fence.
According to an eyewitness to the accident, the flight's first approach resulted in a go-
around due to being too high. The second approach was too fast, resulting in a touchdown 
beyond the mid-length of the runway. The aircraft continued beyond the runway end, collided 
with a perimeter fence, and nosed over into a drainage ditch.
According to an FAA inspector, the accident occurred in the Lake Cunningham area of  
Greer, South Carolina, at a private airstrip named Flying Few Airfield. Examination of the 
aircraft revealed a broken wooden propeller, leading edge damage to the wings, and buckling of 
the fuselage behind the cockpit. The pilot stated to him that he may not have closed the throttle 
all the way on landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
