Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
BLOOMFIELD, NM
Accident Number:
DEN00FA082
Date & Time:
05/01/2000, 1810 MDT 
Registration:
N1606K
Aircraft:
McDonnell Douglas 369E
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Other Work Use
Analysis 
The helicopter had been used for fiber optic cable installation support operations earlier that 
day.  The helicopter landed next to a company fuel truck at a job site approximately 20 miles 
south-southeast of Farmington, New Mexico, and approximately 12 miles west-southwest of 
the accident site.  There the helicopter was refueled.  The pilot told the driver he and his 
passenger were returning to Four Corners Regional Airport in Farmington.  Shortly after it 
departed, an oilfield worker, investigating the source of a smoke plume, found the burning 
wreckage of the helicopter and notified authorities.  A severed static line was found nearby.  
The utility company estimated the height of the static line, at the point where it was severed, to 
be 39 feet.  The power lines were estimated to be 35 feet above the ground.  A toxicological 
screen revealed the presence of tetrahydrocannabinol (marijuana) and tetrahydrocannabinol 
carboxylic acid (primary inactive metabolite of marijuana) in blood, lung, and bile. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's intentional buzzing (low level flying), and his failure to maintain clearance with the 
static wire.  A factor was his physical impairment by a contraindicated drug controlled 
substance.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On May 1, 2000, approximately 1810 mountain daylight time, a McDonnell Douglas 369E, 
N1606K, registered to and operated by Winco, Inc., of Molalla, Oregon, struck a static line and 
impacted terrain 6 miles southeast of Bloomfield, New Mexico.  The commercial pilot and 
passenger were fatally injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan 
had been filed for the flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  The flight originated 
at a nearby staging area approximately 1800.
According to company personnel and other sources, the helicopter had been used for fiber 
optic cable installation support operations along the U.S. Highway 550 corridor earlier that 
day.  The helicopter landed next to a company fuel truck at a job site approximately 20 miles 
south-southeast of Farmington, New Mexico, and approximately 12 miles west-southwest of 
the accident site.  There the helicopter was refueled.  The pilot told the driver he and his 
passenger were returning to Four Corners Regional Airport in Farmington.  Shortly after it 
departed, an oilfield worker, investigating the source of a smoke plume, found the burning 
wreckage of the helicopter and notified authorities.  A severed power line was found nearby.
The accident occurred during the hours of daylight at a location of 36 degrees, 60.46 minutes 
north latitude, and 107 degrees 93.66 minutes west longitude, at an elevation of 5,500 feet msl 
(above mean sea level).
PERSONNEL (CREW) INFORMATION
The pilot, age 48, held a commercial pilot certificate, dated May 16, 1990, with airplane single 
engine land and sea, and rotorcraft-helicopter ratings.  He was also type rated in the Sikorsky 
SK-58 (VFR only).  He held a second class airman medical certificate, dated April 4, 2000, with 
no restrictions or limitations.  His biennial flight review was dated October 2, 1998.
According to the helicopter operator, Winco, Inc., the pilot had logged the following flight time:  
Total time, 20,478 hours; pilot-in-command, 20,128 hours; rotorcraft, 12,377 hours; time in 
make/model, 2,146 hours.  He was not military trained.  Company records, updated on 
February 15, 2000, showed the following:  Total time, 20, 478 hours; pilot-in-command, 
20,128 hours; MD-500, 1,596 hours; Bell UH-1, 5,477 hours; Bell 206, 647 hours; Bell 47, 402 
hours; Sikorsky S-55, 2,063 hours; Sikorsky S-58, 1,642 hours
According to the pilot's last application for medical certification, he estimated his total flight 
time to be 21,500 hours, 475 hours of which were accrued in the previous 6 months.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
N1606K (s/n 0331E), a model 369E, was manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Helicopters 
(formerly Hughes, now Boeing) in 1989.  It was equipped with an Allison (now Rolls Royce) 
250-C20R/2 turboshaft engine (s/n CAE 295241), rated at 485 shaft horsepower (shp), derated 
to 450 shp.
According to the maintenance records, both the airframe and engine had accrued 2,320 hours, 
and 45 hours since the last annual and 100-hour inspections (at 2,275 hours). 
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
Weather recorded at Farmington (FMN), located about 23 miles northwest of the accident site, 
Page 4 of 7DEN00FA082
was as follows:
2353Z (1753 MDT); WIND 240 DEGREES AT 7 KNOTS; VISIBILITY 10 MILES OR 
GREATER; SKY CONDITION CLEAR; TEMPERATURE 21 DEGREES C. (69.8 DEGREES F.); 
DEW POINT 27 DEGREES C. (-3 DEGREES C.); ALTIMETER 30.07 INCHES OF MERCURY.  
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
A severed static line, spanning a dry river bed in Kutz Canyon, was found 508 feet from the 
helicopter.  According to the Farmington Electric Utility System, two poles (one on a 75-foot 
hill on the west side) were 1,800 feet apart and supported the static line and two other EHS 
(extra high strength) power lines (3/8-inch thick).   Each power line, which remained intact, 
provided 8,000-volt service to oil and gas fields in the area.  No residential consumers were 
affected.  The utility company estimated the height of the static line, at the point where it was 
severed, to be 39 feet.  At that point, the power lines were estimated to be 35 feet above the 
ground.
The main body of wreckage lay 508 feet from the severed static line.  The direction was 335 
degrees magnetic.  There was a postimpact fire that consumed the cabin area.  Between the 
severed static line and main body of wreckage lay the rotor hub and four of the five (red, 
yellow, green, blue) main rotor blades.  One (white) main rotor blade separated from the mast 
and was located 600 feet northwest of the impact point.  Drive train continuity was established 
between the engine and rotor mast.  All main rotor blades exhibited midspan rotational 
damage and "chatter" marks.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
An autopsy (#2608-00) was performed by the New Mexico State Medical Examiner's Office in 
Albuquerque, New Mexico, on May 2, 2000.
In addition, toxicological screens were performed by the Medical Examiner's Office (#2608-
500-11SJ) and FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  
According to CAMI's report (#200000094001), no carbon monoxide, cyanide, or ethnol was 
detected in the pilot's blood, but tetrahydrocannabinol (marijuana) and tetrahydrocannabinol 
carboxylic acid (primary inactive metabolite) were detected in the blood, lung, and bile (see 
docket exhibits).
ADDITIONAL DATA/INFORMATION
In addition to the Federal Aviation Administration, parties to the investigation included Boeing 
(formerly McDonnell Douglas and Hughes) Helicopters, Rolls-Royce (formerly Allied-Signal 
and Allison) Engines, and Winco, Inc.
The wreckage was released to the insurance company's representative on May 2, 2000.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
