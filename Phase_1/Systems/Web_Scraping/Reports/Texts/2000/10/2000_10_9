Factual Information
 On October 2, 2000, at 1355 eastern daylight time, an Alvin R. Kemmet Tango 2 experimental 
homebuilt airplane, N29AK, registered to and operated by the pilot, was substantially damaged 
when it landed hard and nosed over at Hidden Lake Airport, New Port Richey, Florida.  The 
pilot received serious injuries, and the pilot rated passenger aboard received minor injuries.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight 
being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  The flight had originated from Cross City Airport,

The uncertified pilot reported that the airplane landed hard and proceeded to bounce twice on 
the runway before the nose gear collapsed.  The airplane skidded to the right off of the runway 
and hit a runway light with the right main landing gear.  The airplane then flipped upside 
down.
Examination of the airplane disclosed that , propeller strike marks were found on the runway 
at the point of gear collapse, and no mechanical faults or failures were found.  In addition, the 
pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions with the airplane.  The pilot did not 
possess a valid medical certificate or pilot's certificate at the time of the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
