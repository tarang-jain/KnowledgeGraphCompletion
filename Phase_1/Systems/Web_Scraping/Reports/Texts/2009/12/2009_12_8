Factual Information
On December 4, 2009, about 1530 Pacific standard time (PST), a Stinson 108-3, N6649M, 
overran the end of the runway during landing, and collided with a tree at Borges-Clarksburg 
Airport (CN13), Clarksburg, California.  The owner/pilot was operating the airplane under the 
provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91.  The private pilot was not injured, 
and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the firewall.  The cross-country personal 
flight departed Hayward, California, at an unknown time.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.
Witnesses, who spoke with the pilot immediately after the accident, reported that he stated he 
approached the runway too high and too fast, overrunning the end and colliding with brush 
and a tree.  The airplane came to rest about 20-25 feet beyond the runway. The airplane was 
subsequently moved to the ramp area.  
Post accident examination by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed 
substantial damage to the airplane™s firewall.  
At the time of this report, the pilot had not submitted the National Transportation Safety Board 
(NTSB) Form 6120.1, Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident/Incident Report, nor has the pilot 
responded to requests for information from the FAA.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
