Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Galliano, LA
Accident Number:
CEN09LA198
Date & Time:
03/02/2009, 0720 CDT 
Registration:
N410RL
Aircraft:
BELL 206
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Flight control sys malf/fail
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Ferry
Analysis 
The commercial pilot was starting the single-engine helicopter's engine when he heard a loud 
bang and vibration. He immediately shut down the engine and exited the helicopter. 
Examination of the helicopter revealed that the tail rotor driveshaft and coupling had severed 
just forward of the gearbox, which resulted in substantial damage to the tail boom. The 
helicopter had undergone recent maintenance to the tail rotor gearbox input seal which 
included the removal of the tail rotor drive shaft from the coupling. When the two components 
were reattached, the mechanic only hand-tightened the bolts, figuring additional maintenance 
was still planned for the gearbox. He then installed the tail rotor drive shaft shaft cover. The 
mechanic moved on to another project and did not make a logbook entry of the work that he 
had completed or that the bolts were only hand-tightened.  Another mechanic later performed 
additional maintenance to the gearbox, but the bolts were not checked since the maintenance 
manual did not require the removal of the tail rotor driveshaft cover.  A .2-hour maintenance 
flight check was conducted and the helicopter was returned to service.  The accident occurred 
on first engine start after it had been returned to service.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the tail rotor driveshaft and coupling during engine start due to the mechanic's 
failure to properly reattach the tail rotor driveshaft and coupling during maintenance.
Findings
Personnel issues
Forgotten action/omission - Maintenance personnel (Cause)

Factual Information
On March 2, 2009, at 0720 central daylight time, a Bell 206L-3, N401RL, was damaged when 
the tail rotor drive shaft and coupling severed while the helicopter was sitting on the ramp with 
the engine running.  The helicopter was operated by and registered to Rotorcraft Leasing 
Company, LLC, Broussard, Louisiana.  The commercial pilot was not injured.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the ferry flight conducted 
under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.
According to the operator, the pilot heard a loud bang and vibration shortly after starting the 
engine.  He immediately shut down the engine, and exited the helicopter.  Examination of the 
helicopter revealed that the tail rotor drive shaft and coupling had severed just forward of the 
gearbox, which resulted in substantial damage to the tail boom.
The helicopter had undergone recent maintenance to the tail rotor gearbox input seal which 
included the removal of the tail rotor drive shaft from the coupling.  When the two components

manual did not require the removal of the tail rotor driveshaft cover.  A .2-hour maintenance

NTSB accident and incident dockets serve as permanent archival information for the NTSB™s 
investigations. Dockets released prior to June 1, 2009 are publicly available from the NTSB™s

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
