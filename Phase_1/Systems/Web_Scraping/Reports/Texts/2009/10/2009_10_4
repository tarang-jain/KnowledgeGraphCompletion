Registration:
N74004
Aircraft:
BELL 47D1
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion
Injuries:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that he performed a preflight inspection of his helicopter "including 
checking fuel tank was full and without water or other contaminants." The cross country flight 
was estimated to be one hour and forty-five minutes. Based upon past performance and lack of 
guidance from the manufacturer, he determined that the helicopter consumed about 13 
gallons-per-hour, resulting in a total consumption of 22.8 gallons of fuel, which would leave 
approximately 6 gallons remaining in the 29-gallon fuel system. After one hour and twenty five 
minutes of flight time and approximately 5 nautical miles from the destination airport, the 
engine quit suddenly. The pilot performed an autorotation maneuver; however, the tail boom 
impacted a dirt and stone pile causing substantial damage to the tail boom. Post accident 
examination by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that "the fuel tank was 
empty" and a "small amount of fuel was found in both the carburetor and the gascolator." 
Samples from both were verified to be free of water or contaminants. A slight indication of blue 
fuel stain was found at the fitting for the fuel line which connects the fuel tank and the 
carburetor. Additional inspection and testing was performed by the helicopter™s Airframe and 
Powerplant maintenance technician twelve days after the accident in an effort to determine the 
origin of the fuel leak; however, the results were inconclusive. Fuel stains were noted on the 
carburetor around the split line of the two body halves, and around the fuel strainer screen on 
the left side.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=74840
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
