Arapahoe, NE
Accident Number:
CEN09LA558
Date & Time:
09/02/2009, 1040 CDT 
Registration:
N58163
Aircraft:
HUGHES 269C
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Unknown or undetermined
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
During cruise flight in a reciprocating single-engine helicopter, the pilot heard a loud noise and 
felt a vibration. The pilot immediately entered an autorotation and turned the flight controls 
over to the flight instructor. The flight instructor elected to continue the autorotation to an 
open field. During the landing the helicopter's landing skids stuck into the soft terrain, causing 
the helicopter's nose to pitch down and tail to pitch up. The main rotor blades impacted the tail 
boom, severing it; the helicopter subsequently rolled onto its side. An examination of the 
helicopter failed to find a reason for the noise and vibration.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A sudden vibration for undetermined reasons.
Findings
Not determined
Not determined - Unknown/Not determined (Cause)

Factual Information
On September 2, 2009, approximately 1040 central daylight time, a single-engine, Hughes 269 
helicopter, N58163, was substantially damaged during a landing after entering a precautionary 
autorotation. The pilot and flight instructor, were not injured. The helicopter was registered 
and operated by a private individual. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight 
plan was not filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 cross-country flight.
In a statement submitted by the flight instructor, he reported that while in cruise flight, they 
heard a loud noise and the pilot immediately entered an autorotation.  During the autorotation, 
the pilot relinquished the flight controls to the flight instructor.  The flight instructor elected to 
continue the autorotation to a field.  The instructor added that during the touch-down, the 
right front skid "sunk into the soft field", the helicopter's nose dropped and when the tail 
section rose, the main rotor blades severed the tail-boom.  The helicopter subsequently rolled 
onto its side.  
The pilot stated that, "they heard and then felt a vibration and a loud bang or explosion" that 
came from the aft section of the helicopter and so he entered an autorotation.
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, who responded to the site, reported that 
the helicopter's main rotor blades severed the tail-boom during the landing. 
An examination of the helicopter was conducted by an FAA inspector and a technical 
representative from the airframe manufacturer.  During the inspection the engine was started 
and ran normally.  The transmission rotated with oil visible in the sight gauge. The drive 
system's "V-belts" appeared undamaged and functional; the clutch actuator operated when 
electrical power was applied. The engine's lower coupling to lower pulley driveshaft was intact 
and the splined fittings were undamaged.  The helicopter's cyclic and collective controls 
exhibited continuity through the range of motion.  The main and tail rotor blades were 
examined; the tail rotor blades appeared undamaged. The main rotor blades displayed various 
degrees of damage, consistent with a sudden stoppage at low rotor RPM and blade impact with 
the tail-boom and ground. 
The reason for the loud noise and vibration was not found.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
