Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Cumberland, WI
Accident Number:
CEN09CA279
Date & Time:
05/03/2009, 1345 CDT 
Registration:
N5905L
Aircraft:
AMERICAN AA-1
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that the accident occurred during a crosswind takeoff from a turf runway.  
He noted that the airplane encountered an intersecting asphalt runway with a height difference 
that tended to "launch" the airplane.  The pilot stated that he was unable to maintain control 
because of the crosswind.  He attempted to continue the takeoff, ultimately continuing beyond 
the end of the runway, across a road and impacting a field.  The airplane sustained substantial 
damage to the right wing.  The nose landing gear, right main landing gear and right flap were 
also damaged.  The pilot reported a left 90-degree crosswind of about 10 knots at the time of 
the accident.  He commented that additional flight instruction from an instructor familiar with 
the make and model airplane would have been helpful.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain control of the aircraft during takeoff in crosswind conditions.
Findings
Aircraft
Crosswind correction - Not attained/maintained (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
