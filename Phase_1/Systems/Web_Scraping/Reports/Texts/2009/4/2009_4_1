Analysis   
The pilot was practicing takeoff and landings when he extended the landing gear and heard the 
landing gear motor start while the airplane was on the downwind leg to the runway. The pilot 
noticed that the landing gear was not down during the landing flare. The airplane touched 
down on the runway with the landing gear retracted, and the airplane skidded about 500 feet 
before coming to a stop. The airplane received substantial damage when the airplane's firewall 
and underside skin were damaged. During the airplane's recovery, the landing gear control 
handle was placed into the down position and the landing gear extended when the master 
switch was placed into the on position. Postaccident inspection of the airplane revealed no 
anomalies.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
