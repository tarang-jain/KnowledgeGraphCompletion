Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Phoenix, AZ
Accident Number:
WPR10LA044
Date & Time:
11/02/2009, 0850 MST 
Registration:
N909DA
Aircraft:
MCDONNELL DOUGLAS MD-90-30
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Birdstrike
Injuries:
70 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 121: Air Carrier - Scheduled
Analysis 
The flight crew reported that during climb to cruise they heard a loud bang, followed by a "pop" 
in the pressurization and loud noise within the cockpit. The first officer stated that prior to the 
loud bang he observed "several black dots" directly in front of him. The flight crew declared an 
emergency and diverted to their departure airport, where they landed uneventfully. 
Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed an 
approximately 18 inch by 21 inch tear in fuselage skin located aft of the right side flight deck 
eyebrow window and structural damage to the upper portion of the fuselage. Bird residue and 
feathers were observed near the torn area of fuselage skin. The Smithsonian National Museum 
of Natural History Feather Identification Laboratory performed DNA analysis, microscopic 
examination, and whole feather comparisons with museum study skins on the recovered 
residue and feathers. The analysis identified the residue and feathers as the remains of a 
Western Grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis). The weight range for the species complex is 
recorded from 906 to 1,429 grams, with an average weight of 3.3 pounds.

Factual Information
On November 2, 2009, about 0850 mountain standard time, a McDonnell Douglas MD-90-30, 
N909DA, was substantially damaged following an in-flight collision with birds during climb to 
cruise flight 25 miles northeast of the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX), 
Phoenix, Arizona.  The airplane was registered to and operated by Delta Airlines Inc., Atlanta, 
Georgia, under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as flight 1232.  
The airline transport rated captain and first officer, three cabin attendants, and 65 passengers 
were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules 
(IFR) flight plan was filed for the scheduled passenger flight.  The cross-country flight 
originated from PHX at 0841 with an intended destination of Salt Lake City, Utah.  
The captain reported that while climbing through about 12,000 feet, he heard a large bang with 
a "pop" in the pressurization.  Subsequently, the captain noticed that the noise level was very 
loud within the cockpit.  After a brief discussion with the first officer, the flight crew "decided it 
was a bird strike."  The first officer reported that prior to the loud bang; he noticed "several 
black dots directly ahead of me."  The flight crew declared an emergency and returned to PHX.  
The flight landed uneventfully about 10 minutes later.   
Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed an 
approximate 18 inch by 21 inch tear in fuselage skin located aft of the right side flight deck 
eyebrow window and structural damage to the upper portion of the fuselage.  Bird residue and 
feathers were observed near the torn area of fuselage skin.   Additional damage and bird 
residue was noted on the lower right side of fuselage.  
The Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History Feather Identification Laboratory 
performed DNS analysis, microscopic examination, and whole feather comparisons with 
museum study skins on the recovered residue and feathers.  The analysis identified the residue 
and feathers as the remains of a Western Grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis).  The weight 
range for the species complex is recorded from 906 to 1429 grams, with an average weight of 
3.3 pounds.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
