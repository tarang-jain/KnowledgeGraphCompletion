Analysis   
The pilot had recently purchased the airplane and was enroute to his home airport with 
another pilot when the accident occurred. While on final approach to runway 25 the airplane 
was "exactly on course;" however, during the flare the airplane veered to the left and the right 
wing lifted. The pilot applied full throttle and initiated a go-around; however, the airplane was 
"already in a stall." The airplane then impacted a sign, substantially damaging the left wing, 
before it came to rest in the grass. The pilot was able to taxi the airplane to the ramp when he 
observed 2 turboprop aircraft taxiing to the ramp in front of him. The pilot believed he 
experienced propwash from the other aircraft while he was landing. He additionally reported 
no preimpact mechanical anomalies with the airplane. The winds were recorded as variable at 
4 knots at the time of the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
