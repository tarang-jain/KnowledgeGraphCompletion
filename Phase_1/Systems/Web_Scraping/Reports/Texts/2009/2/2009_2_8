WPR09CA106

Registration:

Aircraft:
GRUMMAN AA-5

Substantial
Defining Event:
Hard landing

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The AWOS reported winds were from 101 degrees at 11 knots, but another airplane was landing 
on runway 24, so the pilot announced that he would follow that airplane for landing. His 
approach was high and fast and he applied full flaps early and reduced the engine power to 
idle.  The pilot reported encountering gusty wind conditions during the approach, but felt that 
he had the landing under control.  The airplane was nearing touchdown, about midfield, when 
it suddenly descended and landed hard on the runway and bounced back into the air.  The pilot 
said that the airspeed was about 60 miles per hour (mph), with no stall warning horn heard.  
The airplane was aligned with the runway centerline, and he felt that the airplane was under 
control, so he applied a small amount of power to cushion the touchdown.  The airplane 
touched down and then bounced back into the air again. The pilot said that the bounce was 
smaller and it appeared that the airplane was slower as well.  The airplane finally settled onto 
the runway; however, the right main landing gear touched down with more force and the 
airplane veered to the left of the runway and into a drainage swale. He was worried that the 
airplane would run into buildings or other aircraft, and since the airspeed was at 55 mph, he 
decided to get the airplane back into the air.  He proceeded with the go-around, and once the 
airplane accelerated to 80 mph, he retracted the flaps. At this point, the right wing struck the 
windsock pole and the airplane began to sink back to the gound. He placed the airplane in a 
nose high attitude in hopes of clearing the airport perimeter fence; however, the airplane 
struck the fence and cartwheeled before coming to rest upright.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate recovery from a bounced landing and failure to maintain directional 
control.  Contributing to the accident was the crosswind condition.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
