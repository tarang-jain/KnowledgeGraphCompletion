Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Union Mills, IN
Accident Number:
CEN09CA148
Date & Time:
02/01/2009, 1230 EST 
Registration:
N53576
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Collision with terr/obj (non-CFIT)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The certificated flight instructor (CFI) and student pilot departed on an introductory 
instructional flight towards a training area where they performed basic flight maneuvers. They 
then flew to an airport where the CFI demonstrated a simulated forced landing which was to be 
followed by a go-around to a runway that was reportedly covered with about 12-14 inches of 
snow. During the demonstration, the CFI reduced engine power to idle from an altitude of 
2,000 feet mean sea level and executed a descent to an altitude of about 5 - 6 feet above ground 
level at 60 knots indicated airspeed. The CFI did not increase engine throttle during this 
descent to clear the engine. The CFI applied full throttle during the go-around, but the engine 
hesitated and the airplane continued to descend. The main landing gear wheels followed by the 
airplane's nose contacted the snow. The left wing contacted the ground followed by the right 
wing.. Both wings buckled, resulting in substantial damage to the airplane. The Federal 
Aviation Administration Flight Training Handbook states in the section under 'Descents 
(Maximum Distance Glides)' that during power-off descents, the engine should be cleared 
periodically to prevent excessive cooling and fouling.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The certificated flight instructor's failure to follow correct engine clearing procedures. A factor 
was the unsuitable landing area.

NTSB accident and incident dockets serve as permanent archival information for the NTSB™s 
investigations. Dockets released prior to June 1, 2009 are publicly available from the NTSB™s

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
