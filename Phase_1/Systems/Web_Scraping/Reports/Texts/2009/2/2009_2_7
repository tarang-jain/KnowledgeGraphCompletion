Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
While en route to her destination, the pilot elected to fly the helicopter up a canyon toward 
rising terrain. Soon after making a low pass over a ridge above 8,000 feet mean sea level, the 
pilot increased collective in order to climb over upcoming higher terrain. As the collective was 
increased, the rotor rpm started to drop. The pilot immediately increased throttle, reversed 
course to fly downhill, and lowered the collective. During the turn, the helicopter encountered 
a quartering tailwind and began to settle toward the snow-covered down-sloping terrain. Soon 
thereafter the helicopter contacted the terrain, bounced back into the air, and a main rotor 
blade severed the tail boom.  The helicopter rotated 180 degrees, impacted the terrain, and 
rolled over. According to the pilot there was no evidence of an engine power loss or any 
anomaly with the flight control system.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper decision to fly at low altitude while maneuvering in mountainous terrain 
in a canyon and inadvertently exceeding the climb capability of the helicopter. Contributing to 
the accident were a high density altitude, mountainous terrain, and a tailwind encountered 
during the attempted course reversal.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
