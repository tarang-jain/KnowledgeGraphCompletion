Date & Time:
02/02/2009, 1850 CST 
Registration:
N5451P

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
While departing the airport, the airplane's landing gear system failed to fully retract when 
actuated by the private pilot.  Several attempts were made by the pilot to fully lower the 
landing gear, including the use of the "emergency landing gear system."  The pilot elected to 
return to the airport and land in the grass parallel to the runway.  During the landing the 
airplane's firewall was damaged.  An inspection conducted on the airplane revealed that the 
wire cables which operate the landing gear were insufficiently lubricated during the previous 
annual inspection which was accomplished 18 days prior to the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the airframe and power plant mechanic to ensure proper lubrication of wire 
cables in the landing gear system during the annual inspection which precluded safe operation 
of the landing gear system.
Findings
Aircraft
Gear extension and retract sys - Not serviced/maintained (Cause)
Gear extension and retract sys - Failure (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
