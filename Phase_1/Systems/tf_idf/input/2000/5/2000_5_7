extension and retraction system. The pilot also did not report a mechanical problem with the 
airplane. The pilot stated that he forgot to lower the landing gear, as stated in the normal pre-
landing checklist.

Factual Information
On May 2, 2000, at 1913 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 501, Citation, N56LW, landed with the 
right main landing gear partially extended on runway 18 at the Orlando International Airport, 
in Orlando, Florida.  The personal flight was operated by the pilot under the provisions of Title 
14 CFR Part 91 with no flight plan filed.  Visual weather conditions prevailed at the time of the 
accident.  The airplane sustained substantial damage.  The private pilot and his passenger were 
not injured.  The flight departed Leesburg, Florida, at 1850.
According to the pilot, while enroute to land he silenced the landing gear warning horn and 
forgot to lower the landing gear.  Just prior to the touchdown, the pilot attempted to lower the 
landing gear.  The airplane touched down with the landing gear in transit, and the right landing 
gear collapsed.  The airplane skidded approximately 2500 feet on the runway surface before 
coming to a complete stop on the runway.  The right wing assembly received structural 
damage, and leaked jet fuel from the bottom side of the right wing assembly.
The examination and the functional check of the airplane failed to disclose a mechanical 
problem with the landing gear extension and retraction system. The pilot also did not report a 
mechanical problem with the airplane. Reportedly, the pilot stated that he forgot to lower the 
landing gear, as instructed in the normal pre-landing checklist.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
