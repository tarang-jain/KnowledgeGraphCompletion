Wilson RAF 2000 GTX SE
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The gyrocopter sustained substantial damage on impact with a tree and terrain following a 
takeoff from runway 15 for a local flight.  The pilot and passenger sustained minor injuries.  
The pilot stated, 'I misread direction of wind from hanger area.  I taxied to north end of runway 
and took off south with a 90 [degree] crosswind.  When I passed over hanger area at the south 
end of runway I hit some turbulence.  I should have did a emergency landing in the field south 
of runway, but chose to continue.  At the south end of field that has trees on three sides I didn't 
have enough altitude to cross a ravine with trees.  I hit the top of a large oak tree and fell 50 - 
60 ft into the ravine.'  The pilot listed his certificate and rating as private and single engine 
land.  An on scene examination revealed no anomalies.  Wind at Quincy, Illinois was 210 
degrees at 7 knots.  The pilot's safety recommendation stated, 'Take off the other direction.' 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot not obtaining clearance from the trees.  Factors were the trees and the ravine terrain 
condition.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
