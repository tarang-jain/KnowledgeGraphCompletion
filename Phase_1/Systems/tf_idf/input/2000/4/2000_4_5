Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot decided to conduct a simulated engine failure over an agricultural field, with an 
intended recovery at '60-70 feet above the ground.'  When he was satisfied that he 'made the 
field,' a flock of geese distracted him, and the airplane struck a wire.  The pilot then returned to 
the originating airport to assess the damage to the airplane. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain an adequate visual lookout, due to his distraction with a flock of 
birds.  A factor was the pilot's improper in flight decision to continue the simulated engine 
failure to too low of an altitude.

Phase of Operation: DESCENT
Findings
1. OBJECT - BIRD(S)
2. (C) VISUAL LOOKOUT - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND

Factual Information
 On April 1, 2000, about 1700 Eastern Standard Time, a Mooney M-20F, N737HB, was 
substantially damaged while practicing a simulated engine failure, near Parker, Pennsylvania.  
The certificated private pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and 
no flight plan was filed for the flight between the Clarion County Airport (AXQ), Clarion, 
Pennsylvania, and the Venango Regional Airport (FKL), Franklin, Pennsylvania.  The personal 
flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
The pilot stated that he departed about 1600.  While en route, he decided to conduct a 
simulated engine failure over an agricultural field, with an intended recovery at "60-70 feet 
above the ground."  When the pilot was satisfied that he "made the field," a flock of geese 
distracted him and he struck a wire.  The pilot then returned to AXQ to assess the damage to 
the airplane. 
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector reported that the right wing, right aileron 
and the horizontal stabilizer were substantially damaged.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
