Location:
PROSPERITY, PA
Accident Number:
NYC01LA029
Date & Time:
11/02/2000, 1200 EST 
Registration:
N35241
Aircraft:
Cessna 177B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
While performing maneuvers, at an altitude of about 2,500 feet above the ground, the pilot 
heard a loud "pop," and the engine lost all power.  The pilot made a forced landing to a field, 
where the airplane struck a fence, before coming to rest in briar bushes.  When the airplane's 
dual magneto system was examined, both sets of points remained closed, regardless of the 
camshaft position.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the dual magneto ignition system points to open.

Factual Information
 On November 2, 2000, about 1200 Eastern Standard Time, a Cessna 177B, N35241, was 
substantially damaged after a forced landing near Prosperity, Pennsylvania.  The certificated 
private pilot and pilot-rated passenger received minor injuries.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight conducted under 14 
CFR Part 91.
According to the pilot, he and the passenger were practicing maneuvers, for the commercial 
pilot practical test.  While at an altitude of about 2,500 feet above the ground, the pilot heard a 
loud "pop," and the engine lost all power.  The pilot made a force landing to a field.  After 
touching down in the field, the airplane struck a fence and came to rest in briar bushes.
The pilot did not report any prior mechanical difficulties with the airplane's engine.
The airplane's magneto system, a Teledyne Continental Motors D-3000 Magneto Ignition 
system, was forwarded to Teledyne Mattituck Services Inc., Mattituck, New York, on January 
10, 2001, and examined in the presence of a Federal Aviation Administration inspector.  The 
inspector observed that both sets of points remained closed, regardless of the cam position, 
when the magneto system was tested.  The inspector also stated that all securing hardware 
torque seals were intact and there was no evidence of point adjustment shifting.
A Safety Board investigator examined the magneto system on February 7, 2001.  As the 
impulse coupling was turned, the lobes of the cam would not push the cam follower far enough 
to open the points.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
