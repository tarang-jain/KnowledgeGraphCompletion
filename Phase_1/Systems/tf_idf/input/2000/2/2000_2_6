Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
FARMINGTON, NM
Accident Number:
DEN00LA047
Date & Time:
02/03/2000, 0745 MST 
Registration:
N8240U
Aircraft:
Beech A36
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
To prepare the student pilot for his first solo flight, the flight instructor retarded the throttle on 
downwind to simulate a power failure.  The instructor said the student flared the airplane high 
over the runway and added power to adjust the sink rate and banked left 'to return to the 
centerline.'  The airplane landed hard on the left main gear and bounced.  The flight instructor 
took control, aborted the landing, went around and landed uneventfully.  Postaccident 
inspection revealed wingtip, aileron, and rear spar damage. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's excessive remedial action (banking to realign the airplane with the runway).  
Factors were the student pilot flaring the airplane prematurely and failing to maintain 
directional control, and the flight instructor's inadequate supervision of the student.

centerline."  The airplane landed hard on the left main gear and bounced.  The flight instructor 
took control, aborted the landing, went around and landed uneventfully.  Postaccident 
inspection revealed wingtip, aileron, and rear spar damage.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
