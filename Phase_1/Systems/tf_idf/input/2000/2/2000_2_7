Factual Information
 On February 3, 2000, about 0800 Eastern Standard Time, a Boeing 737-300, N397US, 
encountered turbulence after departure from General Edward Lawrence Logan International 
Airport, Boston, Massachusetts.  There was no damage to the airplane, which was owned and 
operated by US Airways as flight 6509.  There were no injuries to 4 crewmembers and 55 
passengers, while 1 crewmember was seriously injured.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed for the flight destined for Ronald Regan Washington National Airport, Washington, 
DC.  An instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the air carrier flight conducted under 14 
CFR part 121. 
The manager of Flight Safety at US Airways stated:
"The flight was dispatched with MEL No. 22-3, yaw damper inop.  After level off and during 
initial passenger service the flight began to encounter turbulence that became progressively 
worse.  The flight attendant returned the serving cart to its stowage bin and then strapped into 
her jumpseat.  During the continued turbulence the cart began to break free.  On instinct the 
flight attendant put up her foot to hold the cart; however, it pushed her foot backwards.  At 
first, the flight attendant assumed her foot was just bruised and would get better on its own, it 
did not.  She visited her own doctor who diagnosed that she had fractured the 5th metatarsal 
base of her left foot."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
