Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
AUSTIN, NV
Accident Number:
LAX00TA212
Date & Time:
06/01/2000, 0615 PDT 
Registration:
N4872A
Aircraft:
Piper PA-18-150
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Public Aircraft
Analysis 
The pilot reported that he had been monitoring an increase in the fuel burn rate over a period 
of time.  His normal leaning procedure for best power operating from 5,800 feet mean sea level 
required more mixture control travel.  On the day of the accident, it was the second time that 
the engine had failed to respond to throttle input.  The subsequent loss of engine power 
occurred low to the terrain.  Post accident examination of the carburetor revealed a black 
composite float that felt heavier than normal.  One pontoon exhibited light damage to the 
smooth shell.  The engine spark plugs were lightly fuel sooted.  According to Precision 
Airmotive Corporation "mandatory" Service Bulletin MSA-1(replacement of composite floats 
with metal floats), the type certificate holder of the carburetor, states that; "field reports 
indicate that composite floats may be absorbing fluid and sinking," replace the existing 
composite float with a metal float.  A sinking float may result in disruption of fuel flow to the 
engine, Precision Airmotive therefore considers the replacement of composite floats with metal 
floats mandatory.  Compliance is optional for 14 CFR Part 91 operators.
  
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Loss of engine power caused by a fuel soaked float pontoon causing an over rich fuel/air 
mixture, in a critical phase of flight.

Factual Information
On June 1, 2000, at 0615 hours Pacific daylight time, a PA-18-150, N4872A, collided with 
terrain while maneuvering near Austin, Nevada.  The aircraft sustained substantial damage 
and the certificated commercial pilot and his passenger received minor injuries.  The aircraft 
was being operated as a public-use flight by the United States Department of Agriculture, 
Office of Wildlife Services, when the accident occurred.  The flight originated from the Austin 
airport at 0600.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and a VFR company 
flight plan was filed.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
