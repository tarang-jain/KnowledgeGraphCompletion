Analysis   
According to the pilot, while landing following a cross-country flight the airplane touched 
down and began to bounce. The pilot attempted to recover, but the airplane bounced twice and, 
when the pilot felt that the airplane was about to stall, he initiated a missed approach. The pilot 
then flew the traffic pattern and landed again uneventfully. The pilot stated that, while taxiing 
to the parking ramp, he could not steer the airplane and that the ground guide observed that 
the nose landing gear tire was flat. An inspection of the airplane performed by a Federal 
Aviation Administration inspector revealed substantial damage to the lower firewall. The pilot 
reported that there were no mechanical problems with the airplane. A weather observation 
taken about the time of the accident recorded the wind as from 260 degrees at 12 knots, 
gusting to 16 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of aircraft control while landing with a gusting wind.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
