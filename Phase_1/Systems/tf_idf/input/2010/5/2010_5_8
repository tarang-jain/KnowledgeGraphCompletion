Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
South Bend, WA
Accident Number:
WPR10LA235
Date & Time:
05/02/2010, 1600 PDT 
Registration:
N3174V
Aircraft:
BEECH 35
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot established a higher-than-normal final approach speed due to gusting wind and 
subsequently touched down near the midpoint of the runway. Shortly after the airplane 
touched down, the pilot aborted the landing attempt and applied full engine power. The pilot 
reported that the airplane momentarily became airborne before losing engine power and 
settling back to the runway. The airplane subsequently overran the runway. 
Duringpostaccident examination the engine was started and developed power, operating 
normally between varied power settings from idle to full power. The engine could not maintain 
continuous operation and would experience a total loss of power after about one to two 
minutes. The reason for the non-continuous engine operation could not be determined. No 
other anomalies were noted during the functional test and exam.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power during takeoff for undetermined reasons, which resulted in a runway 
overrun.

Factual Information
On May 2, 2010, about 1600 Pacific daylight time, a Beech 35, N3174V, sustained substantial 
damage following a runway overrun at the Willapa Harbor Airport, South Bend (Raymond), 
Washington. The private pilot and passenger were not injured. The airplane was registered to 
Bayshore Realty and operated by the pilot as a personal flight under the provisions of 14 Code 
of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The cross-country flight departed Bremerton, 
Washington, at 1430 with a planned destination of Willapa Harbor. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed for the visual flight rules (VFR) flight.
In a written report submitted to the National Transportation Safety Board, the pilot reported 
that the winds were from the south and gusting during the approach to runway 29. He reported 
that his approach airspeed was "90" plus miles per hour (mph) on short final due to wind 
conditions. The pilot reported that the airplane floated about 10 to 15 feet above the ground 
before it touched down approximately halfway down the 3,005 foot, hard-surfaced runway. 
Shortly after the airplane touched down, the pilot aborted the landing and applied full power. 
The airplane became airborne and as it ascended through about 20 feet above ground, the 
engine lost power. The pilot reported that the airplane touched down a second time and 
subsequently overran the runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, undercarriage and firewall.
Following the accident, the airframe was disassembled and both wings were removed by 
recovery personnel to facilitate removal and storage of the airplane. On December 7, 2010, the 
engine was examined and functionally tested at AvTech Services, Kent, Washington. For the 
purposes of the test run an alternate fuel source, which consisted of an auxiliary fuel tank and 
supply fuel line, was used to deliver fuel to the engine. The supply fuel line was routed directly 
to the fuel selector valve. After numerous attempts, the engine was started and developed 
power between varied power settings from idle to full power; however, continuous operation 
for more than one to two minutes was not attained. The reason for the non-continuous engine 
operation was not determined. No additional anomalies were noted during the functional test 
and exam.  
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Approved Flight Manual for the airplane indicated 
that the recommended landing approach speed for the accident airplane was 74 miles per hour 
(mph).

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
