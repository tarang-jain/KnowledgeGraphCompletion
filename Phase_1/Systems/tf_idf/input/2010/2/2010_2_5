Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Los Banos, CA
Accident Number:
WPR10LA127
Date & Time:
02/02/2010, 1320 PST 
Registration:
N36MV
Aircraft:
HILLER UH-12E
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Powerplant sys/comp malf/fail
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot of the helicopter had just completed an aerial application flight and was returning to 
land. As he approached the landing area, he began to apply power, but the engine did not 
respond. He continued to twist the throttle, but it felt loose with no resistance and the engine 
speed did not change. He aborted the landing approach and performed a run-on landing in a 
field; during the approach the engine speed began to decrease and the helicopter landed hard, 
causing substantial damage to the tail boom and lower fuselage. Postaccident examination 
revealed that the throttle control attach fitting located in the aft section of the collective control 
had become separated. The nuts and bolts attaching the fitting were not located. The lack of 
witness marks on the throttle fitting indicates that either the attachment bolt failed or rapidly 
unscrewed from its associated nut. The disconnection resulted in a loss of engine control and 
subsequent partial loss of engine power. The last annual inspection occurred 11 months and 
250 flight hours prior to the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power due to a failure of the throttle interconnect hardware, which 
resulted in a hard landing.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On February 2, 2010, about 1320 Pacific standard time, a Hiller UH-12E helicopter, N36MV, 
landed hard near Los Banos, California. S and S Helicopters was operating the helicopter under 
the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 as an aerial application flight. 
The certificated commercial pilot was not injured. The helicopter sustained substantial 
damage. The local flight departed from a field near Los Banos. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.
The pilot reported that he had just completed an aerial application over a wheat field, and was 
returning to land. As he approached the landing area at an altitude of about 30 feet above 
ground level, he began to apply power, but the engine did not respond. He continued to twist 
the throttle, but it felt loose with no resistance, and the engine speed did not change. He 
aborted the landing approach, and turned the helicopter towards a larger open field. He circled 
the field about three times while attempting to diagnose the problem. He then elected to 
perform a run-on landing; during the landing approach, the engine speed began to decrease, 
and the helicopter landed hard.
During the landing sequence, the tailboom separated from the aft bulkhead, and the lower 
fuselage sustained crush damage. 
Post accident examination revealed that the throttle control fitting, located at the aft end of the 
collective stick assembly, had become separated from the cam lever rod bearing.
According to the Hiller service manual applicable to this helicopter, the throttle control fitting 
is connected to the cam lever rod with an AN23-16A bolt, NAS43DD3-4 spacer, AN960PD10L 
washer, and a NAS679A3 nut. None of these fittings were located on the engine deck, and 
examination of the control arm mating surfaces revealed no gouges or fretting signatures.
According to maintenance logbook entries, the helicopter underwent an annual inspection on 
February 25, 2009, at an airframe total time of 6,815 flight hours. According to the FAA 
inspector who responded to the accident, the helicopter™s total flight time at the time of the 
accident was 7,064 hours.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
