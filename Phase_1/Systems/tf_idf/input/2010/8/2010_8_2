Aviation Incident Final Report
Location:
Mount Pleasant, TX
Incident Number:
CEN10IA453
Date & Time:
08/01/2010, 1200 CDT 
Registration:
N4184X
Aircraft:
PIPER PA-32R-301T
Aircraft Damage:
None
Defining Event:
Sys/Comp malf/fail (non-power)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Positioning
Analysis 
The pilot reported that he was in level flight with the autopilot engaged when the airplane 
began an uncommanded roll. The pilot disengaged the autopilot and found that the airplane™s 
ailerons were inoperative. The pilot made a successful landing using the rudder for directional 
and roll control. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the right aileron 
primary control cable was severed where it contacted an idler pulley. That pulley would not 
rotate due to an out-of-tolerance idler pulley outer bearing that restricted the rotation of the 
pulley. It is likely that the control cable sliding against the seized pulley caused the cable to 
wear through. The airplane manufacturer issued a maintenance alert following this incident 
that highlighted the importance of proper and recurring inspections of the flight control cables 
and pulleys.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
The failure of an aileron control cable due to a seized idler pulley bearing.

Factual Information
On August 1, 2010, about 1200 central daylight time, a Piper PA-32R-301T airplane, N4184X, 
experienced a total loss of aileron control prior to landing at the Mount Pleasant Municipal 
Airport (OSA), Mount Pleasant, Texas. The airplane was not damaged and the commercial pilot 
was not injured. The positioning flight originated at Gilmer Municipal Airport (JXI), Gilmer, 
Texas, with OSA as the intended destination. The flight was being conducted under the 
provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed at the time of the incident.
The pilot reported he was level at 2,000 feet mean sea level, about 10 miles from OSA, when 
the airplane started an un-commanded left roll. He disengaged the autopilot and discovered 
the ailerons were not responding. The pilot landed successfully at OSA using the rudder to 
control the airplane.
The airplane aileron control system included two control cables routed to each wing; the 
primary cable and the balance cable. A postaccident examination by the operator revealed the 
right wing (RW) primary cable was completely severed 13 inches from the threaded end of the 
cable, roughly located adjacent to an idler pulley. The pulley could not be rotated when 
manipulated. Additional wear spots, indicated by polishing and/or fraying were annotated at 
additional locations on the RW primary cable, the RW balance cable, and left wing (LW) 
primary and balance cables. The RW primary cable had a dark grease like material covering the 
failure area. A similar substance was found on the idler pulley. An additional idler pulley for 
the RW balance cable was found that initially did not rotate when manipulated. The person 
manipulating the idler pulley twisted it firmly and heard a ﬁclick.ﬂ The pulley turned freely 
following the click.
Inspectors from the Federal Aviation Administration examined the airplane and components 
on August 5, 2010. They stated the idler pulley at the location of the cable failure appeared to 
have a manufacturing flaw, in that it was not machined completely through, which created a 
ﬁlipﬂ that did not allow the bushing to go completely through the idler pulley.
The suspect RW primary cable idler pulley and portions of the broken RW primary cable were 
sent to the manufacturer for examination. The inside diameter of the idler pulley outer bearing 
was found to measure .0065 inches less than the service limit for the component. The 
submitted portion of the primary cable was found to be manufactured from galvanized steel.
Piper Aircraft, Inc. issued Service Letter No. 1135 as a maintenance alert on October 19, 2010. 
The alert emphasized the critical nature of control cable and pulley inspections, and 
highlighted the recurring inspection requirements.  It included instructions for inspections of 
control cables and pulleys.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
