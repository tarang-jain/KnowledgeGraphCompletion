Analysis   
According to the pilot, he performed a run-up and proceeded to the departure end of the 
runway. He applied full power and began the takeoff roll. With the airplane about halfway 
down the runway, the pilot realized that the airplane was not developing as much airspeed as 
he expected. As the airplane approached the end of the runway, he decided to abort the takeoff. 
He pulled back the throttle and applied the brakes but the airplane did not slow down quickly 
enough. The airplane ran off the end of the runway, traveled down an embankment, and came 
to rest in a marshy area, substantially damaging the forward section of the fuselage. The pilot 
noted that he had forgotten to set the flaps properly for takeoff. During a postaccident 
examination of the wreckage, a Federal Aviation Administration inspector found no preexisting 
mechanical anomalies with the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
