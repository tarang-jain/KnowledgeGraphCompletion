Analysis   
According to the certified flight instructor, the student pilot was on approach for landing to 
runway 10 left. Prior to touchdown the student pilot pulled excessive back pressure on the 
elevator flight control and the airplane ballooned before touching down hard on the main 
landing gear. The flight instructor then took over the flight controls, made a go-around, and 
landed on another runway. The airplane received substantial damage to the rudder torque 
tube.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=75645
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
