01/01/2010, 1930 CST 
Registration:
N2028U

MAULE M-4-220C

Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
While on a night cross-country flight the pilot experienced problems with the airplane™s global 
positioning system (GPS) and elected to land to recharge the battery. Once airborne the pilot 
again experienced problems with the GPS and received vectors to his destination airport. While 
in the vicinity of the destination airport, the pilot was unable to activate the airport™s runway 
lights or to see the airport beacon. The pilot then selected an alternate airport located 45 miles 
away; however, while en route the airplane™s fuel supply was exhausted and the airplane 
experienced a complete loss of engine power. During the ensuing forced landing the main 
landing gear collapsed and the airplane came to rest upright in a ditch. The pilot and 
passengers were able to exit unassisted. A review of flight planning publications for the 
destination airport revealed that the rotating beacon was listed as out of service and that a 
frequency other than the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency was needed to activate the 
runway lights. In addition, Federal Aviation Regulations require a pilot flying at night to have 
enough fuel to arrive at the intended destination plus an additional 45 minutes worth of fuel.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion as a result of the pilot™s inadequate preflight 
planning.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=75225
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
