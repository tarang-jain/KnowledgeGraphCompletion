Analysis   
Just after the airplane lifted off the runway surface during the night takeoff, the pilot observed 
two deer crossing the runway from left to right. He stated that one deer was in front of him and 
the other was to the left of his path. He pulled back on the yoke in an attempt to avoid the deer 
at which time he heard a loud "bang." The pilot reported that he missed the deer that he 
observed and contacted a third deer that he did not see. The pilot continued the flight to his 
destination where he made an uneventful landing. The injured deer was located at the 
departure airport. The right horizontal stabilizer and elevator sustained substantial damage.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
