Location:
Wabash, IN
Accident Number:
CEN11CA004
Date & Time:
10/01/2010, 1830 EDT 
Registration:
N2140E
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172N
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Landing area overshoot
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The certificated flight instructor (CFI) and student had been practicing touch-and-go landings 
and were planning a full-stop landing. The airplane touched down on the grass airstrip slightly 
faster than normal and approximately 100 feet beyond the approach end of the runway. The 
CFI took authority of the airplane's controls and applied brakes. As the airplane approached 
the end of the runway, the CFI applied left rudder to avoid a ditch in front of the airplane. 
Subsequently, the right main landing gear went into the ditch and the airplane flipped over. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the vertical stabilizer and rudder were 
bent. The CFI reported that there were no preimpact mechanical anomalies with the airplane. 
He further stated that they should have landed on the adjacent asphalt runway or performed a 
go-around after overshooting the final approach leg during the landing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain proper airspeed during the landing and certificated 
flight instructor's failure to execute a go-around.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=77493
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
