Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
St. Johns, MI
Accident Number:
CEN11CA003
Date & Time:
10/01/2010, 1016 EDT 
Registration:
N3051L
Aircraft:
CESSNA 310J
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Collision with terr/obj (non-CFIT)
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that the flight was normal and he maneuvered the multi-engine airplane 
onto the final approach leg of the traffic pattern. The airplane yawed slightly to the right and 
the pilot attempted a go-around at about 100 feet above ground level. He noted that there was 
a lack of engine power from the right engine. The pilot arrested the descent with power from 
the left engine, but the airplane impacted terrain adjacent to the runway. A postaccident 
examination of the right engine was limited to verifying engine compression, which was 
confirmed to be normal.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure by the pilot to attain/maintain a climb rate for undetermined reasons during a go-
around.
Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
