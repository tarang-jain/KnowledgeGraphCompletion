Analysis   
The pilot departed on his third aerial application flight for the day.  Shortly after take-off, the 
engine lost power and the pilot elected to conduct a forced landing in a field.  During 
touchdown, the airplane landed hard and received substantial damage. After the accident, the 
pilot reported that this was the first flight since refueling the airplane. The pilot also added that 
he did not check the fuel supply, prior to refueling the airplane. An examination of the airplane 
and refueling tanks, after the accident, revealed water was present in the fuel.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s inadequate preflight inspection and failure to detect water contaminated fuel, which 
resulted in a loss of engine power during takeoff.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
