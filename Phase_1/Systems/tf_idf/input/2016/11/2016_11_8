Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
According to the pilot of the twin-engine airplane, he descended from 7,000 ft and leveled off 
at 3,000 ft. After leveling off, the fuel quantity indicators fluctuated then showed empty. He 
recalled that, about 5 minutes after leveling off, the right engine began to run very roughly, so 
he enriched the right engine's mixture and activated the auxiliary fuel pump. He added that, 
subsequently, "the right engine failed and the left engine simultaneously began losing power." 
The pilot declared an emergency with air traffic control, began receiving vectors, and the left 
engine lost power.
The pilot pitched the airplane for best glide distance. He selected the nearest suitable landing 
area, extended the landing gear and flaps, and landed the airplane in a field. During the 
landing roll, he turned the airplane to the right to avoid a collision with obstacles, and the nose 
landing gear bounced several times and separated from the airplane. The airplane sustained 
substantial damage to the fuselage bulkheads, longerons, and stringers. 
The pilot believed that, due to his failure to visually check the fuel level, he overestimated the 
amount of fuel on board. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to ensure that adequate fuel was onboard for the flight, which resulted in fuel 
exhaustion and the loss of engine power.

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=94347
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
