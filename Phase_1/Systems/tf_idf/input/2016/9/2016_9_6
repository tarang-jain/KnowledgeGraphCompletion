On September 2, 2016, about 0945 Hawaii Standard Time, a McDonnell Douglas 500N 
helicopter, N5232G, was in an initial climb after rescuing a hiker and firefighter from the 
Diamond Head state trail in Honolulu, Hawaii, when the firefighter fell from the rescue net. 
Two crew members and one passenger were uninjured, and one crew member sustained 
serious injuries. The helicopter sustained no damage. The helicopter was registered to, and 
operated by the City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii, as a public use flight operated under 14 
Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed about the time 
of the accident, and no flight plan was filed. The local flight originated from the Honolulu 
International Airport (HNL) about 0935. 
The operator reported that the pilot flew the helicopter from the airport to pick up an injured 
hiker and a firefighter from a nearby trail. A net that was attached to an approximate 75 foot 
line was lowered, and the hiker and firefighter climbed in. As the helicopter was flying away 
from the site, the firefighter fell from the net and impacted the ground about 25 feet below. 
Video evidence revealed the net struck a pole just prior to the firefighter falling from the net.
