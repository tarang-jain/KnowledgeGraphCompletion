Location:
Lawrence, KS
Accident Number:
GAA17CA008
Date & Time:
10/01/2016, 1330 CDT 
Registration:
N4836J
Aircraft:
BEECH 35
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Collision during takeoff/land
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The flight instructor reported that he was conducting primary flight training in a complex, 
high-performance airplane. On final approach during daylight hours, the runway's precision 
approach path indicator (PAPI) indicated the airplane was low on the approach path. He 
advised the student pilot to reduce the rate of descent. He further reported that the student 
pilot "relaxed his white knuckle grip" and the airplane pitched down "significantly". The flight 
instructor grabbed the control yoke and applied full throttle, but the airplane struck the 
runway approach lights during the low altitude recovery. The flight instructor landed the 
airplane without further incident. 
A postaccident examination of the airplane, by the flight instructor, revealed the airplane was 
trimmed nose down and that the right wing had sustained substantial damage.
The flight instructor reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's delayed remedial action, which resulted in an unstabilized approach and 
collision with runway approach lights.

Note:

to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=94160
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
