Accident Number:
GAA17CA001
Date & Time:
10/01/2016, 1346 AKD 
Registration:
N8922
Aircraft:

Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
According to the pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane, during the approach, he applied 
carburetor heat, set airspeed to 70 knots, and set the flaps to 1 notch less than full. He reported 
that the flare and touchdown on the gravel runway was "very smooth." However, he recalled 
that, when the tailwheel contacted the ground, the right wing ascended, and the left wing 
dragged across the ground. The pilot reported that the left wing strut failed and that the 
airplane nosed over and came to rest on the gravel runway. Additionally, the pilot noted that, 
after the accident, the wind sock indicated a direct crosswind from the right and varied 
between three-quarters to completely full.
However, postaccident photographs of the airplane revealed that the airplane's left wing 
sustained damage to its top side. The bottom side of the left wing, the wing tip, and the wing 
strut revealed no indication of runway contact. The photographs revealed substantial damage 
to the horizontal stabilizer and the rudder.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper crosswind correction, which resulted in a loss of pitch control and nose-
over.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
