Aviation Accident Preliminary Report
Location:
Hurley, MS
Accident Number:
ERA16LA145
Date & Time:
04/02/2016, 1707 CDT 
Registration:
N8115T
Aircraft:
CESSNA 175B
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On April 2, 2016, about 1707 central daylight time, a Cessna 175B, N8115T, was substantially 
damaged during a forced landing to a field near Hurley, Mississippi. The commercial pilot, the 
sole occupant was not injured. The flight was operated by a private individual under the 
provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed. The flight originated about 7 
minutes earlier from Mobile Regional Airport (MOB), Mobile, Alabama, and was destined for 
Slidell Airport (ASD), Slidell, Louisiana.
The pilot noted no discrepancies during his preflight inspection or engine-run up. After takeoff, 
while in contact with air traffic control, the pilot climbed to between 1,200 and 1,500 feet mean 
sea level (msl) and after levelling off, he slowly leaned the fuel to air ratio. After moving the 
mixture control about 1/4 to 1/2 inch, the engine rpm "abruptly" decreased from 2,900 to 
1,200. He promptly pushed the mixture control full-in, but that action did not restore engine 
power. He twice advanced the throttle fully forward, and the engine power briefly increased, 
before again falling back to idle. As the airplane descended below 1,000 feet msl, he informed 
air traffic control of the situation and was vectored to a nearby private airport.
With insufficient altitude available to glide to the airport, he maneuvered the airplane for a 
forced landing to a field. During the landing roll the nose landing contacted the upslope of a 
ditch, separating it from the airplane. The airplane then slid about 100 feet, coming to rest 
upright in a nose-low/tail-high attitude. The pilot then exited the airplane, provided his 
mechanic the location coordinates, and rescue services were dispatched. The pilot was taken to 
a nearby hospital where he released with no injuries later the same evening.
Preliminary examination of the airplane revealed adequate, uncontaminated fuel in the fuel 
tanks, fuel strainer, and carburetor bowl. The mixture control in the cockpit was in the full rich 
position but the mixture control lever at the carburetor was in the idle cut-off position.
