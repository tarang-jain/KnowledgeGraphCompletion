Analysis   
The pilot reported while practicing take offs and landings, he made a standard approach and 
landing to runway 35. On takeoff, he reduced the flaps to zero degrees and he reported that the 
airplane was under control and over the runway centerline. After he applied full power and 
right rudder before lifting off the ground, the airplane started turning to the left sharply. He 
applied additional right rudder, he reduced the power, and applied full brakes. The airplane 
departed the runway to left into a swamp and nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial 
damage to the right wing and the firewall.
The pilot verified that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported that the wind velocity at the accident site was 6 to 7 knots and the wind 
direction was 330 degrees. The weather reporting facility at the accident site reported that 
about 3 minutes after the accident time that the wind velocity was 7 knots and the wind 
direction was 310 degrees.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the takeoff, resulting in a runway 
excursion and a nose over.
Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
