Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that, while on a cross-country flight, he diverted from his destination to a 
nearby airport due to low fuel. He added that the right fuel tank "went dry" and that the engine 
lost power on downwind, so he switched to the left fuel tank, and the engine momentarily 
restarted before it experienced a total power loss of power on base. Subsequently, the airplane 
impacted the instrument landing system lights, which resulted in substantial damage to both 
wings.
The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation. He reported that he miscalculated the fuel and "ran 
out of gas." A postaccident examination found about 1 cup of fuel in one of the tanks.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper preflight planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and the total loss of 
engine power.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
