Analysis   
The helicopter pilot reported that while flying about 300 feet above a ridge with an elevation of 
4,900 feet at 10 miles per hour (8.68 knots), he could not hear very well in his headset and 
needed to adjust the volume. He reported that he removed his left hand from the collective and 
used it to hold the cyclic so he could use his right hand to adjust the volume on his headset. 
During this process, he reported that he forgot to increase the friction on the collective prior to 
removing his left hand. He further reported that the collective "dropped which decreased main 
rotor pitch causing the engine to overspeed." 
The pilot reported that the helicopter started to spin to the right; he grabbed the collective, 
reduced throttle, and then increased the collective pitch. He reported that the helicopter 
"experienced settling with power," and spun around 8 to 10 times. He further reported that the 
helicopter landed hard at the top of a ridge and rolled onto its right side. The helicopter 
sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, main rotor system, tailboom, and tail rotor 
system. 
The pilot verified that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
As a safety recommendation, the pilot stated he "should have increased the collective friction 
prior to removing his left hand from the collective stick." He also stated that "the problem was 
made worse because the helicopter was only 300 feet above ground level at 10 miles per hour 
[8.68 knots]." 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has published FAA-H-8083-21 Helicopter Flying 
Handbook (2012). This handbook discusses the function of the collective and states in part:
"An adjustable friction control helps prevent inadvertent collective pitch movement." 
This handbook also discusses recovery from a settling with power condition and states in part: 
"When recovering from a settling with power condition, the pilot tends first to try to stop the 
Page 2 of 4GAA16CA143
descent by increasing collective pitch. However, this only results in increasing the stalled area 
of the rotor, thereby increasing the rate of descent. Since inboard portions of the blades are 
stalled, cyclic control may be limited. Recovery is accomplished by increasing airspeed, and/or 
partially lowering collective pitch. In many helicopters, lateral cyclic combined with lateral tail 
rotor thrust will produce the quickest exit from the hazard assuming that there are no barriers 
in that direction. In a fully developed vortex ring state, the only recovery may be to enter 
autorotation to break the vortex ring state."
The pilot reported that he utilized a 4-point restraint system installed in the helicopter and 
sustained minor injuries. He also reported that "I credit the shoulder harness restraint with 
keeping my injuries from being far worse."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to set the appropriate collective friction prior to releasing the collective in 
flight, which resulted in decreased main rotor pitch, settling with power, and an impact with 
terrain.

Note:

to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=92800
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
