Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot of the tailwheel equipped airplane reported that during the landing roll in gusty wind 
conditions, the airplane veered off the runway to the left, despite him "standing" on the right 
brake with full right rudder applied.  The pilot further reported that he did not apply enough 
back pressure to enable the tailwheel steering to lock. The airplane ground looped, and slid into 
a fence. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. 
According to the pilot there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain direction control during the landing roll, which resulted in 
runway excursion, and collision with a fence.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
