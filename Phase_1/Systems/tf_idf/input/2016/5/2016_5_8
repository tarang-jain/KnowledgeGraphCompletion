Accident Number:
GAA16CA213
Date & Time:
05/03/2016, 1720 PDT 
Registration:
N227SH
Aircraft:
ROBINSON HELICOPTER R22
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:

Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The flight instructor reported that he was practicing hover flight in a helicopter over soft grass 
at a height of 5 to 7 feet above the ground with a student pilot on his second training flight. The 
flight instructor further reported that he was controlling the collective and anti-torque pedals, 
and the student pilot was controlling the cyclic control. During the hover, the flight instructor 
reported that he became fixated on the manifold pressure gauge and did not notice that the 
helicopter was moving forward and descending. Subsequently, the helicopter's right skid 
impacted the ground and rolled over.    
The main rotor drive shaft and tailboom were substantially damaged. 
The flight instructor did not report any mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's failure to monitor outside the helicopter during hover flight, which 
resulted in a collision with terrain and rollover.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=93100
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
