Analysis   
The pilot reported that he bounced once during the landing touchdown in crosswind 
conditions, and subsequently ground looped to the left. During the ground loop, the right main 
landing gear collapsed and the right wing was substantially damaged when it impacted the 
runway.  
An automated weather observing system, about the time of the accident, reported the wind at 
080 degrees true at 14 knots, for the landing on runway 17 left.  
The pilot did not report any mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll in crosswind 
conditions, which resulted in a ground loop and substantial damage to the right wing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
