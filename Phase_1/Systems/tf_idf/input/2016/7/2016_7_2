Registration:
N4916B

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The pilot was taking his private pilot checkride and was demonstrating a short-field landing. 
During the landing, the wind was gusting, and he decided to go around. During the go-around, 
the left wing dropped and struck the runway. The designated pilot examiner (DPE) took 
control of the airplane and completed the go-around. He then returned control of the airplane 
to the pilot, and the pilot then performed another short-field landing with a full stop. After the 
full-stop landing, he taxied to the fixed-base operator (FBO) at the airport, and he and the DPE 
exited the airplane and went into the FBO to complete the paperwork for the check ride. After 
the DPE had completed the paperwork, the pilot returned to the airplane intending to fly back 
to his home airport. During his preflight inspection, he noticed that the wing was damaged. 
Examination of the wing revealed that both wing spars were substantially damaged.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to compensate for the gusting wind conditions during a short-field landing 
and the designated pilot examiner's delayed remedial action, which resulted in the wing tip 
contacting the runway during the go-around.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=93905
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
