Location:
Cullman, AL
Accident Number:
GAA16CA363
Date & Time:
07/01/2016, 1510 CDT 
Registration:
N9658F
Aircraft:
HUGHES 269C
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Abnormal runway contact
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The helicopter flight instructor reported that the commercial pilot rated/helicopter flight 
instructor candidate receiving instruction was practicing autorotations with power recovery to 
the runway; during a practice 180 degree autorotation, the flight instructor candidate executed 
the landing flare too low to the ground resulting in a tail rotor strike. The flight instructor 
further reported that he took the controls and landed the helicopter after it had yawed, un-
commanded to the right, about 180 degrees.  
The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the vertical stabilizer and tail rotor drive 
assembly.
The flight instructor reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or 
malfunctions with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.  
The FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook FAA-H-8083-21A (2012) discusses procedures for 
autorotation and states in part:
Care must be taken in the execution of the flare so that the cyclic control is neither moved 
rearward so abruptly that it causes the helicopter to climb nor moved so slowly that it does not 
arrest the descent, which may allow the helicopter to settle so rapidly that the tail rotor strikes 
the ground– extreme caution should be used to avoid an excessive nose high and tail low 
attitude below 10 feet. The helicopter must be close to the landing attitude to keep the tail rotor 
from contacting the surface.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The helicopter flight instructor candidate's improper execution of the autorotation, resulting in 
abnormal ground contact and subsequent damage to the vertical stabilizer and tail rotor drive 
assembly.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=93552
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
