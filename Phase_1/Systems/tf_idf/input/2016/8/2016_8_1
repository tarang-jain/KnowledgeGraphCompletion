GAA16CA407
Date & Time:
08/01/2016, 1600 PDT 
Registration:
N49276
Aircraft:
CESSNA 152
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Abnormal runway contact
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The solo student pilot reported that during the third landing of his first solo, the airplane was a 
"little high" on final approach. He further reported that during the landing flare, the right wing 
was lifted by a crosswind and the airplane bounced nose wheel first on the runway. 
Subsequently, the nose wheel partially collapsed, the propeller struck the runway, and the 
airplane skidded to a stop on the runway.
The firewall sustained substantial damage.
The student pilot did not report any mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation. 
The automated weather observing system (AWOS) at the airport about 7 minutes before the 
accident recorded the wind at 020 degrees true at 11 knots, gusting to 15 knots. The AWOS at 
the airport about 53 minutes after the accident recorded the wind at 330 degrees true at 8 
knots. The student pilot reported that the landing was on runway 33.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain pitch control during the landing flare in gusty crosswind 
conditions, which resulted in a hard landing/abnormal runway contact, a partial nose wheel 
collapse and substantial damage to the firewall.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
