Santa Paula, CA
Accident Number:
WPR15FA227
Date & Time:
08/01/2015, 0905 PDT 
Registration:
N4CU
Aircraft:
CESSNA P337G
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Controlled flight into terr/obj 
(CFIT)
Injuries:
1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The noninstrument-rated commercial pilot departed for the cross-country flight over 
mountainous terrain in instrument meteorological conditions. A witness observed the airplane 
take off from runway 22, disappear into an overcast layer at 300 ft above ground level (about 
550 ft mean sea level [msl]), and then reappear heading in the opposite direction. The witness 
reported that the airplane departed the traffic pattern heading northeast. The wreckage was 
located in mountainous terrain at an elevation of 1,223 ft msl, 2.8 mi east of the departure 
airport. Meteorological data indicated that, at the time of the accident, a cloud layer extended 
over the accident site from about 550 ft msl to about 2,100 ft msl, and, at the elevation of the 
accident site, the terrain would have been obscured by clouds. Examination of the wreckage did 
not reveal evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have 
precluded normal operation of the airframe or engine. The orientation of the wreckage 
indicated that, at impact, the airplane was heading south and traveling at a ground speed 
consistent with normal traffic pattern speeds. The damage to the airplane was consistent with 
controlled flight into the terrain, and the airplane's impact heading was consistent with the 
pilot attempting to return to the airport when the airplane collided with the rising terrain.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The noninstrument-rated pilot's decision to conduct a visual flight in instrument 
meteorological conditions, which resulted in controlled flight into mountainous terrain.

Controlled flight into terr/obj (CFIT) (Defining event)
On August 1, 2015, about 0905 Pacific daylight time, a Cessna P337G, N4CU, impacted 
mountainous terrain about 2.8 miles east of Santa Paula Airport, Santa Paula, California. The 
commercial pilot was fatally injured and the airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane 
was registered to the pilot and operated under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations, Part 91. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight and no 
flight plan had been filed. The flight originated at Santa Paula Airport and was destined for 
California City, California.
Airplane wreckage was located by California Resources Corporation employee who was 
working at the South Mountain Booster Plant. He located the wreckage about 1400 PDT on 
August 1. A witness reported seeing the airplane takeoff at 0902 from runway 22 at Santa Paula 
Airport. The airplane disappeared into a 300 foot above ground level (agl) overcast then 
reemerged after turning 180 degrees on a close downwind to the runway. It then departed on 
the downwind to the east.
The wreckage was located on the north side of South Mountain on a 40 degree slope populated 
with scrub trees at an elevation of 1,223 feet mean sea level (msl), 2.8 miles east of the 
departure airport. The initial point of impact was the left wingtip identified by wingtip fairing 
fragments and topped-off small trees/brush next to the main impact ground scar. Contained 
within the ground scar was the landing gear door. Clipped brush and ground scar evidence is 
consistent with a level attitude at time of impact. The airplane traveled upslope 20-30 feet 
beyond the initial impact point, along a 205° magnetic bearing direction.

The six-seat, high-wing, twin engine, retractable landing gear airplane, serial number 
P3370065, was manufactured in 1973. It was powered by a Rolls Royce TSIO-360D in the 
front, and a Continental Motors TSIO-360C(5B) in the rear, both capable of producing 225 
horsepower. Both engines were equipped with McCaulley constant speed, two bladed, 
propellers. A review of the airplane's maintenance logbooks showed that an annual inspection 
was performed on July 31, 2014. At the time of the inspection the documented total time on the 
airframe was 2,246.7 hours. The front engine logbook documented that a 100 hour inspection 
had been completed on July 31, 2015, time since overhaul (TSOH) of 921.7 hours. The rear 
engine logbook showed that a 100 hour inspection had been completed on July 31, 2015, at 
1,403.0 hours TSOH. Both engine inspections were signed by the pilot, who held a mechanic 
airframe and powerplant certificate. Family members of the pilot stated that the intention of 
the flight was to travel to California City, California, where a mechanic was going to finish the 
annual inspection.

The nearest weather reporting station was Camarillo Airport, located about 10 miles southwest 
of the accident site. At 0855 the automatic surface observation system (ASOS) recorded calm 
wind, 5 statute mile visibility in haze, a 700 foot agl overcast, temperature was 21 degrees 
Celsius, the dew point was 18 degrees Celsius, and the atmospheric pressure was 29.99 inches 
of mercury. The GOES-15 satellite visible image at 0900 depicts an area of low stratiform 
clouds and/or fog over the accident site and the departure airport, and generally hugging the 
California coastal sections. The San Diego upper air sounding plot supports cloud or stratus 
layer with tops to only 2,000 feet agl with a defined temperature inversion from 2,000 to 
4,000 feet, stable atmosphere and light winds. The radiative cloud top temperature over the 
accident site was 292° Kelvin or 18.8° Celsius (C), which corresponded to cloud tops at 2,152 ft 
msl.
WRECKAGE & IMPACT INFORMATION
The wreckage was located on a 40° slope upright with the wings and tail sections intact, on a 
137° magnetic bearing, and 20-30 foot ground scar oriented along 205°. The wings had 
separated at the wing roots but remained next to their approximate location along the fuselage. 
The forward firewall was displaced aft into the cockpit instrument panel and the cockpit floor 
was displaced upward into the cabin. The left tail boom remained attached to the left wing and 
extended aft. The stabilizer and elevator remained attached to the tail booms. Both vertical fins 
and rudders remained attached to the tailbooms. The forward engine was displaced down and 
to the left, the propeller had separated from the crank shaft behind the propeller flange. The aft 
engine remained attached to the aft engine mount and was displaced to the right. The propeller 
remained attached to the engine.

All flight control surfaces were present, and the flight control cables were traced and found 
continuous. Fuel was confirmed present in the left wing fuel tank and in each of the engine 
distribution valves. Both engine crankshafts were rotated manually and thumb compression 
achieved on all cylinders. Both propellers exhibited leading edge damage and blade tip damage 
consistent with power application.
MEDICAL & PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
An autopsy was performed on the pilot by the Ventura County Medical Examiner-Coroner, 
Ventura, California, on August 3, 2015. The cause of death was listed as "blunt force trauma."
The Federal Aviation Administration's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI), Forensic 
Toxicology Research Team performed toxicology on specimens from the pilot with negative 
results for ethanol and listed drugs. Tests for carbon monoxide and cyanide was not 
performed.

Note:
The NTSB traveled to the scene of this accident.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=91687
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
