Analysis   
The pilot reported that while departing in a tailwheel-equipped airplane, from a rough and 
uneven tundra-covered off-airport site, it failed to gain sufficient airspeed, and he aborted the 
takeoff. The airplane's main wheels sunk into the soft tundra-covered terrain, and the airplane 
subsequently nosed over, sustaining substantial damage to the wings. The pilot stated that 
there were no preaccident mechanical anomalies with the airplane that would have precluded 
normal operation.

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=92464
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
