Loss of control on ground

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
During an instructional flight in a tailwheel equipped airplane, the student pilot and flight 
instructor planned to stay in the traffic pattern for touch and go landing practice. During the 
landing rollout, the airplane started drifting to the left side of the runway. Subsequently, the 
student pilot applied a hard correction to the right with the rudder pedals and the airplane 
ground looped, stopping 180 degrees from the landing direction. The flight instructor stated 
that he called for "my aircraft" when the student pilot made the hard correction, but the 
student pilot did not get off rudder pedals. Both the student pilot and flight instructor 
suspected that inadvertent brake application may have been applied in the heel brake equipped 
airplane. The flight instructor added that he did not observe any preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions with the airplane and the winds were light during the time of the accident. 
Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed 
substantial damage to the left wing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control while landing and the flight 
instructor's delayed remedial action, which resulted in a ground-loop and the left wing 
dragging the runway.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Student pilot (Cause)
Delayed action - Instructor/check pilot (Cause)

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=90842
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
