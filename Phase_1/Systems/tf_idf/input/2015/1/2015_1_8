Fresno, CA
Accident Number:
WPR15LA077
Date & Time:
01/03/2015, 1650 PST 
Registration:
N2948U
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172D
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, about 3 miles from the destination airport, the engine experienced a 
loss of power. During the forced landing to a nearby field, the airplane collided with an unseen 
set of power lines before touching down in the field. Both the left wing and the empennage 
were substantially damaged. The pilot reported that, when the engine lost power, the left wing 
fuel gauge was indicating that the tank was empty and the right wing fuel gauge was indicating 
that the tank was 1/4 to 1/2 full of fuel. Postaccident examination of the airframe revealed that 
the fuel system was not compromised, and no evidence of fuel was found in the airplane's fuel 
system. The examination of the engine revealed no mechanical malfunctions or failures that 
would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper fuel planning, which resulted in a loss of engine power due to fuel 
exhaustion.
Findings

Fuel - Fluid level (Cause)
Fuel quantity indicator - Not specified

Factual Information
On January 3, 2015, about 1650 Pacific standard time, a Cessna 172D, N2948U, experienced a 
partial loss of engine power and collided with a power line during a forced landing near Fresno 
Chandler Municipal Airport, Fresno, California.  The private pilot and a passenger were not 
injured; the airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and the tail section.  The 
airplane was registered to an individual and operated by the pilot under the provision of 14 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 as a personal flight.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed for the flight, and no flight plan had been filed.  The flight originated from 
Oceano County Airport, Oceano, California at 1600. 
The pilot reported that he had flown from Fresno earlier in the day and was on the return trip 
back from Oceano. About 40 minutes after takeoff, the pilot began the descent toward Fresno 
Chandler Municipal Airport. During the descent, with the airplane about 3 miles from the 
runway, the engine experienced a partial loss of power. In response, the pilot set the mixture 
control to the full rich position and applied carburetor heat. Despite his attempts, the engine 
power dropped to idle. The engine would momentarily regain power when the pilot 
manipulated the throttle lever, but the airplane could not maintain altitude. The pilot made a 
forced landing in a nearby open field. The airplane subsequently impacted an unseen set of 
power lines before landing in the field. The empennage and the left wing sustained substantial 
damage.
The pilot stated that at the time of the accident, the fuel gauge in the cockpit indicated that the 
left wing fuel tank was empty, but the right wing fuel tank had between 1/4 and 1/2 of the fuel 
quantity in it.
A post accident examination by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector was 
conducted on the engine and the fuel system. Inspection of the fuel strainer revealed no signs 
of fuel. The main fuel line from the fuel strainer to the carburetor was removed, and no fuel 
was evident.  Both fuel tanks were inspected and no fuel was found.
Examination of the carburetor by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
investigator revealed that the carburetor was intact and undamaged.  The throttle control arm 
was intact and moved from stop to stop by hand.  The carburetor was disassembled and 
examined internally.  The accelerator pump functioned normally when the throttle arm was 
actuated by hand.  The metal floats were intact and undamaged.  The needle valve and needle 
valve seat were intact and undamaged.  The carburetor float bowl was free of debris.  No 
residual debris was found within the float bowl.  No debris was observed within the carburetor 
mixture metering sleeve.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
