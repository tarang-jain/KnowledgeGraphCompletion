Analysis   
On May 1, 2015 at 11:07 Mountain Daylight Time (MDT), a Titan Solara 50 solar-powered 
unmanned experimental aircraft registration N950TA crashed shortly after takeoff, near Otto, 
New Mexico.  The aircraft was operated as a scaled, proof of concept test flight.  The aircraft 
was destroyed, there were no injuries.
According to the operator, at 11:02:43 the aircraft began a controlled winch tow and rolled on 
the ground until liftoff.  After the tow release at approximately 30 ft above ground level (AGL), 
the pilot transitioned to flying the aircraft via instruments and the aircraft was powered up to 
full throttle for a straight ahead climb.  The pilot immediately recognized that the instruments 
were exhibiting complicating latency and focused on flying the aircraft to a safe altitude and 
position where the external pilot (copilot) could take control and visually land the aircraft.
The pilot initiated a left hand turn when the aircraft reached approximately 160 feet AGL, 
which continued until the aircraft reached approximately 385 feet AGL.   During this time the 
pilot made two power reductions, attempting to stabilize the aircraft at an altitude and heading 
acceptable for handover to the copilot to conduct an external visual landing.  Handover of 
controls to the copilot was not attempted during the flight.
The operator indicated that the aircraft then encountered significant thermal air mass activity 
and began to both climb and exceed its design airspeed for an extended period of time.  Visible 
deformation of the wing structure was witnessed by ground personnel during the overspeed 
condition.  It achieved a maximum altitude of approximately 520 feet AGL just prior to 
structural failure of the left outboard wing.  These thermal events were not immediately 
evident to the pilot due to latency of the aircraft instruments.  It is believed the subsequent 
wing deformation caused the aircraft to begin an uncontrollable right hand turn that the pilot 
was unable to arrest.
Coincident with the significant wing deformation, the aircraft began an uncontrollable and 
erratic flight path roughly straight ahead in a rapid descent.  The left outboard wing section 
separated from the aircraft during the first portion of the descent and the right outboard wing

section separated later in the descent.  The aircraft impacted the ground at 11:06:59 with the 
majority of the structure intact and in a nose down attitude.  There were no meteorological 
indicators that clearly showed evidence of significant pre-launch thermal activity in the test 
flight area.
The aircraft was destroyed when it struck the ground in a rural unpopulated area.  Local terrain 
surrounding the takeoff area, intended landing area (same as takeoff location), and accident 
site consisted of flat desert grassland.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
structural failure of the left wing due to an overspeed condition.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=91125
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
