Analysis   
The pilot reported that after he dropped his passenger off on a road, he departed to the east in 
smoky and hazy conditions. Shortly after takeoff, the helicopter impacted power transmission 
line wires that ran across the road. The helicopter then impacted the ground and skidded to a 
stop.  
The pilot reported there were no pre-impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. The helicopter sustained 
substantial damage to the main rotors, upper arm, and fork assembly.
Probable Cause and Findings

The pilot's failure to monitor the flight environment for adequate terrain/obstacle clearance 
during takeoff, which resulted in the inflight collision with power transmission line wires.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=91612
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
