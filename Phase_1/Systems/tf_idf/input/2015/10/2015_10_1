Analysis   
On October 1, 2015, at about 1118 eastern daylight time, American Airlines flight 982, an 
Airbus 319-100, N9026C, encountered turbulence for about 15 seconds during cruise while 
enroute from Maurice Bishop International Airport (TGPY), St. George's, Grenada, to Miami 
International Airport (KMIA), Miami, Florida. Two passengers were seriously injured, three 
passengers and one flight attendant received minor injuries, and the airplane was not 
damaged. The flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 121 as a regularly scheduled 
international passenger flight from TGPY to KMIA.
According to the operator, the seat belt sign was on and onboard radar was being utilized by 
the flight crew when the turbulence was encountered during cruise at Flight Level 360 in 
instrument meteorological conditions. After being informed of the possible injuries to the 
passengers and crew, the flight crew declared an emergency and subsequently landed at KMIA 
without further incident. Paramedics met the flight upon arrival at the gate and transported 
two passengers and one flight attendant to the hospital. The flight attendant was diagnosed 
with a minor injury and released. One passenger was diagnosed with a cervical spine fracture 
and the other passenger was diagnosed with a cracked rib and possible cracked vertebra.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=92107
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
