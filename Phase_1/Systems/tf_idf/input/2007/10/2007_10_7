Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot of the Piper PA-28-180 had been flying for about 3 hours 35 minutes when the engine 
lost power due to fuel exhaustion, and he performed a forced landing to trees.  The airplane 
impacted 50-foot tall trees prior to striking the ground.  The pilot reported that he had topped-
off the airplane's fuel tanks, which had a total capacity of 44 gallons of usable fuel prior to the 
flight.  He leaned the fuel mixture during the flight, and expected the airplane to have an 
endurance of 4.6 hours.  Examination of the wreckage and accident site did not reveal any 
evidence that either fuel tank contained an appreciable amount of fuel at impact.  The pilot 
reported 94 hours of total flight experience; which included about 13 hours in the same make 
and model as the accident airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
