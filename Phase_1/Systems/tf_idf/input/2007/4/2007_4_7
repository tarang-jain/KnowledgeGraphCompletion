Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The airplane collided with a fence during a rejected takeoff following a partial loss of engine 
power.  The pilot reported that after the airplane lifted off the ground, he retracted the landing 
gear.  Just abeam the tower, he felt a "jolt/engine burp," and noted that he was about 100 feet 
above the ground.  He reduced the power, but was not able to lower the landing gear prior to 
the airplane touching down on the remaining runway.  The airplane slid down the runway, and 
came to a stop after impacting the airport perimeter fence.  A Federal Aviation Administration 
airworthiness inspector examined the engine following the accident and noted that the number 
2 fuel injection nozzle was clogged with unidentified debris that would crumble when touched.  
Inspection of the number 2 cylinder combustion chamber revealed a white coloration on the 
cylinder walls consistent with a lean fuel condition.  No anomalies were noted with the 
remaining fuel injection nozzles and the other cylinders' combustion chambers.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
contamination of the number 2 fuel injector nozzle that lead to a partial loss of engine power.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
