Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The 72-hour private pilot reported that approximately 2-hours and 10-minutes into his 425-
nautical mile flight, while in cruise flight at 5,500 feet MSL, his single-engine airplane 
experienced a complete loss of engine power.  Several attempts to re-start the engine were 
unsuccessful and the pilot elected to execute a forced landing to a grass field.  During the 
emergency descent, the pilot noted that the left and right fuel gauges indicated approximately 
one-fourth a tank of fuel per side.  During the landing roll the nose landing gear sunk into the 
soft ground and the airplane nosed-over coming to rest in an inverted position.  The pilot was 
able to exit the airplane unassisted.  A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector 
responded to the accident site and examined the airplane.  The inspector reported that both 
fuel tanks were found empty and that they did not appear to be compromised.  In addition, the 
inspector reported that he did not observe fuel stains suggesting the fuel had leaked out.  The 
inspector further reported that the right wing had sustained structural damage.  The pilot 
reported that he performed a pre-flight inspection of the airplane and visually verified that 
both fuel tanks were full prior to departure.  Fueling records at the departure airport 
established that the airplane was last fueled two days earlier, with the addition of 30.6 gallons 
of fuel.  The homebuilt airplane had a total fuel capacity of 38-gallons, which provides for a 
cross-country range of approximately 3 hours and 45 minutes.  The pilot had planned for a 2 
hour and 29 minute flight.  The airplane was powered by a Lycoming O-360-A1D engine.  
According to the operator's manual for the engine, the normal fuel consumption rate for that 
engine is 10.5 gallons per hour at 2,450 rpm (75 percent rated power).
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion.  A contributing factor was the lack of suitable 
terrain for the forced landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
