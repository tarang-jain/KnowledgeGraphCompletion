Analysis   
The student pilot successfully performed three autorotations to a hover; however, during the 
fourth, he "landed hard with a yaw to the left."  The flight instructor was not able to correct the 
yaw, and the helicopter impacted the ground, damaging the tail boom.  The accident was not 
reported until the flight instructor was involved in a similar accident, in the same helicopter, 
about 30 days later.  No mechanical deficiencies were reported by the flight instructor or the 
student pilot.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain control of the helicopter during landing, and the flight 
instructor's delayed remedial action.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
