Flight Conducted Under:
Part 121: Air Carrier - Non-scheduled
Analysis 
While flying at 13,000 feet mean sea level (msl), and decelerating to 250 knots in a DC-10-30 
airplane, the horizontal stabilizer could not be moved by either commands from the autopilot 
or using the primary and alternate control switches from the cockpit. The horizontal stabilizer 
remained at approximately 1 degree airplane nose-up which resulted in excessive cockpit 
control forces. An emergency was declared with air traffic control and the flight landed 
uneventfully on runway 27R at ATL. The inoperative horizontal stabilizer trim system was 
caused by improper overhaul of the horizontal stabilizer chain drive unit drive assembly 
(horizontal stabilizer drive assembly) P/N AJH 7337-507, S/N DCA-418 by omission of one pin 
(P/N 3D0009-5-4), one nut (P/N MS21043-08), and one washer (P/N NAS 1252-BL) which 
secure the drive gear of the horizontal stabilizer drive assembly. The omission of the parts 
resulted in fatigue failure of another pin (P/N AJH7378-1) and shear failure of the single 
installed pin (P/N 3D0009-5-4). This prevented output of the horizontal stabilizer drive 
assembly being transmitted to acme screws of the horizontal stabilizer. There was no flight 
crew write-ups for the previous 93 days related to pitch trim. The horizontal stabilizer drive 
assembly was overhauled on April 30, 1999, and installed in the incident airplane on April 23, 
2006. The airplane had accumulated 2,421 hours and 473 cycles since the overhauled assembly 
was installed.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
The improper overhaul of the horizontal stabilizer chain drive unit drive assembly.

Factual Information
On May 2, 2007, about 1106 eastern daylight time, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, N270AX, 
registered to Omni DC-10 Leasing LLC, operated by Omni Air International, Inc., as flight 
"Reach 370," experienced a malfunction of the horizontal stabilizer during a normal descent, 
and landed uneventfully at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), 
Atlanta, Georgia. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and an instrument 
flight rules flight plan was filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121 non-
scheduled, international, passenger flight from Shannon International Airport (EINN), 
Limerick City, Ireland, to ATL. The airplane was not damaged and there were no injuries to the 
airline transport pilot-certificated captain and first officer, flight engineer, 8 cabin attendants, 
3 additional flightcrew members, or 292 passengers. The flight originated about 0330 local, 
from EINN.
After takeoff the flight proceeded towards the destination airport and the captain later stated 
that while flying at 13,000 feet mean sea level (msl), and decelerating to 250 knots, the 
autopilot out of trim light illuminated and remained on for 5 to 6 seconds. The autopilot was 
then disengaged while the flight controls were guarded in anticipation of a change in pitch. The 
airplane pitched "aggressively" nose down, and attempts in resetting/moving the stabilizer 
setting using the pilot's and co-pilot's control wheel trim switches, alternate trim switches, and 
longitudinal trim handles were unsuccessful in repositioning the stabilizer which remained set 
at 1 degree airplane nose up. Readout of the airplane™s flight data recorder (FDR) indicated the 
stabilizer remained at 333 counts through the autopilot disconnect and landing. The approach 
was discontinued, and an emergency was declared with air traffic control. A "demanding 
amount of elevator back pressure was required to maintain level flight...", and the airplane was 
vectored for an uneventful landing on runway 27R with the flaps extended to 35 degrees and 
the No. 2 engine at the flight idle. The airplane taxied to the gate and the passengers were 
deplaned. The FDR further recorded that the stabilizer values transitioned from 337 to 357 
from the descent to just before touchdown of the previous landing.
Examination of the airplane after landing revealed the cockpit indicator for the stabilizer trim 
indicated slighter greater than 1 degree airplane nose-up trim. Postincident testing of the 
horizontal stabilizer trim system revealed no movement of the horizontal stabilizer using the 
cockpit control switches, though electrical continuity was noted at both 
primary trim control valves. Additionally, both hydraulic motors tested satisfactory. Further 
examination of the horizontal stabilizer chain drive unit drive assembly (horizontal stabilizer 
drive assembly) P/N AJH 7337-507, S/N DCA-418, revealed the chain tension and chain wear 
were within limits. Misalignment of a detent ring installed on the horizontal stabilizer drive 
assembly was noted. The horizontal stabilizer drive assembly was removed and retained for 
further examination.
The horizontal stabilizer is movable to provide longitudinal trim, and the horizontal stabilizer 
system consists of five subsystems which are: electrical control, mechanical control, hydraulic 
actuation, mechanical drive, and position indicating and warning systems. Cockpit adjustment 
of the horizontal stabilizer trim is initiated by: actuation of dual trim switches located on the 
outboard horn of each pilots control wheel, actuation of alternate trim switches located on the 
pilots' control pedestal, and actuation of two control handles also located on the pilots™ control 
pedestal which are linked by control cables to two control valves located on the forward side of 
Page 4 of 7MIA07IA088
the stabilizer. Adjustment of the horizontal stabilizer trim is also performed while the autopilot 
is engaged based on input from command signals of the autopilot system.
Movement of the horizontal stabilizer using the cockpit control switches controls two 
electrically controlled hydraulically actuated primary control valves, which direct flow to two 
hydraulic motors. The hydraulic motors convert hydraulic flow into rotary mechanical action of 
output shafts that connect to a gearbox. The gearbox mechanically drives the horizontal 
stabilizer chain drive unit drive assembly (horizontal stabilizer drive assembly). Chains connect 
sprockets of the horizontal stabilizer drive assembly to sprockets near acme screws attached to 
the horizontal stabilizer.
Examination of the horizontal stabilizer drive assembly was performed at the manufacturer™s 
facility with Federal Aviation Administration oversight. Visual examination of the unit revealed 
a ring (P/N AJH7342-503) was rotated approximately 30 degrees from its normally installed 
position based on an index mark on the ring and the assembly centerline. Further visual 
inspection revealed only one pin (P/N 3D0009-5-4), one nut (P/N MS21043-08), and one 
washer (P/N NAS 1252-BL) were received loose. The pin was fractured and the head was 
missing and not located; the remaining portion of the pin was retained for further examination. 
The illustration in the component maintenance manual (CMM) depicts only one pin, washer, 
and nut; however, the parts list for the same illustration specifies that two pins, washers, and 
nuts are required to be installed. The two pins, nuts, and washers in part secure a gear (P/N 
AJH7341-5) to the horizontal stabilizer drive assembly. The gear (P/N AJH7341-5) drives two 
driven gears attached to the horizontal stabilizer drive assembly which in turn move the 
horizontal stabilizer by chains. Additionally, a pin (P/N AJH7378-1) which was installed in 
accordance with Service Bulletin (SB) 27-181 was installed but extended approximately .360 
inch beyond the gear. The pin was comprised of two pieces which were retained for further 
examination.
Examination of the fractured pins (P/N 3D0009-5-4 and P/N AJH7378-1) was performed by 
the National Transportation Safety Board Materials Laboratory located in Washington, D.C. 
The results of the examination of P/N 3D0009-5-4 revealed the fracture surface exhibited 
features consistent with shear. The results of the examination of P/N AJH7378-1 revealed it 
was bent approximately 7 degrees and was within specification with respect to diameter. The 
fracture surface exhibited features consistent with reverse bending fatigue. Hardness testing or 
material property confirmation was not performed on either of the fractured pins.
Review of the airplane™s discrepancies for the previous 93 days revealed no write-up by any 
flightcrew member pertaining to the stabilizer trim.
The maintenance records indicate that the horizontal stabilizer drive assembly was overhauled 
on April 30, 1999, and installed in the incident airplane on April 23, 2006. The airplane had 
accumulated 2,421 hours and 473 cycles since the overhauled assembly was installed.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
