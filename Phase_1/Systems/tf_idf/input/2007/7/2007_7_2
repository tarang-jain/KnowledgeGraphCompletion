Analysis   
The pilot stated that the takeoff was normal.  His glider and the tow plane were on the initial 
climb out. During the climb they began to encounter heavy turbulence. At 200 feet AGL he 
continued to encounter heavy turbulence and bumped his head twice against the canopy. He 
inadvertently hit the release cable handle at a low altitude, and disconnected from the tow 
plane. He attempted to return to the airport and collided with trees after losing lift. The pilot 
did not report any flight control anomalies with the glider.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
