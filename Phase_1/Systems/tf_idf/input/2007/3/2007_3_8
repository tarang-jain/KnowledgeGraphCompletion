Analysis   
The conventional gear airplane bounced two times after touchdown and nosed over.  On the 
first bounce, the pilot added a small amount of power to allow the airplane to settle back onto 
the runway.  However, the airplane bounced again, and he added full power in an attempt to go 
around and pushed forward on the control stick.  The propeller then contacted the runway and 
the airplane nosed over.  The pilot stated that there were no mechanical failures or 
malfunctions during the flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper bounced landing recovery and improper use of the flight controls that

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
