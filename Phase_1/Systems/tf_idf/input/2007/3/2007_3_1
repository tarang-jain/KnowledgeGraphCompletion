Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Ponca City, OK
Accident Number:
DFW07LA080
Date & Time:
03/01/2007, 0755 CST 
Registration:
N1554Z
Aircraft:
Beech P35
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that the engine lost power when the airplane was established on a 5-mile 
straight-in final approach.  The 511-hour private pilot elected to turn the airplane toward a 
level open field located on the airport property.  While crossing the airport's perimeter road, 
the airplane "clipped" the top of a moving automobile and subsequently impacted a fence.  
There was no post impact fire and the pilot was able to exit the airplane unassisted.  An 
examination of the airplane by an airframe and powerplant mechanic (A&P) under the 
supervision of the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC), did not revealed any pre-impact 
anomalies.  The reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.  A contributing factor was the lack of 
suitable terrain for the forced landing.

Factual Information
On March 1, 2007, about 0755 central standard time, a single-engine Beech P35 airplane, 
N1554Z, was substantially damaged during a forced landing following a loss of engine power 
while on final approach to the Ponca City Regional Airport (PNC), near Ponca City, Oklahoma.  
The private pilot, sole occupant of the airplane, sustained minor injuries.  The airplane was 
registered to and operated by the pilot.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no 
flight plan was filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.  The 114-
nautical mile cross-country flight originated at 0705 from the Clinton Regional Airport (CLK), 
near Clinton, Oklahoma, and was destined for PNC.
According to the pilot, while on a five mile final approach for Runway 35 at PNC, he reduced 
engine power to intercept the glide slope.  Once established on the glide slope, the pilot 
attempted to add engine power.  The pilot reported that when he added throttle, the engine 
"sputtered" and then experienced a complete loss of power.  The pilot added that he pumped 
the throttle and switched the fuel selector valve from the left fuel tank to the right fuel tank 
position in an attempt to restore engine power.  The engine power was not restored. The pilot 
elected to turn the airplane towards a flat open field located on the airport property.  While 
crossing the airport's perimeter road, the airplane "clipped" the top of a moving automobile 
and subsequently impacted a chain-link fence.  There was no post impact fire and the pilot was 
able to exit the airplane unassisted.  The driver of the automobile was not injured.
According to photos provided to the NTSB, the airplane came to rest in an upright position on 
the right main landing gear and the lower engine cowling.  The left wing was separated from 
the fuselage.  
The airplane was later examined by an airframe and powerplant mechanic (A&P) under the 
supervision of the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC).  The examination revealed the following:  
A liquid consistent with aviation fuel was present in the left and right fuel tanks.  The airplane's 
electric fuel pump was operational and displaced fuel when both the left and right fuel tanks 
were individually selected.  The engine's mechanical fuel pump was removed and examined.  
The diaphragm was found intact and no anomalies were noted.  
The engine's valve covers and propeller were removed and the engine was rotated via the 
starter.  Thumb compression was obtained in each cylinder and valve train continuity was 
established.  The left and right magnetos produced spark to all spark plugs when rotated.  Oil 
was present in the oil sump.  According to the A&P, no anomalies were noted that would have 
prevented the engine from producing power.  The reason for the loss of engine power could not 
be determined.   
At 0753, the weather observation facility at PNC reported, wind from 280 degrees at 10 knots, 
visibility 10 statute miles, few clouds at 2,900 feet, temperature 37 degrees Fahrenheit, dew 
point 30 degrees Fahrenheit, and a barometric pressure of 29.60 inches of Mercury.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
