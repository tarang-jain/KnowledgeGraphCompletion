Analysis   
Both main landing gears on a tailwheel-equipped homebuilt airplane collapsed during the 
landing roll.  The 34,000-hour airline transport pilot, who was not the owner, reported that 
during the landing roll on the 6,000-foot-long, by 150-foot-wide asphalt runway, he began to 
apply "slight braking pressure."  The pilot reported that the single-engine airplane began to 
"shudder rapidly."  The left main landing gear collapsed, and immediately following that, the 
right main landing gear also collapsed.  The radial engine powered airplane came to rest on the 
centerline of runway 14 and the pilot exited the airplane unassisted without injuries.  
Examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector, revealed that the left wing sustained 
structural damage; however, he was unable to determine the reason for the failure of the 
landing gear.  The winds at the time of the mishap were reported from 140 degrees at 8 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
