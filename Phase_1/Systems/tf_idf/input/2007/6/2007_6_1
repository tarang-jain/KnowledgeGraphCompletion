Analysis   
The solo private pilot was landing at a remote airstrip on a Title 14, CFR Part 91, cross-country 
personal flight.  The pilot said that the gravel-covered airstrip was about 800 feet long and 
about 20 feet wide, and he inadvertently allowed the airplane to touchdown about midway on 
the site.  He attempted to abort the landing by abruptly advancing the throttle, but the engine 
was unable to produce full power before the airplane contacted high brush and trees at the 
departure end of the site. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, 
and empennage.  The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical anomalies.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
