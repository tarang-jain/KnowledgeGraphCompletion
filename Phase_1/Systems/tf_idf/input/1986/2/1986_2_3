Analysis 
THE PLT WAS RELYING ON HIS LORAN C FOR NAVIGATION WHEN HE DECIDED TO 
ALTER HIS DESTINATION TO DELAWARE MUNICIPAL ARPT DUE TO ADVERSE WINDS 
AND TURBULENCE. HE HAD BEEN CHECKING HIS CHARTS FOR OBSTRUCTIONS 
WHEN THE ACFT COLLIDED WITH TREES IN A WOODED AREA SHORT OF HIS 
DESTINATION. THE PLT HAD JUST DESCENDED TO 2200 FT MSL TO AVOID 
TURBULENCE . HE STATED HE MAY HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT HIS CHARTS FOR UP TO 
FORTY SECONDS BUT THAT WAS NOT CUSTOMARY FOR HIM BECAUSE HIS ACFT 'HAS 
A TENDENCY TO ENTER A LEFT TURN EASY, HANDS OFF.'

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
