Analysis 
THE RIGHT ENGINE WAS STARTED AS THE PASSENGERS COMPLETED BOARDING. 
AFTER THE COPILOT SECURED THE CABIN DOOR AND TOOK HIS SEAT, THE PILOT 
RELEASED THE PARKING BRAKE AND CONTROL LOCK AND APPLIED POWER TO TAXI. 
WHEN A TURN WAS COMMANDED THE NOSEWHEEL STEERING DID NOT RESPOND 
AND THE PILOT APPLIED NORMAL AND EMERGENCY BRAKING WITHOUT EFFECT ON 
THE AIRCRAFTS MOVEMENT. THE PILOT THEN ORDERED THE RIGHT ENGINE SHUT 
DOWN. THE AIRCRAFT CONTINUED TO ROLL ACROSS THE RAMP UNTIL IT COLLIDED 
WITH A PARKED AIRCRAFT. THE OPERATOR HAD EXPERIENCED SIMILAR FAILURES 
DURING THE 6 MONTHS PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT. HOWEVER, ALL EFFORTS TO 
DUPLICATE AND ISOLATE THE PROBLEMS HAD BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL. DURING POST 
INCIDENT REPAIRS, NUMEROUS LANDING GEAR SYSTEM COMPONENTS WERE 
REPLACED AND THE PROBLEM HAS NOT SURFACED AGAIN. NO REASON FOR THE 
ORIGINAL FAILURES WAS DETERMINED.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
