Analysis 
THE AIRCRAFT WAS ON A ROUND TRIP FLIGHT FROM BARROW, AK TO POINT HOPE, 
AK AND RETURN. AFTER LANDING AT POINT HOPE, THERE WAS A 20 MIN DELAY 
WHILE WAITING FOR THE GROUND CREW. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE RAN THE 
ENGINES FOR SOME 10 MIN OR SO DUE TO THE HIGH WINDS AND COLD. HE STATED 
THAT THE WIND WAS AVERAGING ABOUT 45 KTS AND WAS TOO STRONG TO 
MAINTAIN CONTROL ON TOP OF THE AIRCRAFT FOR REFUELING. THE PILOT 
CALCULATED THAT HE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH FUEL TO RETURN TO BARROW. 
WHILE RETURNING, HE FLEW PAST TWO POSSIBLE REFUEL POINTS AND A THIRD 
PLACE WHERE HE COULD HAVE LANDED. WHILE OVER WATER NEAR HIS 
DESTINATION, THE LEFT ENGINE FLAMED OUT AND THE PILOT INCORRECTLY SHUT 
DOWN THE RIGHT ENGINE. HE WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE RIGHT ENGINE, BUT IT 
SOON FLAMED OUT ALSO. A SUCCESSFUL FORCED LANDING WAS THEN MADE ON 
THE TUNDRA. ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, THE ENGINE FLAMED OUT DUE TO LACK 
OF FUEL.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
