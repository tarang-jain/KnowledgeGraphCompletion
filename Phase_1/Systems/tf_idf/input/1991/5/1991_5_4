Analysis 
SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF, WHILE CLIMBING TO CRUISE ALTITUDE, THE PILOT 
REPORTED THE LEFT ENGINE COWL ASSEMBLY HAD COME OFF. WITNESSES 
OBSERVED THE AIRPLANE AT LOW ALTITUDE & NOTED THAT IT WAS 'YAWING, 
SPUTTERING, AND ROCKING BACK AND FORTH.'  THEY INDICATED THE LEFT ENGINE 
WAS NOT RUNNING & THAT THE AIRPLANE BANKED SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT & 
DISAPPEARED BEHIND TREES BEFORE CRASHING. AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED 
THE LEFT PROPELLER HAD NOT BEEN FEATHERED. THE LEFT ENGINE COWLING 
WAS FOUND 1.8 MILES FROM THE ACCIDENT SITE. THE THREE PRIMARY (EYEBOLT) 
COWL FASTERERS ON THE OUTBOARD SIDE OF THE LEFT UPPER COWL WERE FOUND 
UNLOCKED & SEVEN OTHER COWL ATTACHING STUDS (SCREWS) WERE MISSING. 
THE COWLING HAD BEEN REMOVED 16 DAYS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT TO INSTALL AN 
OIL/AIR SEPARATOR. THIS WAS THE FIRST FLIGHT SINCE THAT WORK WAS 
PERFORMED. THE MECHANIC, WHO DID THE WORK, SAID HE NOTED SEVERAL COWL 
STUD FASTENERS WERE MISSING & THAT HE HAD NOTIFIED THE PILOT. THE PILOT 
WAS REPORTED TO HAVE REPLIED THAT HE HAD SOME FASTENERS & WOULD TAKE 
CARE OF THE PROBLEM. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
IN-FLIGHT SEPARATION OF THE LEFT ENGINE COWL ASSEMBLY THAT WAS NOT 
PROPERLY LATCHED, AND FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM 
CONTROL SPEED, WHICH RESULTED IN HIS LOSS OF AIRCRAFT CONTROL.  FACTORS 
RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: AN INADEQUATE PREFLIGHT INSPECTION, 
INADEQUATE MARKINGS/ALIGNMENT INDICATIONS TO ASSURE THAT THE COWL 
FASTENERS WERE LOCKED, AND AN INSUFFICIENTLY DEFINED PROCEDURE IN THE 
FLIGHT MANUAL FOR CHECKING THE COWL FASTENERS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
