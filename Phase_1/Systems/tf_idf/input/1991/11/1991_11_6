Analysis 
 AFTER TAKEOFF WITH THE FUEL SELECTOR POSITIONED TO THE AUXILIARY FUEL 
TANK, THE ENG QUIT DUE TO FUEL EXHAUSTION IN THAT TANK.  THE PLT 
REPOSITIONED THE FUEL SELECTOR TO THE MAIN FUEL TANK POSITION WHICH 
CONTAINED AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF FUEL, BUT THE ENG STARTED ONLY 
MOMENTARILY, THEN QUIT.  THE PILOT LANDED THE ACFT GEAR UP IN A FIELD. 
EXAM OF THE ACFT BY AN FAA AIRWORTHINESS INSPECTOR REVEALED THAT A 
RUBBER FUEL LINE WHICH CONNECTS THE MAIN TANK TO THE FUEL SELECTOR 
WAS BLOCKED BY CONTAMINANTS.  THE PLT HAD IN THE PAST OPERATED THE ENG 
USING AUTOMOTIVE FUEL WITHOUT AN STC.  HE WAS ALSO AWARE BEFORE THE 
ACCIDENT THAT THE ENG WOULD LOSE POWER WITH THE FUEL SELECTOR 
POSITIONED TO THE MAIN TANK. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 OPERATION BY THE OWNER/PILOT-IN-COMMAND WITH KNOWN DEFICIENCIES IN 
EQUIPMENT AND FUEL STARVATION DUE TO A BLOCKED FUEL LINE.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
