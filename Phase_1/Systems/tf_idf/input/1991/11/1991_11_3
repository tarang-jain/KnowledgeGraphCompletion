Analysis 
 WITNESSES AT THE AIRPORT STATED THAT JUST AFTER THE AIRPLANE LIFTED OFF 
RUNWAY 16R, IT IMMEDIATELY BEGAN A VERY TIGHT 360 DEGREE TURN AND 
CRASHED BETWEEN RUNWAY 16L AND THE ADJACENT TAXIWAY. THE PILOT STATED 
TO FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) INSPECTORS THAT, AFTER LIFTOFF, 
THE AIRPLANE BEGAN TURNING TO THE LEFT AND TRYING TO DIVE AND THAT HE 
HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY OVERRIDING THE FORCES ON THE CONTROLS.  THE PILOT, 
WHO IS ALSO A CERTIFIED FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR, STATED THAT HE WAS FLYING THE 
AIRPLANE FROM THE RIGHT FRONT SEAT.  FAA INSPECTORS EXAMINED THE 
WRECKAGE AND FOUND THE RIGHT SEAT RUDDER PEDAL COLLAPSED TO THE 
FLOOR.  THE FAA INSPECTOR PULLED THE STOWABLE RUDDER PEDAL INTO THE 
FLIGHT POSITION, AND IT LOCKED IN PLACE.  WHEN THE FAA INSPECTOR APPLIED 
HAND PRESSURE TO BOTH PEDALS, THE RIGHT PEDAL SNAPPED INTO THE RETRACT 
POSITION.  HE ATTEMPTED THIS SEVERAL TIMES.  THE FAA INSPECTOR 
DISASSEMBLED THE PEDAL AND FOUND THAT THE PIN RECEIVING HOLE WAS WORN 
OBLONG, ALLOWING THE PIN TO DISENGAGE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE INADVERTENT LOSS OF CONTROL DURING THE INITIAL CLIMB AFTER TAKEOFF 
THAT RESULTED FROM THE COLLAPSE OF THE RUDDER PEDAL BECAUSE OF A WORN 
LOCKING PIN HOLE IN THE RUDDER PEDAL STOWING SYSTEM, WHICH ALLOWED 
THE PIN TO DISENGAGE.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
