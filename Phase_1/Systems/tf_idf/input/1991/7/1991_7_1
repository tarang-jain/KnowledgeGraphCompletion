Analysis 
 THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO LAND ON THE 6,000 FOOT RIDGE AND MADE A GO 
AROUND. HE MADE A SECOND ATTEMPT WITH THE WIND AS A RIGHT QUARTERING 
HEADWIND.  THE PILOT STATED THE WIND WAS VARIABLE AND GUSTY.  DURING HIS

 THE PILOT'S LACK OF COMPENSATION FOR WIND CONDITIONS AND CONTINUED 
OPERATION WITH THE WIND IN THE 'CRITICAL WIND AZIMUTH' AREA WHICH LED 
TO LIMITED TAIL ROTOR AUTHORITY. CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
