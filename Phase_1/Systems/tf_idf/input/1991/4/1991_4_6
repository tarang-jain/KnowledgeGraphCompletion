Analysis 
 THE CERTIFICATED COMMERCIAL PILOT, WITH ONE PASSENGER, WAS ON A FLIGHT 
BETWEEN TWO TUNA FISHING VESSELS IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS.  AS THE PILOT 
BEGAN A CLIMB FROM ABOUT 100 FEET ABOVE THE WATER, HE DISCOVERED THAT 
THE CYCLIC CONTROL WAS BINDING IN ITS LONGITUDINAL AXIS.  THE HELICOPTER 
CONTINUED TO CLIMB UNTIL IT REACHED A NEAR VERTICAL ATTITUDE.  THE PILOT 
APPLIED RUDDER PEDAL TO SWING THE NOSE DOWN.  THE HELICOPTER THEN 
DESCENDED RAPIDLY TO THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN WHERE A FLOAT ATTACHED 
TO THE LANDING GEAR SKID CONTACTED THE WATER.  THE FLOATS WERE TORN 
OFF AND THE HELICOPTER CARTWHEELED AND SANK.  THE PILOT AND PASSENGER 
RECEIVED MINOR INJURIES.  THE HELICOPTER WAS NOT RECOVERED. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE HELICOPTER DUE TO A RESTRICTION OF THE CYCLIC 
CONTROL SYSTEM.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
