Analysis 
 THE AIRCRAFT WAS ON CLIMB OUT WHEN A LOUD BANG WAS HEARD, FOLLOWED 
BY AN ENGINE OVERSPEED THEN ENGINE STOPPAGE.  AFTER THE FORCED LANDING, 
THE PILOTS FOUND THAT BOTH WOODEN PROPELLER BLADES HAD SEPARATED 
FROM THE STEEL HUB ASSEMBLY.  THE PROPELLER HUB WAS REMOVED FROM THE 
ENGINE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS AND 
DISASSEMBLY UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF FAA INSPECTORS.  THE MANUFACTURER 
STATED THAT ALL INTERNAL COMPONENTS WERE FUNCTIONAL, HOWEVER, THE 
CAM ADJUSTMENT FOR THE HIGH AND LOW PITCH STOP SETTINGS HAD BEEN 
ALTERED FROM THE FACTORY SETTINGS. THE BLADE BUTT ENDS RETAINED IN THE 
HUB WERE REMOVED AND SUBMITTED TO THE FOREST PRODUCTS LABORATORY OF 
THE US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE FOR ANALYSIS.  ACCORDING TO THE 
LABORATORY THE WOODEN BLADES FRACTURED AND SEPARATED DUE TO A 
HYDROLYSIS INTERACTION BETWEEN THE WOOD AND THE ADHESIVE CAUSED BY 
EXCESS MOISTURE AND HEAT.  THE HYDROLYSIS IS A CHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION 
PROCESS OF THE WOOD AND GLUE RELATIONSHIP. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE FAILURE OF THE PROPELLER BLADES DUE TO A WEAKENING OF THE WOOD 
STRUCTURE DUE TO ACID HYDROLYSIS.  A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT WAS THE 
INADEQUATE MAINTENANCE OF THE PROPELLER ASSEMBLY BY ALLOWING 
EXPOSURE TO EXCESSIVE MOISTURE AND HEAT.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
