gusts to 27 knots. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's misjudged wind conditions and his not obtaining/maintaining compensation for 
wind conditions.  A factor was a sudden wind shift. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - IN FLIGHT
Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - INITIAL CLIMB
Findings
1. (F) WEATHER CONDITION - SUDDEN WINDSHIFT
2. (C) PREFLIGHT PLANNING/PREPARATION - MISJUDGED - PILOT IN COMMAND
3. (C) COMPENSATION FOR WIND CONDITIONS - NOT OBTAINED/MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND

Factual Information
 On June 1, 1998, at 1700 central daylight time, a Cessna 175A, N6847E, operated by a private 
pilot descended into the terrain after liftoff from runway 31 (5,160' x 100' dry/asphalt) at Karl 
Stefan Memorial Airport, near Norfolk, Nebraska.  The airplane was destroyed on impact with 
the terrain and a post accident fire.  The pilot and two passengers reported minor injuries.  The 
pilot stated that the airplane may have encountered windshear and was unable to climb.  The 
personal 14 CFR Part 91 flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions.  No flight 
plan was on file.  The flight was originating at the time of the accident.
The pilot said that the airplane lifted off at about 65 knots.  He said that when the airplane 
reached an altitude of about 200 to 300 feet, the airplane began to descend and he was unable 
to get the airplane to maintain flight.  He said, "I believe the sole cause of the accident to be a 
change in wind direction and/or velocity, complicated by large groves of trees to the west of the 
runway ... ."  He said that there was no mechanical failure or loss of power in the airplane.  He 
said that just prior to impact he extended the flaps to full.
The departure was on runway 31.  The winds recorded at the departure airport six minutes 
prior to the accident were 270 degrees at 23 knots with gusts to 27 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
