Cessna 140
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane was on approach to the 1,863 foot long, asphalt runway.  The pilot stated, 'Just 
before the final flare a hornet distracted me to the extent I lost concentration to the task of 
landing.  I touched down 'long.'  Seeing only a short area in which to stop, I applied full power 
to go around, but there was not enough room before the reeds in the swampy area.'  The 
airplane struck the reeds and nosed over.  Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any 
mechanical malfunctions of the airframe or engine.  Wind reported at airports about 15 miles 
west, and 23 miles east of the accident site at 1345, were from 330 degrees at 15 knots, with 20 
knot gusts, and from 350 degrees at 10 knots, respectively. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper in-flight decision to continue the landing and his delayed go-around 
attempt.  A factor in this accident was the pilot's diverted attention.

Factual Information
 On June 1, 1998, about 1415 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 140, N72657, was 
substantially damaged during landing at the Griswold Airport (N04), Madison, Connecticut.  
The certificated private pilot and passenger were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and no flight plan had been filed for the flight that departed Skylark Airpark Airport, 
Warehouse, Connecticut, about 1330, destined for N04.  The personal flight was conducted 
under 14 CFR Part 91.
The airplane was on approach to runway 06, a 1,863 foot long, asphalt runway.  In a 
written statement, the pilot said: 
" Just before final flare for landing a hornet distracted me to the extent I lost concentration to 
the task of landing.  I touched down 'long.'  Seeing only a short area in which to stop, I applied 
full power to go around, but there was not enough room before the reeds in the swampy area...I 
was carrying a little extra speed on final because the wind was switching about 90 degrees from 
time to time...."
The airplane struck the reeds, and nosed over.
Examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration Inspector did not 
reveal evidence of a pre-impact malfunction of the airframe or engine.
Wind reported at airports about 15 miles west, and 23 miles east of the accident site at 
1345, were from 330 degrees at 15 knots, with 20 knot gusts, and from 350 degrees at 10 knots, 
respectively.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
