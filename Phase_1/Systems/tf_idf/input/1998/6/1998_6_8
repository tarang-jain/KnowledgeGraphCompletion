Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
GREENFIELD, IA
Accident Number:
CHI98LA186
Date & Time:
06/02/1998, 1830 CDT 
Registration:
N487JS
Aircraft:
Sheets KITFOX II
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot stated that he was using 20-degrees of flaps for takeoff, which is not the normal 
takeoff configuration, because he was testing a new takeoff technique he had seen in an 
aviation publication.  The piloted stated that the aircraft became airborne, sooner than 
expected, and drifted to the right of the runway centerline.  While the aircraft was drifting 
across the runway it impacted the ground approximately 30' from the runway centerline.  In a 
telephone conversation with the pilot, he stated that the accident could of been avoided if he 
had built up additional airspeed before liftoff and after liftoff kept the aircraft low in ground 
effect. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the initial climb airspeed not obtained/maintained after liftoff by the pilot in command.  A 
factor was the improper compensation for wind conditions by the pilot in command. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - IN FLIGHT
Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - INITIAL CLIMB
Findings
1. (C) AIRSPEED - NOT OBTAINED/MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND
2. (F) COMPENSATION FOR WIND CONDITIONS - IMPROPER - PILOT IN COMMAND
----------
Occurrence #2: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER
Phase of Operation: DESCENT - UNCONTROLLED

Factual Information
 On June 2, 1998, at 1830 central daylight time, a Sheets Kitfox II, N487JS, piloted by a private 
pilot, was destroyed when it impacted the terrain, following a loss of control during takeoff 
from runway 32 (2500' x 45', dry, asphalt) at the Greenfield Municipal Airport, near 
Greenfield, Iowa.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The 
14 CFR Part 91 personal flight was not operating on a flight plan.  The pilot sustained minor 
injuries.  The one passenger reported no injures.  The local flight was originating at the time of 
the accident.
According to the pilot's written statement, the pilot was attempting a normal takeoff at the time 
of the accident.  The pilot stated that he was using 20-degrees of flaps for takeoff, which is not 
the normal takeoff configuration, because he was testing a new takeoff technique he had seen 
in an aviation publication.  The piloted stated that the aircraft became airborne, sooner than 
expected, and drifted to the right of the runway centerline.  While the aircraft was drifting 
across the runway it impacted the ground approximately 30' from the runway centerline.
In a telephone conversation with the pilot, he stated that the accident could of been avoided if 
he had built up additional airspeed before liftoff and after liftoff kept the aircraft low in ground 
effect.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
