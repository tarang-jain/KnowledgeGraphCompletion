 On September 1, 1998, about 1200 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 172G, N5797R, 
registered to an individual, collided with a fence at Leesburg Municipal Airport, Leesburg,

The pilot stated that when he attempted to begin taxiing for takeoff, the aircraft would 
not move. He left the engine running and exited the aircraft to see if he had left the wheel 
chocks in place. As he exited the aircraft it began to move. The wind from the propeller

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
