Analysis 
The pilot of the other airplane was taxiing for departure on a north-south taxiway for a 
departure from runway 18R.  He reported that the ATIS advised all traffic to watch the flagmen 
for ATC instructions.  The pilot reported that he was watching the flagman as instructed.  The 
pilot reported, 'The flagman gave me a signal to stop as I approached the intersection, and then 
changed to the right turn signal.  I started my right turn.  The flagman gave me no indication 
that there was an aircraft in my path, or that I should do anything other than complete the 
turn.'  He reported that he was about halfway through the turn when his propeller struck the 
right wingtip of the RV-6.  He reported, 'I was confident that this area was clear because the 
flagman, with a clear view, directed me to make the turn.'  The pilot of the RV-6 was not aware 
of the conflict until the Cessna's propeller hit the right wing and aileron of his airplane.

the pilot of the other airplane did not maintain proper clearance.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
