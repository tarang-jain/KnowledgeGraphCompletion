Factual Information
 On January 2, 1998, about 1415 eastern standard time, a Cessna 172P, N9912L, was 
substantially damaged as it collided with a parked vehicle while taxiing at the Augusta State 
Airport, Augusta, Maine.  The certificated private pilot and the pilot rated passenger were not 
injured.  Visual meteorological conditions existed and no flight plan was file for the ferry flight 
conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.  The airplane, registered to the Civil Air Patrol (CAP), 
Maxwell AFB, Alabama, departed the Northern Maine Regional/Presque Isle Airport, Presque 
Isle, Maine, at 1230.
The pilot reported that it snowed the previous day, and residual snow and ice were obstructing 
the taxiway lines.  The pilot recalled that as he was taxiing, he used a row of hangars to his right 
to assist in judging the distance from parked airplanes on his left.  Focusing their attention 
right and left, both the pilot and the passenger stated that they did not notice the vehicle 
parked in front of the hangars.  The pilot applied the brakes, and the airplane impacted the 
vehicle with the right wing.
The Federal Aviation Administration Inspectors examined the airplane on January 7, 1998.  
The examination revealed damage to the right wing spar, and upgraded this incident to an 
accident.  No mechanical malfunctions were found with the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
