During landing, the tailwheel-equipped biplane bounced and then touched down hard at which 
point the right main landing gear failed.  The airplane exited the left side of the runway and 
nosed down.  The pilot commented that the accident could have been prevented by less sink 
rate at touchdown. 
Probable Cause and Findings

The pilot's failure to obtain/maintain the proper descent rate which resulted in a hard landing.

Factual Information
 On May 1, 1998, approximately 1730 central daylight time, a Schrack Starduster Too amateur-
built experimental airplane, N5462, sustained substantial damage during a hard landing at the 
Hilltop Lakes Airport in Hilltop Lakes, Texas.  The airplane was registered to and operated by a 
private pilot, the sole occupant, who was not injured.  No flight plan was filed and visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed for the Title 14 CFR Part 91 personal local flight.
The pilot reported that during a wheel landing, the tailwheel-equipped biplane "bounced at 
touchdown and a transition to a 3 point landing was made."  He further reported that "the 
resulting touchdown was hard, at which point the right gear apparently failed."  The airplane 
then exited the left side of the runway, the right main landing gear "dug into the sandy soil," 
and the airplane nosed down.  According to the pilot, the accident could have been prevented 
by "less sink rate at touchdown." 
According to the FAA inspector who examined the airplane, the wood spars of the right lower 
wing and left upper wing were broken.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
