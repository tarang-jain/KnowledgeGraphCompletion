Factual Information
 On April 2, 1998, at 1915 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-28-180, N44181, was substantially 
damaged while landing to Warren Airpark, Warren, Pennsylvania.  The certificated private 
pilot received serious injuries and two passengers sustained minor injuries.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight that originated from Tappahannock, 
Virginia, approximately 1835.  No flight plan was filed for the flight conducted under 14 CFR 
Part 91.
The pilot stated he did not experience any mechanical problems with the airplane.  He also 
stated the airplane was on a stabilized approach at 50 feet, with full flaps and indicating 70 
knots, when the airplane developed a "high sink rate."  At 30 feet, the pilot tried to arrest the 
excessive rate of descent with power.  The airplane struck a drop off on the approach end of 
Runway 24, shearing the landing gear before coming to rest upright 40 feet down the runway.
A Federal Aviation Administration Inspector described the 15 foot drop, located 100 feet short 
of the landing threshold, as vertical.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
