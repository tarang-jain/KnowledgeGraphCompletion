& STANDING PROCEDURES FOR GROUND CONTROLLERS PROHIBITED SUCH 
OPERATIONS. THE GROUND CONTROL POSITION WAS BEING WORKED BY A

GATE 75 WITH THE CALL SIGN 'UNITED 75 TOW.'  THIS CALL SIGN WAS DERIVED BY 
USING THE COMPANY NAME (UNITED), THE GATE NUMBER (75), & THE WORD 'TOW.'  
WHILE IT WAS BEING TAXIED, UNITED FLT 75 OBTAINED CLEARANCE TO TAXI, BUT

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
