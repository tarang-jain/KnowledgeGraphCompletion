Analysis 
THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR SAID THAT THE FLIGHT FLEW TO THE AIRSTRIP AT 
MARICOPA, ARIZONA, IN ORDER THAT THE 16 HOUR PRIMARY STUDENT COULD 
PRACTICE TAKEOFFS AND LANDINGS. ACCORDING TO THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR, 
THE AIRCRAFT WAS ON A STABILIZED SHORT FINAL APPROACH WITH FULL FLAPS 
AND AT ABOUT 60 KNOTS INDICATED AIRSPEED. AS THE AIRCRAFT CROSSED A ROW 
OF TREES ORIENTED PERPENDICULAR TO THE RUNWAY THE AIRSPEED SUDDENLY 
DROPPED TO 40 KNOTS INDICATED AND THE AIRCRAFT ENTERED A SINK RATE THAT 
COULD NOT BE ARRESTED PRIOR TO THE AIRCRAFT LANDING HARD ON THE 
RUNWAY. THE INSTRUCTOR STATED THAT THE WINDS WERE ABOUT 15 KNOTS 
DOWN THE RUNWAY WITH GUSTS TO 25 KNOTS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE FAILURE OF THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR TO ENSURE THAT AN ADEQUATE 
AIRSPEED WAS MAINTAINED DURING THE FINAL APPROACH FOR THE EXISTING 
WIND CONDITIONS; TO ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE THE CONDUCT OF THE FLIGHT; 
AND TO ARREST THE RATE OF DESCENT PRIOR TO TOUCH DOWN.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
