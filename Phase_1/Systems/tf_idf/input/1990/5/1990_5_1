Analysis 
AFTER RUNNING OUT OF FUEL, THE HELICOPTER WAS AUTOROTATED INTO A 
WOODED AREA, RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. THE PILOT STATED THAT 
LACK OF SUFFICIENT REST CONTRIBUTED TO FAILING TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE 
FUEL TANK COULD NOT BE COMPLETELY REFUELED BECAUSE THE AIRCRAFT WAS 
PARKED ON A SLOPE DURING REFUELING. HE ALSO STATED THAT FATIGUE MAY 
HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO HIS DECISION TO TRY TO MAKE IT TO THE AIRPORT EVEN 
THOUGH HE KNEW HE WAS RUNNING OUT OF FUEL. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S IMPROPER PREFLIGHT AND IMPROPER IN-FLIGHT 
PLANNING/DECISION. PILOT FATIGUE WAS A RELATED FACTOR.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
