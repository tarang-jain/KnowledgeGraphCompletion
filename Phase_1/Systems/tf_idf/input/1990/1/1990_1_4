Analysis 
A STUDENT PILOT HAD COMPLETED HIS SOLO AIR WORK & WAS ATTEMPTING TO 
RETURN TO HIS HOME AIRFIELD. AFTER PROCEEDING ON THE HEADING FROM THE 
PRACTICE AREA TO THE AIRFIELD FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES, HE BECAME 
CONCERNED, & HEADED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. HE RECOGNIZED HE WAS 
LOST. COMMUNICATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED WITH APPROACH CONTROL 
THROUGH ANOTHER AIRPLANE FROM THE SAME OPERATOR. A HEADING WAS 
PROVIDED TO HOME BASE. WHEN HE REPORTED OVER ANOTHER AIRPORT HE WAS 
INSTRUCTED TO LAND BY THE OPERATOR. DURING THE LANDING FLARE THE 
STUDENT LOST DIRECTIONAL CONTRO, ATTEMPTED A GO AROUND, OVER RAN THE

THE STUDENT PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT AIRSPEED THROUGH THE

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
