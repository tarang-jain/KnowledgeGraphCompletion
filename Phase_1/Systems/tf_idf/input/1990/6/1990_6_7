Analysis 
THE PRIVATE GLIDER PILOT WAS ATTEMPTING AN AEROTOW TAKEOFF UTILIZING A 
CESSNA 150 AS A TOW PLANE. DURING THE TAKEOFF, THE TOW PLANE ABORTED 
THE TAKEOFF. WHEN THE GLIDER PILOT REALIZED THAT THE TOW PLANE HAD 
ABORTED THE TAKEOFF, HE WAS ALREADY AIRBORNE AND DID NOT HAVE 
SUFFICIENT RUNWAY LEFT TO LAND. WHILE MANEUVERING THE AIRCRAFT FOR AN 
EMERGENCY LANDING, THE AIRCRAFT STALLED AND COLLIDED WITH THE TERRAIN. 
SUBSEQUENT INVESGIATION REVEALED NO MECHANIC MALFUNCTIONS WITH 
EITHER THE GLIDER OR THE TOW PLANE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE INATTENTIVENESS OF THE GLIDER PILOT TO THE ABORTED TAKEOFF OF THE 
TOW PLANE, WHICH RESULTED IN HIS DELAYED ACTION IN ATTEMPTING TO 
EXECUTE A FORCED LANDING. THESE ACTIONS RESULTED IN AN INADVERTENT 
STALL AND THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH THE TERRAIN.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
