Analysis 
THE CFI REPORTED THAT THE DUAL STUDENT PILOT INITIATED THE TAKEOFF ROLL 
WITH AILERON INTO THE WIND (LEFT AILERON), BUT THAT HE RELAXED AILERON 
PRESSURE PREMATURELY. WHEN INSTRUCTED TO INCREASE LEFT AILERON, THE 
STUDENT REACTED BY APPLYING LEFT RUDDER & LEFT BRAKE. AT THAT TIME, THE 
ACFT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE TRAVELING ABOUT 45 TO 50 MPH. THE ACFT SWERVED 
TO THE LEFT & THE CFI WAS UNABLE TO REGAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL. 
SUBSEQUENTLY, THE ACFT WENT OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RWY, ENCOUNTERED 
'SOFT GRASS' & WAS DAMAGED. THE STUDENT HAD ONLY 4 HRS OF FLT TIME. THE 
CFI HAD OBTAINED HIS CFI RATING ON 12/20/88 & HAD ACCUMULATED 82 HRS OF 
INSTRUCTION SINCE THAT TIME. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
IMPROPER USE OF FLIGHT CONTROLS BY THE STUDENT PILOT, WHICH RESULTED IN 
HIS LOSS OF DIRECTIONAL CONTROL AND AN INADVERTENT GROUND SWERVE; AND 
THE INSTRUCTOR PILOT'S (CFI'S) INADEQUATE SUPERVISION.  FACTORS RELATED TO 
THE ACCIDENT WERE:  THE CROSSWIND CONDITION, THE STUDENT PILOT'S LACK OF 
TOTAL EXPERIENCE, THE CFI'S LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN THE TYPE OF OPERATION, 
AND SOFT TERRAIN.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
