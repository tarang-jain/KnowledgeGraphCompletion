Analysis 
THE PVT PLT WAS COMPLETING A X-COUNTRY FLT WHEN THE ACCIDENT 
OCCURRED. HE SAID THAT HE HAD TO SWITCH RUNWAYS BECAUSE OF GUSTING 
AND VARIABLE WINDS. HE SELECTED RWY 21, A 3,100 X 40 FT ASPHALT RWY. THE 
TOUCHDOWN SEEMED NORMAL BUT THE PLT SAID HE HAD TO USE FULL RIGHT 
RUDDER THEN FULL LEFT RUDDER TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL. THE PLT 
SAID THAT A SUDDEN GUST FROM THE LEFT AND REAR OF THE ACFT BLEW DUST 
AND WEEDS ACROSS THE RWY AND LIFTED THE TAIL OF THE ACFT. THE ACFT CAME 
TO REST INVERTED AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE RWY.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
