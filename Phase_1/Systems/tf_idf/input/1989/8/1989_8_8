Analysis 
DURING APPROACH TO CHARLOTTE, THE MAIN GEAR WOULD NOT EXTEND. THE FLT 
DIVERTED TO GREENSBORO. THE RIGHT GEAR EVENTUALLY EXTENDED AFTER 
APPLYING EXTENSIVE G-FORCES, BUT THE LEFT GEAR WOULD NOT. AFTER 
LANDING, A 29-INCH WHEEL CHOCK WAS FOUND WEDGED BETWEEN THE RADIUS 
OF THE LEFT WHEEL WELL AND THE INBOARD WHEEL WHICH PREVENTED THE 
LEFT GEAR FROM FALLING DOWN. THE AIRPLANE HAD BEEN POSITIONED SEVERAL 
TIMES THE NIGHT BEFORE, AND THE MECHANICS RECALLED PLACING THE CHOCKS 
IN THE WHEEL WELL. AN A-CHECK, AND A WALK-AROUND INSPECTION, HAD BEEN 
COMPLETED PRIOR TO THE FLIGHT'S DEPARTURE FROM WASHINGTON. EACH 
INSPECTION REQUIRED AN INSPECTION OF THE WHEEL WELL AREA. THE FIRST 
OFFICER STATED THAT HE DIDN'T SEE THE CHOCK WHICH WAS MARKED WITH 
YELLOW REFLECTIVE TAPE. A FLASHLIGHT WAS USED DURING THE INSPECTION. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
FAILURE OF THE LINE MECHANIC, A CHECK MECHANIC, AND FIRST OFFICER TO 
IDENTIFY AND REMOVE THE WHEEL CHOCK FROM THE WHEEL WELL DURING THE 
REQUIRED INSPECTIONS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
