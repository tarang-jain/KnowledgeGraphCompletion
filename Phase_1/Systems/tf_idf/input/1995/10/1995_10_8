Factual Information
 On October 2, 1995, at 1730 central daylight time, a Socata    TB-9, N152ND, nose gear 
collapsed after the student pilot lost control of the airplane during the go phase of a touch and 
go landing at Pryor Field in Decatur, Alabama. The supervised solo flight operated under the 
provisions of 14 CFR Part 91 with no flight plan filed. Visual weather conditions prevailed at 
the time of the accident. The airplane was substantially damaged, and the student pilot was not 
injured. The flight departed Huntsville, Alabama, at 1700 hours. 
According to the student pilot, this was his second supervised solo flight. He had completed 
one touchdown, and was on the go phase of the first of a series of touch and go landings. As the 
airplane accelerated for the takeoff, the airplane veered off the left side of runway 18. When the 
student pilot attempted to regain control of the airplane, the throttle knob came off the throttle 
control lever. 
The  student pilot did not report a mechanical problem with the airplane. Examination of the 
airplane also failed to disclose a mechanical problem. This aircraft is equipped with an arm 
type throttle control lever; the throttle lever was still fully operational without the knob 
assembly.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
