Analysis 
The pilot reported that he activated the gear extension switch and visually confirmed that the 
main landing gear was extended. During the landing roll the main gear collapsed and the 
airplane veered off the runway and collided with a ditch. According to the pilot the touchdown 
was smooth and soft, but as he applied the brakes, he felt the nose rising and his seat getting 
lower to the ground. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of 
preimpact mechanical malfunction; the landing gear cycled normally.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the main landing gear retracted for undetermined reasons.

Factual Information
 On November 2, 1995, at 1000 eastern standard time, N2132Q, a Cessna 177RG, sustained 
substantial damage when the main landing gear collapsed during landing on runway 15 at 
College Park Airport, College Park, Maryland.  The certificated commercial pilot and the 
passenger were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was 
not filed.  The local personal flight was conducted under 14 CFR 91.
The pilot stated: "[The] Gear down switch was actuated and cycle appeared normal.  Visual 
gear down on both sides, right side was witnessed...smooth and soft flare, smooth main contact 
with ground.  Nice roll on all three gear, then upon application of brakes, felt a bump as if 
hitting a log on runway, then a sense of the nose rising, which was actually the seat getting 
lower and lower towards the ground.  Aircraft doing approx. 30 mph left runway...came to stop 
leaning to the left."
According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector, when the landing gear 
collapsed, the aircraft veered off the runway and collided with a ditch.  The aircraft was 
removed and sent to a repair facility for further examination.  The examination included 
cycling the gear.  The gear operated satisfactorily during the examination.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
