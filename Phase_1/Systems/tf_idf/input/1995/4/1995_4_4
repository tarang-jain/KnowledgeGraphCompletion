Analysis 
WITH WINDS FROM THE SOUTH AT 10-15 KNOTS, THE HELICOPTER DEPARTED TO 
THE NORTH, AND THE PILOT HAD DIFFICULTY MAINTAINING THE HELICOPTER IN A 
CLIMB ATTITUDE. DURING A RIGHT TURN TO AVOID TREES AND HOUSES, THE PILOT 
OBSERVED WIRES, AND CLIMBED IN AN ATTEMPT TO CLEAR THE WIRES. HOWEVER, 
THE TOP WIRE WAS STRUCK BY THE BOTTOM AFT PORTION OF THE LEFT SKID. 
DURING THE NIGHT PRECAUTIONARY LANDING TO A LARGE FIELD THE PILOT 
DETERMINED HE HAD 'STABILIZED' THE HELICOPTER ON AN EAST HEADING AND 
FORWARD MOVEMENT WAS STOPPED. DURING THE TOUCHDOWN WITH LATERAL 
MOVEMENT, THE HELICOPTER ROLLED OVER AND CAME TO REST ON ITS RIGHT 
SIDE. THE HELICOPTER WAS AT AN ESTIMATED GROSS WEIGHT O 4,120 POUNDS AT 
THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE GROSS WEIGHT WAS 4,150 
POUNDS. THE PILOT'S CURRENCY FOR CARRYING PASSENGERS AT NIGHT EXPIRED 
ON MARCH 11, 1995. A SUCCESSFUL ENGINE RUN WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN A TEST 
CELL AFTER THE ACCIDENT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S IMPROPER WIND EVALUATION, AND IMPROPER TOUCHDOWN 
PROCEDURE, RESULTING IN DYNAMIC ROLLOVER OF THE HELICOPTER. FACTORS 
WERE THE TAILWIND, DARK NIGHT, AND THE LACK OF RECENT EXPERIENCE AT 
NIGHT.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On April 1, 1995, approximately 2120 central standard time, a   Bell 206L-1 helicopter, 
N701EC, was substantially damaged during  a precautionary landing after impacting a power 
line near Flower Mound, Texas.  The airline transport rated pilot and three passengers received 
minor injuries, two passenger were seriously injured, and one passenger was fatally injured.  
The helicopter was being operated as a personal flight under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  The flight 
originated earlier in the day from Dallas Love Field (DAL), Dallas, Texas.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal night flight.  
The pilot reported the following information to the investigator-in-charge.  During a hovering 
turn to the north the pilot noted "excellent torque above 90 percent with good temp."  The 
helicopter took off from the Circle R Ranch to the north.  During the takeoff at approximately 
100 feet above ground level (AGL), torque was reduced to 85 percent for the climb.  The 
helicopter began to descend and power (collective) was increased to arrest the descent; 
however, the descent continued.  To avoid houses and trees, the pilot initiated a turn to the 
east.  As the pilot continued the turn towards the south over the Farm to Market (FM) 1171, he 
observed wires.  The pilot "pitched up" the helicopter and increased collective to clear the 
wires.  The pilot attempted to clear the wires; but, as the helicopter continued towards the 
south it struck the top wire.  During the attempted landing the pilot determined he had tail 
rotor control and "stabilized" on an east heading.  The pilot "believed" he had stopped forward 
movement.  During the "set down", the helicopter "pitched right and went over on its side."  
During the descent and attempted landing it appeared to the pilot as if the helicopter had 
"some power" and the collective was "not reacting or was weak."
The Care Flight pilots that responded to the accident reported in the enclosed statements that 
the winds were southerly at approximately 10-15 knots.
A witness who was located northeast of the crash site observed the helicopter over the highway.  
She estimated its height to be above the tree line and it appeared to be "spinning out of 
control."  She then observed the helicopter "dip" downward as it proceeded toward the 
southeast.  The helicopter then briefly gained altitude before going into a "sharp decline" from 
about halfway between the north fence line and the point of impact.  She reported the 
helicopter's lights were on and the "engine working."
A witness whose house the helicopter flew over reported he knew it was in trouble because the 
engine was "surging."
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
A review of the pilot's log book and helicopter's flight log revealed the pilot's last night flight 
was December 11, 1994.  Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 61.57d states no person may act as 
pilot in command of an aircraft carrying passengers during the period beginning 1 hour after 
sunset and ending 1 hour before sunrise (as published in the American Air Almanac) unless, 
within the preceding 90 days, that person has made at least three takeoffs and three landings 
to a full stop during that period in the category and class of aircraft to be used.  See the 
enclosed copies of the pilot log book and helicopter flight log. 
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
Page 4 of 6FTW95FA151
A review of the airframe and engine records did not reveal any   anomalies or uncorrected 
maintenance defects.  Weight and balance calculations were performed using data provided by 
the manufacturer.  An estimate of the weight of 4,120 pounds at the time of the accident places 
the helicopter below its maximum gross weight of 4,150 pounds.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The initial ground scar was on a measured magnetic heading of 100 degrees, 15 feet from the 
main wreckage.  A second ground scar was on a measured magnetic heading of 070 degrees at 
the main wreckage.  The helicopter came to rest on it's right side, on a measured magnetic 
heading of 050 degrees.
The main transmission and roof support beam was torn from the helicopter.  The tailboom was 
separated in two places and the engine remained partially attached by cables and oil/fuel/air 
lines.
A power line was found down 154 yards from the initial ground scar.  The wire was surveyed at 
30 feet above the ground.  Scratch marks were found on 18 inches of the bottom aft portion of 
the left skid.
Examination of the aircraft did not disclose any mechanical anomalies.  A successful engine 
run was accomplished in a test cell.  The power turbine governor was replaced for the engine 
run because of the impact damage it sustained. See the enclosed wreckage diagram for 
wreckage distribution details.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
