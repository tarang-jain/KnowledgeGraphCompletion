Analysis 
A WITNESS REPORTED THAT SHE OBSERVED THE AIRPLANE AS IT ENTERED THE 
TRAFFIC PATTERN. SHE DESCRIBED THE AIRPLANE BOUNCING AND ROLLING, AND 
THAT IT 'WOBBLED' FROM SIDE TO SIDE, THEN DESCEND ABRUPTLY TOWARD THE

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S POOR JUDGMENT IN ATTEMPTING TO LAND IN THE EXISTING WIND 
CONDITIONS. HIS LACK OF EXPERIENCE WAS A FACTOR.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On April 2, 1995, at 1208 central daylight time, a Maule M-5- 235C, N56349, operated by 
Robert W. Meyers, was destroyed when it impacted the terrain while landing at the Rush City 
Municipal Airport, Rush City, Minnesota.  The private pilot sustained fatal injuries.  The 
personal flight originated in St. Paul, Minnesota, and was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91 in 
visual meteorological conditions.  No flight plan was filed.
A witness reported that she observed the accident airplane as it entered the traffic pattern at 
the Rush City Municipal Airport.  She described the airplane bouncing and rolling and reported 
that it "wobbled" from side to side then descended abruptly toward the airport.
The airport manager estimated the winds were "from the southeast and gusting to about thirty 
knots" at the time of the accident.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
The pilot was issued a private pilot certificate on October 7, 1994, seven months prior to the 
accident.  At the time of application the pilot listed 64.7 total flight hours.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The NTSB on-scene investigation began about 0900 on April 3, 1995.  The wreckage was 
located approximately midfield, 75 yards west of runway 15.  The wreckage path was located on 
a heading of 300 degrees.  Two lateral slashes in the soil and windscreen fragments preceded 
the main impact crater.  The crater was approximately twelve inches deep.  Impressions of the 
wing leading edges extended north and south from the main crater.  Fragments of a red 
navigation light were located on the north side of the crater.  The main wreckage was located 
approximately 30 feet beyond the crater on a heading of 160 degrees.
The entire airplane, with the exception of the outer wings, was burned and charred.  The 
leading edges of the wings were compressed at an angle corresponding to a pitch attitude of 135 
degrees nose down.  The fuselage tubing in the vicinity of the wing carry through exhibited 
fractured tubing and compression damage.  The engine mount and forward fuselage were 
compressed in the downward direction.  Inspection of the airframe, engine controls, and flight 
control continuity revealed no evidence of preimpact malfunction.
Both blades of the propeller exhibited rotational scoring, torsional bending, and leading edge 
damage.  The tip of one blade was separated.  The fragment was discovered in one of the 
slashes east of the impact crater. 
The engine exhibited minor impact damage and burning.  Compression was verified in all 
cylinders and continuity of the accessories was established.  The distributer gear in the 
magneto was melted and the magneto could not be tested.  The spark plugs exhibited normal 
wear.  Examination of the carburetor revealed melting to the solder in the brass float and no 
evidence of malfunction.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
Autopsy of the pilot was conducted April 3, 1995, at the Regina Medical Center, 1175 Nininger 
Road, Hastings, Minnesota 55033.  The results of FAA toxicological testing were negative for 
all tests conducted except for 0.021 (ug/ml, ug/g) Chlorpheniramine and 0.098 (ug/ml, ug/g) 
Page 4 of 6CHI95FA114
Diphenhydramine detected in the blood specimen.  Chlorpheniramine and Diphenhydramine 
were detected in the urine specimen.  
According to a NTSB National Resource Specialist, the therapeutic level for Diphenhydramine 
is approximately .100 (ug/ml, ug/g) and the therapeutic level for Chlorpheniramine is .016 to 
.070 (ug/ml, ug/g).  Chlorpheniramine and Diphenhydramine are listed in the Physicians' 
Desk Reference as active ingredients in many nonprescription cold and allergy medications.
ADDITIONAL DATA/INFORMATION
Following the on-scene portion of the investigation, the wreckage was released to Mr. Howard 
Hanson, the manager of the Rush City Municipal Airport.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
