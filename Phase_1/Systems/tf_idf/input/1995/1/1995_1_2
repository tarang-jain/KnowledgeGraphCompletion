Substantial
Defining Event:

Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE AIRPLANE STALLED WHILE THE PRIVATE PILOT WAS ATTEMPTING A TAKEOFF 
FROM A DIRT AIRSTRIP WITH FROST ON ITS WING. THE AIRPLANE CLIMBED OUT OF 
GROUND EFFECT WITHOUT SUFFICIENT FLYING SPEED AND THE PILOT RAISED THE 
FLAPS PREMATURELY. THE AIRPLANE STALLED AND IMPACTED THE GROUND. THE 
PILOT HAD NOT SLEPT FOR OVER 24 HOURS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO ATTAIN PROPER LIFTOFF SPEED RESULTING IN AN 
INADVERTENT STALL AND THE FAILURE TO REMOVE FROST FROM THE WING. A 
FACTOR WAS FATIGUE.

Factual Information
 On January 1, 1995, at 0735 mountain standard time, a Cessna 177B, N30898, was 
substantially damaged during takeoff near Torreon, New Mexico.  The private pilot and his 
passanger were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the cross country 
flight.
The enclosed Pilot/Operator report stated the following information.  The pilot had been 
awake for "over 24 hours."  The weather was good for flying, but very cold.  "The dirt runway 
was frozen rock hard."  The pilot performed a soft field takeoff in an attempt to protect his nose 
gear from the rough frozen dirt runway.  This was done by using flaps and by rotating the front 
landing gear off the ground as soon as possible on the takeoff roll.  The aircraft lifted into the 
air and the pilot continued maintaining the aircraft in this attitude above ground effect without 
allowing the aircraft to accelerate to flying speed.  At this same monent, the pilot raised his 
flaps.  With flaps retracting "lift was lost," and the airplane subsequently stalled, impacting the 
ground.
The pilot reported to the NTSB investigator-in-charge, that after the accident, he examined the 
upper wing surface much more closely.  He discovered that there was a thin "uniform 
pockmark matrix" of frost over most of the wing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
