Factual Information
 On May 1, 1995, at 1335 central daylight time, a Cessna 152, N47331, registered to the DuPage 
Airport Authority of West Chicago, Illinois, and operated by a student pilot, exited runway 10 
(4,751' x 75' dry/asphalt) at Dupage Airport, West Chicago, Illinois, and sustained substantial 
damage when it nosed over.  The pilot reported no injuries.  The 14 CFR Part 91 solo 
instructional flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions.  A VFR flight plan was on 
file.  The flight departed Peoria, Illinois, at 1206.  
The student pilot reported in his written statement that after a go around from his first 
approach, he encountered a crosswind condition on his second approach.  He was concerned 
that a "violent" correction would flip the aircraft over.  On roll out, the airplane exited the 
runway to the right, and nosed over after the nose landing gear sank into the mud.  Seven 
minutes after the accident, DuPage Tower was reporting wind conditions, 050 degrees at 15 
knots, gusts to 20 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
