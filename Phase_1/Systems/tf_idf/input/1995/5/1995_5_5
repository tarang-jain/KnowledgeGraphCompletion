Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE PILOT REPORTED THAT WHILE MAKING A RIGHT CLIMBING TURN AFTER 
TAKEOFF, APPROXIMATELY 500 FEET AGL, THE AIRPLANE STARTED TO BANK TO THE 
LEFT.  DESPITE HIS USE OF FULL RIGHT RUDDER, HE WAS UNABLE TO REGAIN 
CONTROL.  ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, 'THE PLANE KEPT TIGHTENING UP INTO A 
LEFT FLAT SPIRAL TO THE GROUND.'  THE AIRPLANE HAD LEXAN DOORS INSTALLED 
TO ENCLOSE THE COCKPIT/CABIN AREA.  THE DOORS WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE 
ORIGINAL DESIGN OF THIS KIT AIRPLANE, BUT WERE SUBSEQUENTLY MADE 
AVAILABLE AS A STANDARD OR OPTIONAL FEATURE, DEPENDING ON THE MODEL. 
THE MANUFACTURER STATED THAT WHEN THE DOORS ARE INSTALLED, THE 
AIRPLANE BECOMES RUDDER DOMINANT AND SENSITIVE AND THAT PILOTS MUST 
NOT TAKE THEIR FEET OFF THE RUDDER PEDALS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
INADEQUATE DIRECTIONAL STABILITY OF THE AIRCRAFT (DUE TO INSTALLATION OF 
LEXAN COCKPIT ENCLOSURE DOORS), WHICH PRECIPITATED A LOSS OF 
DIRECTIONAL CONTROL.

Factual Information
 On May 2, 1995, at 1550 eastern daylight time, an ultralight Challenger, N100GB, was 
destroyed when it impacted trees shortly after taking off from a private grass strip in 
Bridgeport, Michigan. The pilot, who was not injured, reported a loss of control.  The local 14 
CFR Part 91 flight operated without flight plan in visual meteorological conditions. 
According to the pilot, while making a right climbing turn after takeoff, at approximately 500 
feet above the ground, the airplane started to bank to the left.  The pilot stated despite his use 
of full right rudder, the banking continued.  He continued to stated, "The plane kept tightening 
up into a left flat spiral to the ground."  
The pilot had approximately 4 hours of flight time in the Challenger.  The optional kit doors 
were installed on the ultralight during all four hours of flight time.
In a telephone interview, the pilot stated that he had experienced this same type of left banking 
once before while landing.  In that incident he was able to regain control of the ultralight.  The 
pilot stated he believes that the ailerons of the Challenger are almost non-effective and a pilot 
needs to use the rudder more then in any other airplane that he has ever flown before.  He 
stated that the rudder has to be used to make the Challenger turn.
The Chief Engineer with Popular Flying Association in the United Kingdom, stated in a 
telephone interview that the Challenger is directionally unstable when the doors are installed.  
As a result, several modifications to the Challenger are mandatory before their operation is 
permitted in the United Kingdom.  The modification consists of the installation of a larger tail 
fin, rudder, and reinforcements.
This investigator has spoken to the President of the Quad City Ultralight Aircraft Corporation, 
the Challenger manufacturer, on several occasions concerning the flight characteristics of the 
Challenger when the doors are installed.  In a written statement, the president stated the 
Challenger II was designed in 1984 as a two place ultralight trainer to be used by Challenger 
dealers to train their customers to fly the single seat Challenger ultralight.  The president 
stated, "We never intended [the Challenger] to have doors."  The doors were designed by a 
Challenger dealer in Canada.  A set of these doors were purchased by Quad City Ultralight 
Aircraft Corporation and installed.  The president stated, "We liked the doors for winter flying 
and noticed no stability problems other than they made the plane more rudder dominated; i.e., 
you had to steer more with your feet than previously."   Because of the large request, Quad City 
Ultralight Aircraft Corporation started offering the doors in kit form to their customers and 
dealers.
When questioned about the directional stability of the Challenger when the doors are installed, 
the president stated he believes the problem lies in the inexperience of the pilots.  He stated the 
Challenger is a rudder dominant and sensitive airplane.  He continued to stated that when the 
doors are installed, a pilot can not take his feet off the rudder pedals.  The president stated that 
inexperienced pilots find it difficult to adapt to this kind of flying.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
