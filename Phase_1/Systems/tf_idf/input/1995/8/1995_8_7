Analysis 
During landing rollout the airplane veered off the left side of runway 16R, ground looped, and 
the lower right wing contacted the ground.  According to the pilot, he was unable to keep his 
airplane on the runway because a gusty crosswind condition existed.  The pilot said he had a 
total of 9.3 hours of pilot-in-command flying experience in the airplane.  Van Nuys Airport 
reported its local wind was from 100 to 110 degrees, at 10 knots. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing rollout.  Factors which 
contributed to the loss of control were: the pilot's total lack of experience landing the 
conventional gear airplane in a crosswind condition, and the crosswind.

Federal Aviation Administration on April 30, 1996.   Regarding circumstances of the accident, 
on May 15, 1996, the pilot reported to the Safety Board that during rollout he was unable to

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
