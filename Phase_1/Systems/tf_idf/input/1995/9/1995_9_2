Analysis 
THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE LEFT FUEL GAGE WAS NOT WORKING AND BOTH 
FUEL TANKS WERE FULL PRIOR TO DEPARTURE.  HE DID NOT LEAN THE ENGINE 
DURING THE 2.7 HOUR FLIGHT.  THE PILOT INITIATED A GO-AROUND DURING AN 
ATTEMPTED LANDING.  WHEN THE AIRPLANE WAS AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 50 
FEET, THE ENGINE LOST POWER.  THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO LAND THE AIRPLANE 
ON THE REMAINING RUNWAY.  THE AIRPLANE DEPARTED THE RUNWAY AT THE 
DEPARTURE END AND 'SLID INTO THE TREES.'  EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE 
REVEALED NO USABLE FUEL REMAINED IN THE FUEL TANKS AND THE FUEL LINES 
WERE EMPTY.  ABOUT 3/8 INCH OF FUEL REMAINED IN THE CARBURETOR BOWL.  A 
FUEL LINE FITTING WAS LEAKING NEAR THE FUEL PUMP. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's operation of the airplane with an inoperative fuel gage and the leaking fuel line 
fitting, which resulted in fuel exhaustion, loss of engine power, and a forced landing.  The 
inoperative fuel gage was a related factor.

Factual Information
 On September 1, 1995, at 1115 eastern daylight time, a Grumman AA-5, N9528L, was 
destroyed when it impacted the terrain during an attempted go around at the Welke Airport, 
Saint James, Michigan.  The private pilot and one passenger reported minor injuries.  The 
personal flight originated in Three Rivers, Michigan, about 0830, and was conducted under 14 
CFR Part 91 in visual meteorological conditions.  No flight plan was filed.
The pilot reported that the left fuel gage was not working and both fuel tanks were full prior to 
departure.  He did not lean the engine during the flight and used fuel from the right tank for 
approximately one hour.  He switched to the left tank for the remaining 1.7 hours of the flight.  
The pilot initiated a go around during an attempted landing on runway 17.  When the airplane 
was at an altitude of about 50 feet, the engine lost power.  The pilot attempted to land the 
airplane on the remaining runway.  The airplane departed the runway at the departure end and 
"slid into the trees."
Examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector revealed 
both fuel tanks were ruptured.  A "trace" of fuel remained in the right tank. The left tank was 
empty.  No fuel remained in the fuel lines and about 3/8 inch of fuel remained in the 
carburetor bowl.  An inspection cover in the outboard section of the left fuel tank and the quick 
drain in the right fuel tank were stained a red color.  The quick drain was in the closed position.  
He reported the airplane would normally have approximately 4 hours of usable fuel.
An aircraft inspector who examined the airplane reported that a fuel line fitting was leaking 
near the fuel pump.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
