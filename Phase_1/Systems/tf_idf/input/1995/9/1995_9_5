Analysis 
THE PILOT WAS SPRAYING A TOMATO FIELD WHEN A STRONG VIBRATION STARTED 
THROUGH THE AIRFRAME, FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY A SEVERE YAW. PEDAL 
INPUT HAD NO EFFECT ON THE YAW AND THE HELICOPTER BEGAN TO SPIN. THE 
PILOT REDUCED POWER AND LOWERED THE COLLECTIVE TO STOP THE YAW AND 
THE HELICOPTER LANDED HARD. AN FAA AIRWORTHINESS INSPECTOR EXAMINED 
THE WRECKAGE AT THE ACCIDENT SITE. ONE TAIL ROTOR BLADE WAS MISSING AND 
SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND ABOUT 100 FEET AWAY. THE INSPECTOR REPORTED THAT 
THE TENSION TORSION (TT) PLATES OF THE SEPARATED BLADE WERE BROKEN AT 
THE HUB ATTACH BOLTS. NO LEADING EDGE DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED ON THE 
BLADE. THE FRACTURED TT PLATES WERE SENT TO THE NTSB LAB WHERE 
REPRESENTATIVE PLATE FRACTURES WERE SELECTED FOR DETAILED 
EXAMINATION. FEATURES TYPICAL OF PROGRESSIVE FATIGUE CRACKING WERE 
OBSERVED. A MATERIAL ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE STRAPS WERE MADE FROM 
THE MANUFACTURER'S SPECIFIED MATERIAL. NO EVIDENCE OF FOREIGN ELEMENT 
CONTAMINATION WAS FOUND ON THE FRACTURE FACES. THE TAIL ROTOR TT BAR 
HAS A 12,500-HOUR LIFE LIMIT AND THE FRACTURED TT BAR HAD ACCUMULATED A 
TOTAL TIME IN SERVICE OF 3,710 HOURS. NO PRIOR INCIDENTS WERE FOUND IN 
THE FAA SERVICE DIFFICULTY REPORT DATA BASE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the fatigue failure of the tail rotor tension torsion bar plates.

Factual Information
 On September 1, 1995, at 0830 hours Pacific daylight time, a Hiller UH-12E, N4027D, made a 
hard landing following the loss of a tail rotor blade while applying chemicals to a field near Dos 
Palos, California.  The helicopter was owned and operated by Bettencourt Flying Service, Inc., 
of Delhi, California, and was on a local area aerial application flight under 14 CFR Part 137.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed.  The 
helicopter sustained substantial damage.  The certificated airline transport pilot, the sole 
occupant, was not injured.  The flight originated at Delhi, California, on the day of the accident 
at 0600 hours.
The pilot reported that he was spraying pesticides on a tomato field when a strong vibration 
started through the airframe, followed immediately by a severe yaw.  The pilot was unable to 
control the yaw with pedal input and the helicopter began to spin.  He reduced power and 
lowered the collective to stop the yaw and the helicopter landed hard.  The pilot stated that 
examination of the helicopter after the accident revealed one tail rotor blade was missing.
An FAA airworthiness inspector from the Fresno, California, Flight Standards District Office, 
examined the helicopter wreckage at the accident site.  The missing tail rotor blade was found 
about 100 feet from the helicopter wreckage.  The inspector reported that the tension torsion 
(TT) plates of the separated blade were broken at the hub attach bolts.  No leading edge 
damage was observed on the blade.
The fractured TT plates were sent to the Safety Board's metallurgical laboratory in Washington, 
D. C., for examination.  A copy of the report is attached.  According to the report, 
representative fractures were selected for detailed examination.  Features typical of progressive 
fatigue cracking were observed.  A material analysis revealed that the straps were made from 
the manufacturer's specified material.  No evidence of foreign element contamination was 
found on the fracture faces.
Review of the Hiller component replacement/overhaul schedule revealed that the tail rotor TT 
bar has a 12,500-hour life limit.  The helicopter maintenance records denote that the fractured 
TT bar had accumulated a total time in service of 3,710 hours.
The FAA Service Difficulty Report data base was examined for records of prior TT bar failures.  
No prior incidents were found.  Several helicopter repair stations were queried and they 
reported no knowledge of prior TT bar failures.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
