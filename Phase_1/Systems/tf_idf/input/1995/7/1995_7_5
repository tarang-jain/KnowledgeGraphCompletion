Analysis 
WHILE IN THE INITIAL TAKEOFF CLIMB FOR A 10-MILE FLIGHT TO ANOTHER 
AIRPORT, THE PILOT PERCEIVED A LOSS OF ENGINE POWER AND MANEUVERED TO 
RETURN TO THE AIRPORT. THE AIRCRAFT HAD INSUFFICIENT ALTITUDE TO REACH 
THE RUNWAY AND STRUCK POWER LINES WHILE TURNING TOWARDS THE AIRPORT. 
RESPONDING FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL REPORTED THAT THE RIGHT WING 
CONTAINED NO FUEL AND THE LEFT TANK CONTAINED VERY LITTLE FUEL. AN FAA 
INSPECTOR EXAMINED THE AIRCRAFT AND REPORTED THAT THE RIGHT WING FUEL 
TANK CONTAINED LESS THAN 1 GALLON, AND THE LEFT TANK CONTAINED ABOUT 5 
GALLONS. THE FUEL SELECTOR WAS POSITIONED BETWEEN THE LEFT AND RIGHT 
TANKS. HE ALSO REPORTED THAT NO FUEL WAS AVAILABLE AT THE CARMEL VALLEY 
AIRPORT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
fuel starvation due to the pilot's inadequate preflight preparation in that he failed to position 
the fuel selector to a tank known to contain fuel.

Factual Information
 On July 1, 1995, at 0945 hours Pacific daylight time, a Piper PA28-161, N8399T, struck power 
lines during an attempted return to airport maneuver at Carmel Valley Airport, Carmel Valley, 
California.  The maneuver was initiated by the pilot because of a perceived loss of engine power 
in the takeoff initial climb.  The airplane was destroyed.  The certificated private pilot and his 
passenger were seriously injured.  The flight was originating at the time of the accident for a 
destination of Monterey Peninsula Airport, Monterey, California.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed.
According to the pilot's written report, he stated that he performed a preflight inspection and 
that the aircraft had 7 gallons of fuel.  After taking off and reaching an altitude of 450 feet agl, 
the airplane lost engine power.  The pilot initiated an immediate right turn towards the airport.  
After completing the emergency checklist, the pilot realized that the airplane would not glide 
back to the airport.  He then chose an area away from people and structures for an emergency 
landing.  After landing, the pilot shut off the master switch and waited for emergency 
personnel.
Responding fire department personnel reported that the right wing fuel tank contained no fuel.  
The left wing tank "contained very little fuel."
A Federal Aviation Administration inspector from the San Jose, California, Flight Standards 
District Office, examined the aircraft.  He reported that the amount of fuel in each tank was 
measured at less than 1 gallon in the right tank and about 5 gallons in the left.  The fuel selector 
was found positioned between the left and right fuel tank.  The inspector also reported that no 
fuel is available at the Carmel Valley Airport.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
