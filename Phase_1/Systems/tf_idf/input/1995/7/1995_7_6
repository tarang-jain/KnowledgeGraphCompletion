Factual Information
 On July 1, 1995, at 1435 hours mountain standard time, a Piper PA-22-160, N2820Z, collided 
with trees during a forced landing following takeoff at Payson, Arizona.  The forced landing was 
precipitated by a loss of engine power in the takeoff initial climb.  The aircraft was owned and 
operated by the pilot, and was beginning a personal cross-country flight to Glendale, Arizona.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time.  The aircraft sustained substantial 
damage.  The certificated private pilot and his one passenger sustained minor injuries.  The 
flight was originating at the time of the accident.
The pilot reported that he purchased 20 gallons of fuel from the airport prior to departure.  
Responding fire department personnel stated that they turned off the fuel valve to control a 
fuel line leak after the accident.
An FAA inspector from the Scottsdale, Arizona, Flight Standards District Office examined the 
aircraft and reported finding no discrepancies.  Fuel samples from the aircraft tanks and 
carburetor, and from the airport fuel truck used to refuel the aircraft, were taken for laboratory 
analysis.  According to the laboratory report, the fuel samples tested were consistent with 
aviation gasoline.  No significant water or other contaminants were found.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
