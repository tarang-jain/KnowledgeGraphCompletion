Factual Information
 On December 1, 1995, about 1700 eastern standard time, a Cessna 150M, N8779U, collided 
with a tree stump during a forced landing near Beaufort, South Carolina. The aircraft was 
operated by Master Aviation under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91, and visual flight rules. A 
flight plan was not filed for the instructional flight. There were no injuries to the commercial 
flight instructor, nor the student, and the aircraft was substantially damaged. The flight 
departed Hilton Head, South Carolina, at 1600 on the same day.
     The pilot reported that he fueled the airplane at Hilton Head, prior to takeoff, with six 
gallons of aviation gasoline. All six gallons were added to the right tank. About ten minutes 
after refueling, the student pilot performed a pre-flight inspection, that included sampling the 
fuel from the tank drains. Shortly after take off, while the aircraft was in cruise flight, the 
engine quit. The instructor executed a forced landing. On landing roll, the aircraft struck a tree 
stump, twisting the fuselage, and buckling the tail cone. The pilot stated that after the forced 
landing, he drained fuel from the right wing and the sump. According to him, both samples 
contained water. Upon further examination of the engine, no other engine problems were 
found.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
