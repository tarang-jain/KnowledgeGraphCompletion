Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
HALLETT, OK
Accident Number:
FTW96FA058
Date & Time:
12/02/1995, 0141 CST 
Registration:
N98003
Aircraft:
Cessna 172P
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
3 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor, his student, and a passenger departed Stillwater Municipal Airport at 
0120 for a night instructional cross country flight. They flew east climbing to 3,500 feet MSL 
and parallel to the Cimarron Turnpike. The Cimarron Turnpike, elevation 980 feet, is a 4 lane 
white cement highway with a 10 foot wide grass strip separating the east and westbound lanes. 
The spacing of the eastbound traffic, at that time of night, was 5 to 8 miles apart and the moon 
was approximately 85% full. At 0138:20, radar showed the airplane flying a descending box 
pattern over the turnpike culminating with impacting the 7/16 inch stainless steel static wires 
which were 64 feet over the turnpike. The airplane impacted on the eastbound lanes and slid 
east, 3 feet north of the center line and exactly parallel to it for a 162 feet. Moments before the 
impact, witnesses 'noticed a bright, single light practically directly behind' them. Because no 
other vehicles arrived at the accident scene for approximately 5 minutes, they believe the bright 
light they saw was that of the airplane. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's intentional low altitude flight maneuver. Factors were the static wire and 
the bright night condition.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On December 2, 1995, at 0141 central standard time, a Cessna 172P, N98003, was destroyed 
upon impact with static wires near Hallett, Oklahoma.  The flight instructor, the commercial 
pilot rated student, and the passenger were fatally injured.  The aircraft was registered to 
Christiansen Aviation, Inc. and was being operated by Spartan School of Aeronautics of Tulsa, 
Oklahoma, under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  The flight originated from Stillwater Municipal Airport 
near Stillwater, Oklahoma, at 0120, with Tulsa, Oklahoma, as its intended destination.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed for the night cross country dual instructional flight for 
which a flight plan was not filed.
The first leg of the night cross training flight began with the filing of a VFR flight plan with 
McAlester AFSS at approximately 2000 on the evening of December 1, 1995.  The flight plan 
was opened with McAlester AFSS at 2035 and the airplane proceeded from Richard Lloyd 
Jones Jr. Airport (commonly known by the old name of Riverside Airport) to Stillwater 
Municipal Airport.  At approximately 2105, the flight instructor called McAlester AFSS and 
closed their flight plan.  Approximately 15 minutes later the airplane was on the ground and the 
fuel tanks were immediately topped off. 
The second leg of the flight began at approximately 0120 on December 2, 1995 with no flight 
plan filed.  The first radar contact with the accident aircraft was due east of Stillwater 
Municipal Airport at 0125 at 2,600 feet MSL which is approximately 1,600 feet above the 
ground.  Approximately two minutes later the aircraft leveled off at 3,500 feet MSL and 
continued eastbound for 12 to 13 minutes.  For the last 6 minutes of this time period, the 
aircraft was flying parallel to and within 1/2 mile to the south of the Cimarron Turnpike.      
The Cimarron Turnpike is a 4 lane white cement highway with a 10 foot wide grass strip 
separating the east and westbound lanes.  The vehicle traffic volume in the eastbound lanes at 
that time of night would space the surface vehicles at an estimated 5 to 8 miles apart (see 
enclosed documentation).  The moon on December 2, 1995 was approximately 85% full which 
contributed to making a bright clear night.
ATC radar data showed that, at 0138:20, the aircraft made at left turn northbound and, as it 
crossed over the Cimarron Turnpike, began to descend.  The aircraft's turn continued until a 
westbound heading was established.  The last radar contact was made at 0140:04 and the 
airplane had descended to 1,800 feet MSL or approximately 800 feet above the ground.
Witnesses in an automobile driving east on the Cimarron Turnpike during this time period 
"noticed a bright, single light practically directly behind" them.  The driver of the car 
"wondered if the light may have been a motorcycle with it's bright light on."  Later, after she 
had time to think about the events, she decided that it was not a motorcycle because "1) it was 
too large and too bright, and 2) it was placed too high off the ground."
The above mentioned witnesses next observed "a large fire ball rising in the air 100 to 200 
yards behind" them.  The witnesses turned their car around and drove to the accident scene to 
discover that an airplane was on fire.  The witnesses reported that they stood near the burning 
airplane "for probably 5 minutes before anyone else appeared."  The witnesses further reported 
that they believed the bright light they  saw earlier "could have been the airplane's landing 
lights behind us."

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
A 7/16 inch stainless steel static wire, sixty-four feet off of the ground, was found separated 
approximately 132 feet from the accident site. The north end of  the wire exhibited black and 
reddish brown paint transfers.  The south end of the wire was examined later, after the power 
company completed repairs.  The south end also exhibited black and reddish brown paint 
transfers. The power company noted that a power interruption occurred at 0141:25 on the day 
of the accident.    
The aircraft impacted on the eastbound lanes of the Cimarron Turnpike.  Ground scars were 
noted 3 feet north of the turnpike centerline and parallel to it for a 162 feet.  The airplane came 
to rest on a measured magnetic heading of 360 degrees at mile marker 52.9.  
All primary and secondary controls were accounted for in the wreckage.  According to the 
aircraft recovery personnel, the control cables were cut in the salvage operation.  Control cable 
continuity was established to all flight surfaces from the cut cable ends.  The left outboard wing 
section exhibited aft, downward crushing, and the right wing leading edge exhibited 
symmetrical aft crushing.
Examination of the engine revealed no anomalies which could have affected it's performance.  
Twenty inches were melted from one propeller blade and the other exhibited jagged leading 
edge damage, chordwise scoring, and "S" twisting.  The cabin environment was consumed by 
the post crash fire.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
Autopsies and toxicological tests were ordered and performed on both pilots.  The autopsies 
were performed by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner at Tulsa, Oklahoma, on December 
27, 1995.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
