CHI95LA080
Date & Time:
02/03/1995, 0927 MST 
Registration:
N3633Q
Aircraft:
SCHWEIZER G-164B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Positioning
Analysis 
THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE EXPERIENCED ENGINE POWER FLUCTUATIONS.  
WHEN HE SCANNED THE ENGINE GAUGES, HE OBSERVED NO FUEL PRESSURE 
INDICATION.  HE SET UP FOR A FORCED LANDING, AND THE ENGINE LOST POWER.  
HE MANEUVERED OVER A SET OF POWERLINES AND THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER 
DURING THE LANDING ATTEMPT, SUSTAINING SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.  INSPECTION 
OF THE AIRPLANE REVEALED THAT THERE WAS SUFFICIENT FUEL ON BOARD, THE 
GRAVITY FEED FUEL FLOW TO THE FIREWALL WAS VERIFIED, AND THE VENT 
SYSTEM WAS CHECKED. EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE AND LOW PRESSURE FUEL 
PUMP REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF PREIMPACT MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Loss of engine power due to undetermined reasons.

Factual Information
 On February 3, 1995, at 0927 mountain standard time, a Schweizer G-164B airplane, N3633Q, 
operated by Frank R. Martin, sustained substantial damage when it nosed over during a forced 
landing near Brule, Nebraska.  The commercial pilot reported no injuries. The positioning 
flight, conducted under 14 CFR Part 91, departed Hershey, Nebraska, about 0900, with a 
planned destination of Kimball, Nebraska.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no 
flight plan was filed.
The pilot reported that the winds at the time of the accident were from the northwest at 25 
gusting to 30 knots.  He experienced engine power fluctuations.  When he scanned the engine 
gauges, he observed no fuel pressure indication.  He reported the gas generator was fluctuating 
and the turbine temperature was "OK."  He set up for a forced landing, and the engine lost 
power.  He maneuvered over a set of powerlines and the airplane nosed over during the 
landing attempt, sustaining substantial damage.
The wreckage was examined by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airworthiness 
Inspector.  He reported that the wreckage was moved prior to his arrival.  Sufficient fuel was on 
board, gravity feed fuel flow to the firewall was verified, and the vent system was checked.  He 
reported no evidence of preimpact airframe malfunction.
The engine was transported to Dallas, Texas, and examined.  The FAA Aviation Safety 
Inspector, who observed the examination, reported significant impact damage, minor 
rotational damage, and no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunction.  The low pressure 
fuel pump exhibited "major" impact damage and could not be tested.  Partial disassembly 
revealed no internal damage.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
