Part 91: General Aviation - Business
Analysis 
ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS (VMC) WERE 
FORECAST FOR BOTH HIS DESTINATION, GUNNISON, CO AND HIS ALTERNATE, 
MONTROSE, CO. DURING FLIGHT HE DETERMINED THAT THE HEAD WINDS WERE 
STRONGER THAN FORECAST RESULTING IN INCREASED FUEL USAGE. HE DECIDED 
TO CONTINUE TO GUNNISON BASED ON INFLIGHT INFORMATION GIVEN TO HIM 
THAT VMC PREVAILED. ARRIVING IN GUNNISON, INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL 
CONDITIONS (IMC) EXISTED, AND THE PILOT MADE AN ILS APPROACH. THE 
APPROACH WAS MISSED AND HE DIVERTED TO HIS ALTERNATE, MONTROSE. EN 
ROUTE THE PILOT ADVISED ATC HE WAS LOW ON FUEL. HE CROSSFED THE LEFT 
ENGINE FROM THE RIGHT FUEL TANK BECAUSE THE LEFT TANK WAS EMPTY. THE 
PILOT MADE AN ILS APPROACH TO MONTROSE. AT DECISION HEIGHT, THE RUNWAY 
ENVIRONMENT WAS NOT IN SIGHT. BECAUSE OF THE CRITICAL FUEL STATE, POOR 
WEATHER CONDITIONS, AND SURROUNDING HIGH TERRAIN, THE PILOT ELECTED 
TO LAND IN A FIELD HE HAD SIGHTED. THE AIRPLANE TOUCHED DOWN IN MUD AND 
NOSED OVER. OCCASIONAL IFR CONDITIONS AND MOUNTAIN OBSCURATION FOR 
THE ACCIDENT VICINITY WERE FORECAST IN PERTINENT AIRMETS PRIOR TO AND 
DURING THE FLIGHT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO REFUEL THE AIRPLANE RESULTING IN A FORCED LANDING. 
THE ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE FACTORS.

Factual Information
 On March 1, 1995, at approximately 1040 mountain standard time (all times are mountain 
standard time unless otherwise noted), a Beech 58P, N208DK, was destroyed when it impacted 
terrain during a landing approach at Montrose, Colorado.  The private pilot-in- command and 
commercial rated pilot/passenger were seriously injured.  Instrument meteorological 
conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed.  The 
business flight, conducted under Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91, originated at 
Fort Worth, Texas, at 0600.
The following is based on written pilot statements submitted along with the pilot/operator 
report.  The pilot and his passenger obtained several independent weather briefings and filed 
an IFR plan and departed Fort Worth, Texas.  Visual meteorological conditions were forecasted 
for both Gunnison and Montrose, Colorado, their destination and alternate, respectively. 
The pilot stated that while en route, it was determined that head winds had become stronger 
than forecasted; resulting in increased fuel consumption.  The pilot made the decision to 
continue to Gunnison.  He based this decision on inflight information given to him "in general 
terms"of the prevailing visual meteorological conditions that reportedly existed at his 
destination.
Upon arriving in the Gunnison area, the sky was obscured and it was snowing.  The pilot 
executed an instrument landing system  approach to runway 6.  At decision height, the pilot 
made a missed approach because he was unable to visually acquire the runway environment.  It 
was determined that sufficient fuel remained to divert to his alternate airport, 45 miles to the 
west.  En route, to Montrose, however, the pilot advised Denver Air Route Traffic Control 
Center (ARTCC) that he was low on fuel.
He was forced to crossfeed the left engine from the right fuel tank because the left tank was 
empty.
An ILS approach was executed to runway 17 at Montrose and at decision height, the runway 
environment was not in sight.  Aware of his fuel state, the poor weather conditions, and 
surrounding high terrain, the pilot elected to land the airplane in a field. The airplane touched 
down in mud and nosed over And came to rerst 1/4 mile east-northeast of runway 17.
As of the writing of this report, the air traffic report requested has not been recieved.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
