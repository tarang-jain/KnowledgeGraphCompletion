Factual Information
 On March 3, 1995, at 1728 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-28- 140, N7498R was 
substantially damaged following a collision with light poles and street signs during a forced 
landing attempt to a highway near Charleston, South Carolina. The commercial pilot and his 
passenger received minor injuries in the accident. The aircraft was being operated under the 
provisions of 14 CFR Part 91 by the pilot. Visual meteorological conditions existed at the time 
of the accident, and no flight plan had been filed for the flight. The flight departed Elizabeth 
City, North Carolina at 1430, and was destined for Savannah, Georgia at the time of the 
accident.
The pilot reported that he obtained fuel in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. He reported that he 
burned about 10 gallons of fuel from the right tank and then switched fuel tanks. After flying 
for about one hour and burning about 10 gallons of fuel from the left tank, the aircraft engine 
began to run rough. He stated that the first indication of trouble was an unusual noise in the 
engine compartment, followed by a drop in fuel pressure. He stated that after the fuel pressure 
dropped, and the engine began to run rough, he switched to the right fuel tank. He stated that 
the engine continued to run rough, and that the engine eventually lost all power. He attempted 
an emergency landing on a highway. He stated that he struck some trees, and crashed into the 
terrain during the final descent into the highway.  
Examination of the aircraft fuel selector valve revealed that the detent washer was broken and 
one fourth of the washer was missing. When the selector was rotated, there were no noticeable 
detents, and the selector was easily rotated to an in-between tanks "off" position.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
