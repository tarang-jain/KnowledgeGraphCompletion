Analysis   
While in cruise flight, the pilot became ill and decided he could not safely continue to fly the 
airplane to the destination airport.  The pilot then initiated a forced landing to a field a few 
miles from the airport.  During the forced landing, the airplane impacted a rising embankment 
and came to rest upright in the field.  Examination of the airplane by the inspector revealed the 
nose gear was separated and the firewall was buckled.
Probable Cause and Findings

the pilot's inability to maintain aircraft control during the forced landing which resulted in a 
collision with terrain.  A contributing factor was the pilot becoming ill during cruise flight.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
