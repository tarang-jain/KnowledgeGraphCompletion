Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
After making contact with the tower, and being cleared for a left base entry, the pilot completed 
his before landing check and lowered the landing gear. He then tried to call the tower to report 
he was entering the base leg, but realized that his radio was not transmitting. The aircraft 
subsequently experienced a complete loss of electrical power, and the pilot was therefore 
unable to confirm the gear was down and locked, as the green Gear Down lights were unable to 
illuminate. The pilot then flew low over the runway until he felt the main wheels touch the 
runway surface, and then he executed a go-around. After completing the go-around, the pilot 
went around the pattern and executed what he thought was going to be a normal full stop 
landing. But just after the aircraft touched down, the landing gear folded back up into the 
wheel wells, and the aircraft skidded down the runway on its belly. The investigation later 
determined that the gear had not fully extended because of the loss of electrical power. It was 
also determined that although the aircraft's battery and alternator were capable of operating 
normally, the voltage regulating system had malfunctioned, thus allowing the battery to 
become almost fully discharged. The pilot did not use the emergency gear extension 
system/sequence to make sure of the position and condition of the landing gear, but instead 
trusted the gear to be fully down and locked just because he felt the tires touch the runway 
surface during the low pass.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The collapse of the landing gear due to the pilot's failure to use the emergency gear extension 
system after his aircraft experienced a complete loss of electrical power. Factors include the 
malfunction of the voltage regulating system, which lead to the almost total discharge of the 
battery.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
