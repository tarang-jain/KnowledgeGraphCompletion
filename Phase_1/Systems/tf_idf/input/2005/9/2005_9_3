Accident Number:
IAD05LA129
Date & Time:
09/01/2005, 1950 EDT 
Registration:
N821AA
Aircraft:
Dassault/Sud Falcon 20D
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Non-scheduled
Analysis 
The small, twin-engine business jet was about 15 feet above the runway on takeoff, when a 
flock of birds from both sides of the runway flew up in front of the airplane.  The number two 
engine "surged," and "loud reports" were heard before the copilot noted a complete loss of 
power on the number two engine instruments.  The airplane climbed for about 10 seconds, 
before the copilot observed the gas producer (N1) gauge on the number one engine decay 
through 50 percent.  The stall warning horn sounded, and the pilot adjusted the flight controls 
for landing.  The airplane contacted the runway with the landing gear retracted, overran the 
runway, struck a fence, crossed a road, and came to rest in a cornfield about 1,000 feet beyond 
the initial point of ground contact.  Post accident examination of both engines revealed 
evidence and damage consistent with multiple bird ingestion.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The ingestion of multiple birds in each engine at takeoff, which resulted in a complete loss of 
engine power.

Factual Information
On September 1, 2005, at 1950 eastern daylight time, a Dassault/Sud Falcon 20D, N821AA, 
operated by USA Jet Airlines, Inc., was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain during 
a forced landing after takeoff from Lorain County Regional Airport (LPR), Lorain, Ohio.  The 
pilot, a certificated airline transport pilot, was not injured, and the copilot, also a certificated 
airline transport pilot, received minor injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for 
the cargo flight, destined for Lambert-St. Louis International Airport (STL), St. Louis, 
Missouri.  An instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight conducted under 14 CFR 
Part 135.
According to statements provided by the pilot, copilot, and the director of safety for USA Jet, 
the flight from Willow Run Airport (YIP), Detroit, Michigan, to Lorain County Regional 
Airport, was described as "uneventful," and no deficiencies with the airplane were reported.  
The airplane was then loaded with 380 pounds of cargo, and departed with a fuel load of 6,700 
pounds.
After engine start, an instrument clearance was received from air traffic control, and the 
airplane was taxied to runway 25.
The pilot was flying the airplane at takeoff, as the copilot monitored the flight instruments, and 
made "V" speed and rotation callouts.  When the airplane was about 15 feet above the runway, 
birds flew up from both sides of the runway, and into both engines.  The number two engine 
"surged," and made several "loud reports" before the copilot noted a complete loss of power on 
the number two engine instruments.  The copilot announced the loss of power, and the pilot 
called for retraction of the landing gear.
The airplane climbed for about 10 seconds, before the copilot observed the gas producer (N1) 
gauge on the number one engine decay through 50 percent.  The stall warning horn sounded, 
and the pilot adjusted the flight controls for landing.
The airplane contacted the runway "straight and level at approximately 130 knots," with the 
landing gear retracted, about 3,000 feet beyond the point of rotation.  The airplane overran the 
runway, struck a fence, crossed a road, and came to rest in a cornfield about 1,000 feet beyond 
the initial point of ground contact.
On September 2, 2005, the airplane was examined at the scene by Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) aviation safety inspectors.  Initial inspection revealed that the left wing, 
and the number one engine inlet displayed several dents and blood smears.  The core and the 
fan sections of the number one engine displayed extensive foreign object damage, and the 
remains of several birds were visible inside the engine and along the runway and wreckage 
path.
The inlet of the number two engine appeared undamaged, and the engine inlet contained a 
significant amount of vegetation.
On September 8, 2005, an FAA inspector and representatives of General Electric Engines and 
Dassault Falcon Jet performed a detailed examination of both engines.  The damage to the 
number one engine "was consistent with multiple bird ingestion.  Due to the severity of the 
blade damage, it is unlikely that this engine could produce useful thrust."
Examination of the number two engine revealed blood smears in the engine inlet, and evidence 
Page 4 of 7IAD05LA129
of ingestion of "at least 4 birds."  Bird remains were evident in the engine core, and soft body 
damage to fan blades was observed– [and] could have caused the engine to stall–"
The pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single engine land 
and multi-engine land.  His most recent first class medical certificate was issued March 23, 
2005.  The pilot reported 4,444 total hours of flight experience, 639 hours of which were in 
make and model.  His most recent flight review was completed April 5, 2005 in a Falcon 20.
The copilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single engine 
land, multi-engine land, and rotorcraft-helicopter.  His most recent first class medical 
certificate was issued May 23, 2005.  The copilot reported 2,172 total hours of flight experience, 
193 hours of which were in make and model.  His most recent flight review was completed 
March 16, 2005 in a Falcon 20.
At 1953, the weather reported at Lorain County Regional Airport included clear skies with 10 
miles visibility.  The winds were from 280 degrees at 4 knots.  The temperature was 72 degrees 
Fahrenheit, and the dew point was 62 degrees Fahrenheit.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
