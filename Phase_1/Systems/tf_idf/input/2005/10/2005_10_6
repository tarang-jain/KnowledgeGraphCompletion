Analysis   
The 261-hour private pilot lost directional control of the tailwheel-equipped single-engine 
airplane while landing on runway 15 (a 7,202-foot long by 100-foot wide paved runway).  The 
pilot reported "the winds at the airport were gusting" and after touchdown the airplane 
departed the right side of the runway traveling 250 feet on unimproved grass.  After departing 
the runway, the right main wheel assembly separated from the landing gear strut.  Shortly 
thereafter, the airplane ground looped, coming to rest in the upright position.  Automated 
weather at the airport reported the winds from 170 degrees at 10 knots.  The pilot reported 
having accumulated a total of 35 hours in the same make and model.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control while landing.  A contributing factor was the 
wind gusts.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
