Analysis   
The private pilot reported he was landing the tailwheel-equipped airplane on runway 36, which 
required a correction for a left crosswind.  During the landing touchdown, the airplane 
bounced slightly and settled onto the right main tire.  He said he attempted to abort the 
landing, but the airplane went off the runway, and ground looped to the right.  The airplane 
sustained structural damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage.  The pilot noted there 
were no preaccident mechanical problems with the airplane. A weather observation taken at 
the time of the accident consisted of:  Sky conditions and ceiling, 1,500 feet scattered; visibility, 
10 statute miles; wind, 320 degrees (magnetic) at 11 knots.
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to compensate for a crosswind during an aborted landing, which resulted in a 
loss of directional control.  A factor associated with the accident was a crosswind.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
