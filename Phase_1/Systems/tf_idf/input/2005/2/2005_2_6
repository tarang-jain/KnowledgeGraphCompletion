Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The airplane encountered soft soil and nosed over during a landing overrun.  The pilot said he 
touched down beyond the threshold and the airplane bounced once.  By the time the pilot had 
recovered from the bounce and the airplane was in the landing rollout, the pilot determined 
that insufficient runway remained to stop the airplane.  He elected not to perform an aborted 
landing due to the short runway and continued braking efforts.  The airplane overran the end 
of the runway and the nose landing gear encountered soft dirt.  The airplane nosed over and 
came to rest inverted.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's inadequate recovery from a bounced landing, and his failure to abort the landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
