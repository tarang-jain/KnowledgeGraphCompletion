Analysis 
FOLLOWING A DURAL ENGINE CHANG, THE PLT TEST FLEW THE ACFT. ON INITIAL 
CLIMB, AT ABOUT 500 FT AGL, BOTH ENGINES BEGAN BACKFIRING VIOLENTLY & 
LOST POWER. ACCORDING TO THE PLT, POWER SUFFICIENT FOR FLT COULD NOT BE 
OBTAINED, & A FORCED LDG WAS MADE ABOUT 0.75 MILES FROM THE ARPT. THE 
LDG OCCURRED IN OPEN DESERT TERRAIN & THE ACFT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY 
DAMAGED. THE PLT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE DID NOT CHECK THE POSITION OF 
THE CONTROL HANDLES FOR THE SUPERCHARGERS DURING EITHER HIS PRE-
FLIGHT OR PRE-TAKEOFF INSPECTIONS. AND THE BLOWERS HAD BEEN 
INADVERTENTLY LEFT SET TO THE HIGH BLOWER POSITION. ACCORDING TO THE 
PLT, THE CHECKLIST WHICH HE WAS USING FOR THE ACFT DID NOT ADDRESS THE 
POSITION OF THE BLOWERS BECAUSE FOR THE PAST 15 YRS IT HAD BEEN COMPANY 
POLICY TO 'WIRE THE BLOWERS TO THE LOW BLOWER POSITION.'

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
