Analysis 
WHILE HOVERING AND SLINGING AN EXTERNAL LOAD OVER ROUGH TERRAIN THE 
ENG CHIP LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE PLT IMMEDIATELY POSITIONED THE ACFT TO 
RELEASE THE LOAD AND THE ENG BEGAN MAKING A 'WHINING' NOISE. SEVERAL 
SECONDS LATER ALL ENG POWER WAS LOST. THE PLT AUTOROTATED TO A FIRM 
LANDING AND UPON TOUCHDOWN THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES FLEXED DOWNWARD 
AND SEVERED THE TAIL BOOM. EXAM OF THE ENG'S TURBINE COMPONENTS 
REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF A 'SLUDGE' MATERIAL IN THE SCAVENGE OIL LINE 
FROM THE NO. 8 BEARING AND ALSO THE PRESENCE OF A HEAVY BUILD UP OF 
CARBON ON THE ENGINE ROTOR 'PEASHOOTER' DRIVE SHAFT. THE ACCUMULATED 
MATERIAL CAUSED SHAFT RUB AND FAILURE OF THE POWER TURBINE'S INNER 
SHAFT. THE OPERATOR REPORTED THAT AN EARLY INSPECTION OF THE N1/N2 
DRIVE SHAFT AREA COULD HAVE DETECTED THE PROBLEM AND PREVENTED THE 
ACCIDENT.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
