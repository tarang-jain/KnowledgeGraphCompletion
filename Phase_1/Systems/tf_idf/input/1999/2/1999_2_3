Analysis 
According to the statements of the three cabin attendants and the flight crew, the aircraft had 
been in light to moderate turbulence for most of the flight.  The seat belt sign was illuminated 
and several public address system announcements had been made for the passengers to remain 
seated with their seat belts fastened.  The flight and cabin crewmembers reported that at the 
time of the incident the turbulence had abated and the ride was smooth; however, the seat belt 
sign remained illuminated.  A 70-year-old male passenger in seat 23C got up and began 
walking toward the aft lavatory.  One cabin attendant told the passenger to return to his seat 
unless it was an absolute necessity to visit the lavatory.  The passenger, who has two artificial 
legs, declined to follow the cabin attendant's instruction and continued to the aft galley area 
where he fell, fracturing his hip.  The crew obtained medical advice by radio from Med Link, 
and, after consultation with a physician, the aircraft continued to its destination.

fractured hip on America West Airlines Flight 5 while en route between Tampa, Florida, and 
Las Vegas, Nevada.  The accident occurred while the aircraft was in cruise flight at flight level 
310, approximately 1.5 hours after departure from Tampa.  The aircraft, an Airbus A320-232, 
N640AW, was not damaged.  The captain, first officer, 3 cabin attendants and the remaining

Tampa at 0640 eastern standard time as a non-stop flight to Las Vegas.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
