Analysis 
A Federal Express DC-10-10F sustained no damage during a near mid-air collision with an 
American International Airways Lockheed L-1011-385-1-15, 30 miles west of Salina, Kansas. 
The aircraft came within an estimated 1/2 mile horizontal and 0 feet vertical separation of each 
other. The FAA issued a Final Operational Error/Deviation Report.  The report indicated that 
an ATC controller '...dropped the data block on FDX3207 [DC-10] without transferring 
communications...' to another controller.  The report also indicated that another ATC 
controller, '...issued CKS303 [L-1011] a frequency change to 125.67 instead of the correct 
frequency of 127.65.  CKS303 acknowledged the wrong frequency correctly by reading back 
125.67.'  ATC recognized that both airplanes were NORDO but were unable to reestablish radio 
communications, although several means were tried.  The CKS303 First Officer reported he 
saw the DC-10 at their 8 o'clock position at 1/2 mile and same altitude.  He reported he turned 
to the right 30 degrees.  The FDX3207 pilots reported they did not see the L-1011 but felt its 
wake turbulence.  Current FAA regulations do not require any aircraft used exclusively for 
cargo operations to be equipped with any version of TCAS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
The ARTCC personnel failed to maintain radio communications with both airplanes and failed 
to maintain IFR separation standards. Factors relating to the incident were the FAA does not 
require cargo airplanes to be equipped with TCAS and neither airplane was equipped with 
TCAS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
