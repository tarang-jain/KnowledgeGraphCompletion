Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
GALLUP, NM
Accident Number:
DEN00LA001
Date & Time:
10/01/1999, 0645 MDT 
Registration:
N716JB
Aircraft:
GRAY ROTORWAY EXEC
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The pilot remained in the traffic pattern to practice touch and go landings.  At approximately 
the point where the helicopter would turn onto the base leg, rotor rpm began to decay (95%).  
The pilot turned towards the runway and began autorotation.  During the descent, the pilot 
managed to avoid houses and powerlines.  The helicopter struck the ground tail first, then 
rolled over on its left side.  The engine was later functionally tested and, despite impact damage 
to the crankshaft, operated normally. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot inadvertently allowing main rotor rpm to decay while avoiding obstacles during an 
emergency autorotation following a loss of power for reasons undetermined.  Factors were 
houses and powerlines.

Factual Information
 On October 1, 1999, approximately 0645 mountain daylight time, a Gray Rotorway Executive 
homebuilt helicopter, N716JB, registered to and operated by the pilot, was destroyed when it 
collided with terrain during descent at Gallup, New Mexico.  The solo student pilot was 
seriously injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed 
for the instructional flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  The flight originated at 
Gallup, New Mexico, approximately 0630.
In his accident report, the pilot said he intended on remaining in the traffic pattern to practice 
touch and go landings.  He had purposely planned the early morning flight because the "wind 
is usually calm and density altitude is lowest, giving the helicopter best performance 
capabilities."  The flight was uneventful until the helicopter reached the point where the pilot 
would turn from downwind to base leg, and he noticed the "rotor rpm was low (95%)."  He 
turned the helicopter towards the runway and "lowered collective [to] stabilize rotor rpm."  At 
this point, "the engine failed."  He "lowered collective [control] all the way down, [pushed] the 
cyclic [control] forward, and began autorotation."  The helicopter descended toward houses, so 
he "extended [the descent path] by pulling collective."  Rotor rpm fell to 80%.  The pilot headed 
towards a small open field but as he descended to 100 feet agl (above ground level), he noticed 
powerlines ahead.  He did a "second extension," and power dropped to 60%.  Approximately 
30 feet agl, he pulled the nose up and added full up collective to arrest the descent.  The 
helicopter struck the ground tail first, then rolled over on its left side.
In December 1999, the engine was functionally tested at the facilities of Rotorway in Chandler, 
Arizona.  Despite impact damage to the crankshaft, the engine operated normally.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
