Location:
Toccoa, GA
Accident Number:
ERA15CA002
Date & Time:
10/02/2014, 1800 EDT 
Registration:
N6044W
Aircraft:
PIPER PA-28-140
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Controlled flight into terr/obj 
(CFIT)
Injuries:
1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The flight instructor was conducting a biennial flight review for the private pilot\owner of the 
airplane. The private pilot departed from the 5,008-foot-long runway, performed a touch-and-
go landing without incident, and entered the traffic pattern for a simulated short-field landing. 
While on short final, the airplane struck a berm that was located just prior to runway and 
sustained substantial damage to the landing gear and right wing. The flight instructor stated 
that he realized that the airplane was low and expected the private pilot to add engine power; 
however, he did not attempt to manipulate the flight controls or provide any verbal 
instructions. The private pilot stated that he also realized that the airplane was low, but did not 
react prior to contact with the ground. Both pilots indicated that they did not experience any 
preaccident malfunctions or failures of the airplane that would have precluded normal 
operation. The private pilot reported about 600 hours of total flight experience, which included 
about 475 hours in the same make and model as the accident airplane. The flight instructor 
reported about 3,430 hours of total flight experience, which included about 200 hours in the 
same make and model as the accident airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The private pilot's failure to maintain proper altitude and the flight instructor's failure to 
provide correction action, which resulted in a collision with terrain during landing.
Findings
Aircraft
Altitude - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=90200
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
