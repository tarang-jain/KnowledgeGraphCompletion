Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Nome, AK
Accident Number:
ANC14CA014
Date & Time:
01/04/2014, 1445 AST 
Registration:
N8177A
Aircraft:
CESSNA 170 - B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel contamination
Injuries:
1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Flight Test
Analysis   
According to the pilot, the airplane was pulled out of the hangar and preflighted for a 
maintenance test flight, following an extensive annual inspection. Approximately 10 minutes 
after departure the airplane lost all engine power, and made an emergency landing on the sea 
ice. During the emergency landing the airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. 
While inspecting the airplane after the accident, the pilot said he found water in the airplane's 
gascolator. A postaccident examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration 
aviation safety inspector revealed water in the fuel system, including the carburetor bowl. The 
pilot indicated that other than the water in the fuel, there were no preaccident mechanical 
malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. 
In the pilot's written statement to the National Transportation Safety Board he noted that the 
accident might have been avoided if the airplane had been placed on level ground after it was 
pulled from the hangar, thereby allowing the water to be drained from the fuel system. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to adequately remove water-contaminated fuel during the preflight 
inspection, which resulted in a total loss of engine power.
Findings

Fuel - Inadequate inspection (Cause)
Fuel - Fluid condition (Cause)

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=88642
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
