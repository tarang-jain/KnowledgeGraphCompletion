Factual Information
On January 1, 2014, about 1045 eastern standard time, a Beechcraft A36, N1803X, operated by 
a private individual, came to rest off of a taxiway after the private pilot became incapacitated at 
Eastern Slopes Regional Airport (IZG), Fryeburg, Maine. The private pilot was fatally injured. 
The personal flight was conducted under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the planned cross-country 
flight destined for Linden Airport (LDJ), Linden, New Jersey. 
According to the pilot's son, his father, age 75, intended to fly the airplane home to New Jersey. 
After speaking to his father through a cockpit window, the son walked to his car and the pilot 
began a slow taxi to the runway. The airplane drifted to the right and came to rest next to a 
snow bank. The son ran to the airplane and found his father slumped over the control yoke. 
Emergency medical services transported the pilot to a hospital, where he was pronounced 
deceased. No damage was observed on the airplane.
The son reported nothing abnormal about the pilot's behavior on the day of the accident. He 
also stated the pilot had no prior medical problems, and that his death was a surprise to their 
family.
The pilot held a private pilot certificate, with ratings for airplane single-engine land, airplane 
single-engine sea, and instrument airplane. The pilot's most recent Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) third-class medical certificate was issued on January 6, 2012. At that 
time, the pilot reported 3,940 hours of total flight experience. 
According to the pilot's FAA medical record, the pilot first received a third class medical 
certificate in 1964, with a restriction for corrective lenses. On January 2, 1980 the pilot was 
issued a second class medical certificate and a statement of demonstrated ability for defective 
distant vision of the left eye. The pilot's most recent physical examination was dated January 6, 
2012 and with the exception of daily prophylactic Aspirin, the pilot did not report use of any 
additional medications or any medical problems or procedures. 
An autopsy was performed on January 3, 2014, by the New Hampshire Medical Examiner's 
Office, Concord, New Hampshire. According to the autopsy report, the pilot's cause of death 
was "severe coronary artery atherosclerosis" and the manner of death was "natural." 
Significant disease was identified in the heart, which was markedly enlarged at a weight of 608 
grams (normal for a man of his weight is 345 +/- 40) and had evidence of hypertensive heart 
disease with the left ventricular wall measured at 2.0 cm (normal is up to 1.3 cm). In addition, 
the pilot had severe three-vessel coronary artery atherosclerosis (up to 90% stenosis), scarring 
from a remote myocardial infarct of the posterior left ventricle and a calcific aortic stenosis. 
The wife reported to the medical examiner that the pilot had a history of heart disease. 
Toxicological testing was performed on the pilot by the FAA Bioaeronautical Science Research 
Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The testing revealed Rosuvastatin in the heart and 
urine, and 39 (ug/ml, ug/g) of Salicylate in the urine. Rosuvastatin, marketed under the trade 
name Crestor, is a prescription lipid-lowering agent used to treat elevated blood lipids and 
elevated cholesterol. Salicylate is a metabolite of Aspirin, an over-the-counter anti-
inflammatory medication to treat aches and pains and reduce fever. Aspirin also has an anti-
platelet effect, used to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
