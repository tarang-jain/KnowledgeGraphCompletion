Analysis   
The pilot returned to the airfield after a short cross-country flight. According to the pilot, he 
chose runway 36, and observed a slight crosswind off to the right. The pilot added that the 
tailwheel equipped airplane swerved left after touchdown, so he attempted a go-around 
maneuver; he closed the carburetor heat control and added full throttle. During the attempted 
go-around, the airplane's main landing gear remained in contact with the ground and the 
airplane exited the runway. The airplane then crossed between the runway and taxiway, 
impacted a snow berm, and came to rest inverted. Examination of the airplane revealed 
substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings. The pilot reported no mechanical 
anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of control during a crosswind landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
