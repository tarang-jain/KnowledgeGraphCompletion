Part 91: General Aviation - Business
Analysis   
According to the pilot, he flew the traffic pattern to a touchdown zone landing on runway 
centerline. However, after touching down, the airplane "floated back up," then touched down 
again "with authority." It bounced again, then "weather vaned some," and the pilot became 
concerned that the airplane was "chewing up runway." The airplane then touched down a third 
time, but the pilot did not pull back on the yoke. He subsequently heard the propeller strike the 
runway, the airplane then veered off the right side of the runway, the nose landing gear 
collapsed, and the engine mounts broke. The pilot indicated that there were no preexisting 
mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Nearest recorded weather 
included winds that were about 90 degrees from the right of the runway, at 10, gusting to 15 
knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper recovery from a bounced landing during gusty crosswind conditions.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
