PIPER PA 22-150
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
According to the pilot, while in the landing flare, the tailwheel-equipped airplane began to roll 
to the left. He applied right aileron to counteract the roll and provide wind correction; 
however, as the airplane decelerated during the landing roll, it lacked rudder authority to 
counteract a gust of wind from the right. The airplane ground looped 180 degrees to the right, 
and the left main landing gear collapsed, resulting in substantial damage to the outboard 
portion of the left wing and left horizontal stabilizer. The pilot reported no preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal 
operation. Recorded wind velocity at a nearby airport about the time of the accident was 15 
knots, with gusts to 25 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of control while landing the tailwheel-equipped airplane in gusting wind 
conditions, which resulted in a ground loop.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Gusts - Effect on operation

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
