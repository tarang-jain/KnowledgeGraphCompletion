Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Longmont, CO
Accident Number:
CEN14LA267
Date & Time:
06/01/2014, 0915 MDT 
Registration:
N206ND
Aircraft:
DIAMOND AIRCRAFT IND INC DA20-
C1
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that the engine lost all power after the airplane took off and climbed to 
about 400 feet. He then made a forced landing to a field adjacent to the airport. The airplane 
struck the ground nose first and skidded about 150 feet before coming to a stop; the nose gear 
was sheared off. During a postaccident examination of the airplane, only a few drops of fuel 
were recovered from the wing and gascolator fuel drains; no fuel could be seen in either tank. 
The pilot noted that fuel had been leaking from the tanks for three days before the 
examination. However, even if minimal fuel had been present during the accident flight, more 
than a few drops should have drained out of the gascolator drain. Had the pilot done a 
thorough preflight inspection, he should have noted the lack of fuel in the tanks.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion. Contributing to the accident was the pilot™s 
inadequate preflight inspection.

Factual Information
On June 1, 2014, about 0915 mountain daylight time, a Diamond DA 20-C1, N206ND, collided 
with terrain after the engine lost power near Longmont, Colorado. The commercial pilot, the 
sole occupant on board, was not injured. The airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane 
was registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time 
of the accident, and no flight plan had been filed. The local flight was originating when the 
accident occurred.
In a telephone interview, the pilot said the airplane had just come out of an annual inspection 
and his mechanic had performed a post-maintenance engine functional test up to full power. 
All systems operated normally and the engine performed well. The accident flight was a test 
flight after the annual inspection. The pilot said prior to takeoff, he also ran the engine up to 
full power. No anomalies were noted. The pilot took off and after climbing to about 400 feet, 
the engine lost power. The pilot made a forced landing in a field adjacent to the airport. The 
airplane struck the ground nose first, shearing off the nose gear, and skidded about 150 feet 
before coming to a stop. The empennage was separated from the fuselage.
On June 4, three Federal Aviation Administration inspectors examined the airplane in the 
presence of the pilot. According to the lead inspector, the airplane was equipped with two fuel 
drains --- one for the fuel tank and one for the gascolator. Only a few drops of fuel were 
recovered from each drain. No fuel could be seen in the fuel tank. The pilot said fuel had been 
leaking from the fuel tank for three days before the FAA inspectors arrived. According to the 
FAA inspector's report, if there had been minimal fuel aboard the airplane, fuel greater than a 
few drops would have drained out of the gascolator drain during the examination.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
