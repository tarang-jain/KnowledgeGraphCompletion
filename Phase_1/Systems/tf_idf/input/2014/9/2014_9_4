Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Marshalltown, IA
Accident Number:
CEN14LA472
Date & Time:
09/01/2014, 1740 CST 
Registration:
N419B
Aircraft:
OHLGREN BRENT E RV-6A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot said he visually checked and verified that the right wing fuel tank was just under half 
full and that the left wing fuel tank was just over half full prior to takeoff. As the airplane 
approached the destination, about 190 nm from the departure airport, the pilot decided to 
conduct a practice visual approach. Shortly after turning onto final approach, the engine lost 
power. After employing emergency procedures, the pilot was able to restore power and climbed 
the airplane to 3,100 feet. He then checked the fuel gauges, which both indicated one-eighth 
full. The engine then lost power a second time. The pilot made a forced landing in a bean field, 
and the airplane nosed over. During postaccident examination, no fuel sloshing could be heard 
when the wings were rocked; both wing fuel caps were then removed from the inverted 
airplane and no fuel leaked out. The airplane was righted, and when the master switch was 
turned on, the left fuel gauge was one needle-width above empty and the right fuel gauge 
indicated empty. The integrity of the fuel tanks appeared to be intact, and no fuel leaked from 
the tanks. No fuel was visible in either fuel tank. No fuel was recovered when the left and right 
wing fuel sump drains were removed. After adding fuel, the engine was started and ran at idle 
power until it was shut down.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion as a result of the pilot's misjudgment of the 
amount of fuel onboard prior to flight.
Findings

Fuel - Not serviced/maintained (Cause)

Factual Information
On September 1, 2014, about 1740 central standard time, the pilot of an Ohlgren Vans RV-6A, 
N419B, made a forced landing in a bean field after the engine lost power 5 miles south of the 
Marshalltown Municipal Airport (MIW), Marshalltown, Iowa,. The pilot, the sole occupant on 
board, was not injured. The airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane was registered to 
and operated by the pilot as a personal flight under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and 
no flight plan had been filed. The local flight originated from Marv Skie-Lincoln County Airport 
(Y14), Tea, South Dakota, about 1615.
The pilot said that prior to departing Y14, he visually checked and verified that the right wing 
fuel tank was "just under" half full and the left wing fuel tank was "just over" half full (a half-
full tank contains 19 useable gallons). En route, the pilot switched tanks "multiple times." 
Approaching KMIW, the pilot decided he would practice a visual approach using the RNAV 
(GPS) RWY 31 instrument approach procedure. Shortly after turning onto final approach at 
VUNDY IAF (initial approach fix), the engine lost power. After employing emergency 
procedures, the pilot was able to restore power and climbed to 3,100 feet. He said he checked 
the fuel gauges and they both indicated 1/8-full. The engine lost power a second time. The pilot 
made a forced landing in a bean field and the airplane nose over.
On September 2, two airworthiness inspectors and an operations inspector from the Des 
Moines Flight Standards District Office went to the accident site. They reported the airplane 
was inverted and the vertical stabilizer and rudder were crushed. The right wing outboard 
leading edge and tip were crushed. The nose gear was bent. The inspectors rocked the wings 
rocked back and forth and could not hear any fuel sloshing. Both wing fuel caps were removed 
and no fuel leaked out.
On September 18, 2014, FAA inspectors returned to the accident site. A recovery crew was at 
the site and turned the aircraft over so that it was resting on its landing gear. With the master 
switch on, the left fuel gage was one needle-width above empty and the right fuel gage 
indicated empty. There was no dead or discolored vegetation around the airplane, and the 
integrity of the fuel tanks appeared intact. No fuel leaked from the tanks. No fuel was visible in 
either fuel tank. No fuel was recovered when the left and right wing fuel sump drains were 
removed.
Fuel was added to the right tank and the engine was started. It ran at an idle power for about 
30 seconds before being shut down.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
