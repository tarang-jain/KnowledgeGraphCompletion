Substantial
Defining Event:

Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Business
Analysis   
While in cruise flight an unsecured jacket departed the helicopter through an open window. 
The tail rotor drive shaft sheared as a result of the jacket's contact with the tail rotors. The pilot 
subsequently initiated a forced landing to an orchard where during landing, the main rotors 
struck and separated the tailboom. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions 
or failures with the helicopter that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to adequately secure cargo (a jacket), which resulted in the jacket exiting the 
cabin compartment and colliding with the tail rotor during cruise flight.

Aircraft
Personnel issues
Incomplete action - Pilot (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
