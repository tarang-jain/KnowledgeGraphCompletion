ERA14LA418
Date & Time:
09/01/2014, 1200 EDT 
Registration:
N94SL
Aircraft:
LORENZ STEPHEN KITFOX   SERIES 5
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot, who had no previous experience in the airplane make and model, had 
purchased it about 1 year earlier and then stored it in his garage until the day of the accident. 
On the day of the accident, the pilot added 4 gallons of gas; he subsequently started the engine, 
taxied the airplane, and conducted engine run-ups for about 30 minutes to familiarize himself 
with the airplane. He powered up the engine three or four times, and during the last power up, 
the airplane lifted off. The pilot reported that he then attempted a three-point landing; this is 
all that he remembered about the accident sequence. 
A witness reported that, after takeoff, the airplane ﬁjerkedﬂ right and that the power settings 
changed. The airplane then ﬁstraightened out and smoothed outﬂ and then continued to climb 
slowly to about 200 ft above the ground, at which point it banked ﬁhardﬂ left and then 
descended to impact. Another witness reported that the airplane ﬁtippedﬂ and ﬁstalledﬂ before 
its descent. A postcrash fire ensued, which consumed most of the airplane. 
No preexisting mechanical anomalies were found that would have precluded normal operation, 
and the pilot reported no preexisting mechanical malfunctions or failures. Wind recorded at an 
airport about 10 miles from the departure airport about the time of the accident was from the 
direction of takeoff at 4 knots, and a witness noted that both windsocks were ﬁdeadﬂ at the 
accident airport. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s failure to attain adequate airspeed during the initial climb, which resulted in an 
exceedance of the wing™s critical angle-of-attack and a subsequent aerodynamic stall. 
Contributing to the accident was the pilot™s lack of experience in the airplane make and model.

Factual Information
On September 1, 2014, about 1200 eastern daylight time, an experimental amateur-built 
Lorenze Kitfox Series 5, N94SL, was destroyed when it impacted terrain in Greene, New York. 
The private pilot was seriously injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no 
flight plan had been filed for the local flight from Greene Airport (4N7), Greene, New York. The 
personal flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.
According to the pilot, he and his wife purchased the airplane in October 2013, and it was 
stored in their garage until the day before the accident. On the day of the accident, the pilot 
added 4 gallons of gas before starting the engine, taxiing and performing engine run ups to 
familiarize himself with the airplane. He powered up the engine three or four times, and during 
the last time, "wind lifted the aircraft." The pilot then "tried to make 3 point ground contact 
and that is the last [he] remembered."    
According to several witnesses, the pilot initially taxied and did control checks for about 30 
minutes before taking off [from runway 25]. One witness noted that upon takeoff, the airplane 
"jerked" to the right, and the witness could hear changes in power settings. The airplane then 
"straightened out and smoothed out." About 200 feet above the ground, and while "slow, 
climbing, banked hard left, up on wingtip," then "continued to impact." Other witnesses stated 
that the airplane "tipped" and "stalled" prior to its descent.
A witness who responded to the accident stated that upon reaching the airplane, it was on fire 
and he pulled the pilot away from it. He asked the pilot what happened, and the pilot stated 
that, "wind was an issue." However, the witness further noted that at the time of the accident, 
"both windsocks at 4N7 were dead." 
The airplane was mostly consumed in a postcrash fire.
Neither the pilot nor any witness, nor the responding Federal Aviation Administration 
inspector reported any preexisting mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation. The pilot also checked "No" to the question "Was there mechanical 
malfunction/failure?" on his submitted NTSB Pilot/Operator Report. The pilot further 
reported no previous experience in airplane make and model.
Weather was not recorded at the airport. The nearest recorded weather, at  an airport 10 nm to 
the southwest, at 1153, included wind from 250 degrees true at 4 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
