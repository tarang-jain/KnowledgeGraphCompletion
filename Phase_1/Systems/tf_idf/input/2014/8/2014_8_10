Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Fort Bridger, WY
Accident Number:
WPR14LA323
Date & Time:
08/01/2014, 1028 MDT 
Registration:
N116GS
Aircraft:
RANS S-16
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
Shortly after takeoff, experimental amateur-built airplane™s engine lost all power. The 
pilot/owner performed a forced landing onto a road, and, during the landing flare, the main 
landing gear caught the edge of the road and collapsed. The airplane struck a pit and sustained 
substantial damage. The pilot had recently reinstalled the engine™s fuel servo following the 
servo™s overhaul, and this was the first flight since the installation. Postaccident examination 
revealed that the fuel line™s B-nut fitting connecting the fuel servo to the fuel flow divider was 
about 1 1/3 turns loose. It is likely that the pilot had either forgotten to tighten the fitting or 
had not applied sufficient torque during reinstallation of the servo.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The fuel flow divider inlet line™s B-nut coming loose during takeoff, resulting in a total loss of 
engine power. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to adequately tighten the B-
nut during recent maintenance.
Findings
Aircraft
Fuel divider - Incorrect service/maintenance (Cause)
Personnel issues
Repair - Pilot (Factor)

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On August 1, 2014, at 1028 mountain daylight time, an experimental amateur-built Gerald 
Spittler (Rans Inc.) S-16 Shekari, N116GS, lost engine power following takeoff from Fort 
Bridger Airport, Fort Bridger, Wyoming. The airplane was registered to, and operated by, the 
pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a local flight. The 
private pilot and passenger were not injured, and the airplane sustained substantial damage 
during the forced landing. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had 
been filed.
The pilot reported performing an uneventful preflight check and engine run-up. He taxied onto 
the runway and applied full engine throttle control, and the airplane accelerated appropriately. 
Having reached a speed of 65 mph about 1,500 feet down the runway, he initiated a climb to 30 
feet above ground level (agl), remaining over the runway as the airplane accelerated. Having 
attained a speed of 100 mph, he applied aft elevator control and the airplane climbed to about 
200 feet agl as he approached the end of the runway. Shortly thereafter, the engine began to 
hesitate, and then lose all power. With minimal altitude, the pilot elected to maintain the 
airplane's heading and land on a dirt road ahead. He confirmed the fuel boost pump was on, 
and applied full rich fuel mixture control with no change in power. Just prior to landing he 
changed course for a larger road, and during the landing flare the right main landing gear 
caught the edge of the road and collapsed. The airplane struck a pit and spun around, 
sustaining substantial damage to the left wing and aft fuselage.
The pilot stated that the fuel servo had recently been overhauled due to a low fuel pressure 
problem. He reinstalled the unit himself following overhaul, and this was the first flight since.
An airframe and powerplant mechanic examined the engine following the accident under the 
direction of the NTSB investigator-in-charge. Examination of the fuel inlet line, which 
connected the fuel servo to the fuel flow divider, revealed that it was approximately 1 1/3 turns 
loose at the 'B' nut fitting at the fuel flow divider. The mechanic did not observe any other 
anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
