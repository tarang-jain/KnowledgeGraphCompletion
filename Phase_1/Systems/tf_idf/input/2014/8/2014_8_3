Analysis   
According to the FAA Certificated flight instructor, he was instructing the student rated pilot 
on a mountain flying technique known as "popping the flaps" in order to aid in gaining altitude 
during short field takeoffs. He stated that shortly after rotation, the student reached down to 
pop the flaps and inadvertently leaned on the yoke, causing the airplane to descend, strike the 
ground and loop to the right. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing spar.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical failures or anomalies with the airplane prior 
to or during the flight that would have prevented normal flight operation.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=89963
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
