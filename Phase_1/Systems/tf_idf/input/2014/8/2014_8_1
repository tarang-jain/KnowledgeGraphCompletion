Analysis   
The pilot was landing a float-equipped airplane at a remote lake, during glassy water 
conditions. Glassy water landings usually consume a considerable landing area. The pilot 
stated that during the landing, the airplane touched down in the typical area as in previous 
landings; however, the airplane remained on the step (the float/hull is supported on top of the 
water surface as opposed to plowing through it) longer than usual and the floats subsequently 
impacted the shoreline. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. The pilot 
stated that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have 
precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate landing technique that resulted in a landing area overrun. Contributing 
was the glassy water conditions.

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=89791
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
