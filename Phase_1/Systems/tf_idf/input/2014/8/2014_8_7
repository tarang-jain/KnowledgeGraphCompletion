Location:
Honolulu, HI
Accident Number:
WPR14CA325
Date & Time:
08/01/2014, 1500 HST 
Registration:
N110JC
Aircraft:
ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY 
R44 II
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of tail rotor effectiveness
Injuries:
3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that while air-taxiing east about 15 feet above ground level (agl) to parking 
with adjoining buildings on both sides, which were known for buffeting winds that made it 
difficult to control the helicopter's yaw, he encountered a strong gust of wind. The helicopter 
abruptly yawed to the right and he input left pedal control which did not correct the right yaw. 
The helicopter continued rotating to the right at an increasing speed; full left pedal had no 
effect. The pilot stated that the helicopter subsequently completed several 360-degree turns to 
the right, which rendered it completely uncontrollable; he abruptly lowered the collective from 
about 8 to 10 feet agl to get the helicopter on the ground. During the descent the helicopter's 
left skid impacted the center of the taxiway, slid toward a fuel truck, and came to rest on its 
right side. The main rotor blade impacted a fuel truck's windshield. The helicopter sustained 
substantial damage to the tail boom and the upper and lower cabin/cockpit structure. The pilot 
reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter that would have 
precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the wind conditions and failure to maintain aircraft 
control during taxi, which resulted in a loss of tail rotor effectiveness and subsequent impact 
with the taxiway and a parked fuel truck.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
