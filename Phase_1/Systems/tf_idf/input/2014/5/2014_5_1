2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
According to the flight instructor, he gave the pilot under instruction (PUI) a simulated engine 
failure after takeoff when the helicopter reached approximately 50 knots. The PUI pulled the 
cyclic aft and increased collective. The flight instructor joined the PUI on the controls to 
prevent him from pulling too much collective and to lower the helicopter's nose to a level 
attitude. Both pilots were on the controls as the collective was increased to cushion the landing. 
The helicopter landed on the paved runway's centerline, and as it slid across what the pilots 
described as an uneven surface, it began to porpoise. The flight instructor lowered the 
collective to slow the slide and heard a noise, then the helicopter began vibrate and turned 220 
degrees to the right before coming to a stop. During the slide, a main rotor blade cut off the tail 
boom. Neither pilot reported any preexisting mechanical anomalies that would have precluded 
normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flightcrew's improper recovery from a simulated engine failure after takeoff. Contributing 
to the accident was the flight instructor's failure to clarify who had control of the helicopter.
Findings

Performance/control parameters - Not attained/maintained (Cause)

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=89150
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
