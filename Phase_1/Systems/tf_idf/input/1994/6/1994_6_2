Substantial

1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE GLIDER SUDDENLY PITCHED UP AS HE DESCENDED 
THROUGH THE 'START GATE' AT A GLIDER COMPETITION.  HE ADMITTED THAT THE 
PITCH-UP WAS 'PROBABLY PILOT INDUCED.'  HE STATED THAT HE THEN HEARD A 
LOUD CRACKING NOISE AND HIS HAND-HELD RADIO FELL LOOSE IN THE COCKPIT.  
HE ATTEMPTED TO RETRIEVE THE RADIO, BUT IT BROKE THROUGH THE CANOPY.  
THE PILOT DECIDED TO EXIT THE AIRPLANE AFTER FAILED ATTEMPTS TO REGAIN 
CONTROL.  HE RELEASED HIMSELF FROM THE SEAT RESTRAINTS AND FELL 
THROUGH THE PLEXIGLASS CANOPY.  HE DEPLOYED HIS PARACHUTE AND LANDED 
IN A TREE, AND THEN FELL FROM THE TREE ONTO THE GROUND, CAUSING SERIOUS 
INJURIES.  THE UNMANNED GLIDER IMPACTED TERRAIN INVERTED AND WAS 
SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED.  NO MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS WITH THE FLIGHT 
CONTROLS, CANOPY, OR SEAT RESTRAINT SYSTEMS WERE FOUND. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE 
DURING THE MANEUVER.

Factual Information
 On June 1, 1994, about 1420 eastern daylight time, N166W, a Shemp Hirth Ventus-C glider, 
operated by the owner/pilot, impacted terrain in Fairfield, Pennsylvania, during an 
uncontrolled descent.  The airplane was substantially damaged.  The pilot, the sole occupant, 
received serious injuries after falling out of the airplane while performing a maneuver.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed.  The personal flight was 
initiated via aero tow from the Mid Atlantic Soaring Center in Fairfield, and was conducted 
under 14 CFR 91.      The pilot reported that he was participating in a soaring competition at the 
time of the accident.  He descended through the "start gate" to achieve an airspeed of 110 
knots.  He reported that he then "... encountered [a] sudden pitch up, probably induced by the 
pilot and turbulence."  He subsequently "experienced heavy positive G-load and heard loud 
cracking sound."  His hand-held radio fell loose and he tried to retrieve it.  He stated that he 
then experienced negative Gs and an abrupt pull-up.  The radio broke through the canopy.  The 
pilot stated that he could not regain control of the glider, so he released his restraint system 
and fell free of the airplane through the canopy Plexiglas.  He deployed his parachute and 
landed in a tree.  He then fell about 30 feet from the tree and onto the ground, causing serious 
injuries.       According to an FAA aviation safety inspector from New Cumberland, 
Pennsylvania, the glider continued to descend out of control without the pilot.  It impacted 
terrain inverted about 3/4 miles from the pilot's landing area.  An inspection of the glider 
revealed that both wings were buckled.  The canopy frame and supporting structure remained 
intact, and the Plexiglas in the center of the canopy was broken.  The flight controls, canopy 
and restraint systems were functionally tested with no mechanical deficiencies noted.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
