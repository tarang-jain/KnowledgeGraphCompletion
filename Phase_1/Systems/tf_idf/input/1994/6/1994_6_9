Analysis 
     THE PILOT HAD RETURNED AFTER AN UNEVENTFUL 40-MINUTE FLIGHT WITH A 
PASSENGER.  ABOUT 15 MINUTES LATER, AFTER THE PASSENGER HAD 
DISEMBARKED, THE PILOT TOOK OFF AGAIN.  WITNESSES OBSERVED THE 
AIRPLANE'S TAKEOFF ROLL AND REPORTED NOTHING UNUSUAL.  DURING THE 
INITIAL CLIMB, THE AIRPLANE WAS OBSERVED TO DRIFT TO THE LEFT AND 
SUDDENLY PITCH DOWN AS ITS WINGS ROCKED BACK AND FORTH.  THE AIRPLANE 
STALLED AND DESCENDED INTO TERRAIN IN A NOSE-DOWN ATTITUDE.  AN 
EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE DID NOT REVEAL ANY EVIDENCE OF PRE-IMPACT 
MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS OR FAILURES.  AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, THE 
SUN WAS POSITIONED NEAR THE DIRECTION OF THE TAKEOFF. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE FAILURE OF THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE AIRSPEED.  
THIS LED TO A STALL DURING THE INITIAL TAKEOFF AND CLIMB AT AN ALTITUDE 
THAT DID NOT PERMIT A RECOVERY.  A FACTOR RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WAS 
THE PRESENCE OF SUNGLARE DURING THE TAKEOFF, WHICH RESTRICTED VISUAL 
CUES.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
     On June 2, 1994, about 1945 hours eastern daylight time, N7972F, a Cessna 150F, operated 
by the owner/pilot, impacted terrain in Bloomingburg, Ohio, during an uncontrolled descent 
following takeoff from a private grass airstrip.  The airplane was destroyed.  The certificated 
private pilot, the sole occupant, was fatally injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed 
and a flight plan was not filed.  The local flight departed from the pilot's private grass strip in 
Bloomingburg and was conducted under 14 CFR 91.
     According to witnesses, the pilot had just given a 40-minute airplane ride to a friend and 
landed the airplane after an uneventful flight.  The friend stated that the pilot "... seemed 
satisfied everything was fine during the entire flight" and that "... the weather conditions were 
perfect."  About 15 minutes later, after the friend had disembarked, the pilot was observed 
taking off again.  The friend was standing outside next to the pilot's wife at the time of the 
takeoff.  According to the pilot's wife,
     Everything seemed fine with the takeoff.  I saw [the      airplane] become airborne and start 
to climb.  [There      was] nothing unusual about anything that would have got      my attention.  
I looked away and then about 20 seconds      later I heard [my son] yell about the crash.  
Nothing      unusual about engine sounds got my attention.
     Both witnesses reported that they could not discern what the engine sounded like during the 
climbout, because a motorized bicycle was operating near them.
     The son of the pilot is the only known person to observe the entire accident sequence.  He 
was riding the motorized bicycle when he saw the airplane lift off from the grass strip.  He 
stated that the airplane climbed to about 70 feet above the ground, or three times the height of 
the radio antenna mounted next to his house.  He then saw the airplane drift to the left, 
suddenly nose over and descend into the ground.  He also stated that the wings were "... 
rocking back and forth" as it descended.
He was given a model of an airplane and simulated the wing rocking.  
     The pilot's son also stated that he did not recall hearing any unusual engine noises from the 
airplane, but he was also exposed to the sound of the motorcycle that he was riding. He also did 
not recall observing anything unusual about the airplane as it was climbing, and he did not see 
any smoke or fire trailing from the airplane.
     The airplane impacted nose-down into a plowed corn field located about 225 feet north of 
the departure end of the runway, and about 335 west of the extended runway centerline.  The 
airplane was destroyed.  There was no fire.
     The accident occurred during the hours of daylight at 39 degrees 38.69 minutes North, and 
83 degrees 23.37 minutes West.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
     The pilot, age 49, was a certificated private pilot with a rating for single-engine land 
airplanes.  According to FAA records, the pilot was issued an FAA Third Class Medical 
Certificate on September 2, 1993, with no limitations.  The pilot's logbook was recovered and 
indicated that the pilot had logged total of 479 hours, including 390 hours in type.  The logbook 
Page 4 of 8BFO94FA086
also indicated that the pilot had logged 11 flight hours in type during the 30 days preceding the 
accident.    
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
     The airplane, a 1966 Cessna 150, was owned and operated by the pilot.  It was kept outside 
on the pilot's property.  The pilot operated that airplane with automotive fuel purchased from a 
local automotive gasoline station.
     An examination of the airplane's engine and airframe logbooks, and the pilot's personal 
airplane record, did not reveal any unresolved discrepancies prior to the accident flight. The 
logbooks indicated that the airframe had accumulated a total of 4,202 flight hours.  It had 
received an annual inspection on November 14, 1993, about 53 hours prior to the accident 
flight.  The engine, a Continental O-200-A, had accumulated 3,049 total operating hours, 
including 1,802 since it's last major overhaul.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
     Witnesses at the accident characterized the weather conditions as "perfect" and "fine."  The 
recorded wind speed at the Port Columbus International Airport, located 30 miles from the 
accident site, about the time of the accident were winds from 300 degrees magnetic at 7 knots.  
The departure runway was oriented along a magnetic bearing of 320 degrees.
     According to a Safety Board computer program used to determine sun and moon 
information,  the sun was located along a magnetic bearing of 293 degrees and at an altitude of 
12.1 degrees from the horizon at the time of the accident.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
     The airplane wreckage was examined at the accident site on June 3, 1994.  An additional 
examination occurred on June 4, 1994, at the Fayette County Airport, Washington Court 
House, Ohio, after the wreckage had been moved.
     The entire airplane was found in a nose-down position within the confines of its own 
dimensions. The magnetic bearing of the airplane's longitudinal axis was about 360 degrees.  
The airplane was embedded in the ground at an angle of about 50 degrees from the horizon.  
The tailcone was partially separated and resting on the ground.  There was no evidence of fire.
     All primary and secondary flight control surfaces were accounted for at the accident site.  No 
evidence was found to indicate a flight control deficiency.  The leading edges of both wings of 
the airplane exhibited evidence of crush damage.  The engine was crushed upward into the 
cockpit. The engine and propeller remained attached to the airframe and were embedded in the 
ground in a nose-down attitude.
     The electrically-driven flap actuator mechanism was examined; the examination revealed 
that the flaps were in the fully retracted position.
     Both wing fuel tanks were intact and several gallons of fuel were found inside.  A sample of 
the fuel was taken and sent for analysis.  The report of analysis (attached) indicated that the 
fuel was automotive gasoline with an alcohol additive.  No water or other contaminants were 
present.  The fuel mixture control was found in the full rich position.  The fuel selector valve 
was found in the ON position.  The fuel primer knob was in the locked position.
     An examination of the cockpit controls revealed the following:  About 2.7 inches of the 
Page 5 of 8BFO94FA086
throttle control shaft protruded from the panel and was bent downward.  The control yoke 
column was found in the full aft position.  The vertical speed indicator read 1,650 feet per 
minute rate of descent.  The magneto switch was selected to BOTH, and the electrical master 
switch was in the OFF position.
     The engine and propeller were examined.  No holes were found in the crankcase.  The 
bottom of the engine exhibited crush damage and the oil sump was deformed.  About two 
quarts of oil drained out of the sump; no contamination was noted.  The oil screen was 
removed and examined; light metal shavings were present.  Six sparkplugs were removed; all 
six contained a black wet oil residue on their electrodes.
     The propeller could be rotated through 360 degrees of rotation.  Crankshaft drive and valve 
train continuity was verified for all four cylinders during propeller rotation.  The number 1 
cylinder barrel assembly was removed and the interior of the engine was visible.  No evidence 
of heat distress was found.  Continuity of all connecting rods was verified.
     A compression check was performed on the engine during propeller rotation; all four 
cylinders produced compression.
     Both magnetos could be freely rotated and produced a spark when rotated.  Both impulse 
couplings engaged when rotated.
     The carburetor was separated from the intake manifold assembly and was partially attached 
to the engine.  The throttle linkage was connected to the carburetor but separated at impact.  
The carburetor heat control was found in the closed (cold) position. The mixture control was 
found against the full rich stops. The throttle butterfly valve was in the closed position. The 
carburetor was disassembled and examined.  The floats, venturi, jet and accelerator pump were 
intact.  The carburetor bowl was empty and wet with fuel.  The carburetor fuel screen was 
removed and examined; it was also wet with fuel and did not exhibit any evidence of 
contamination.  
     The two-bladed McCauley metal propeller was examined.  One blade exhibited evidence of 
some leading edge polishing and S- bending on the outboard 8 inches.  The other blade 
exhibited evidence of some leading edge polishing and some chordwise scratching.  This blade 
was bent aft about 30 degrees at its midspan.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
     An autopsy was performed on the pilot by Dr. Patrick M. Fardal, M.D., of the Franklin 
County Coroners Office, Columbus, Ohio, on June 3, 1994.  According to the autopsy report, 
the cause of death was "multiple blunt force injuries."
     A toxicological analysis was performed on specimens taken from the pilot by the FAA Civil 
Aeromedical Institute (CAMI), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  According to the toxicological 
report dated December 22, 1994, 0.318 ug/mL atropine was detected in the blood, and 0.727 
ug/mL atropine was detected in the lung.  No evidence of atropine was detected in the 
specimens from the liver, spleen, or brain.  According to Dr. Dennis V. Canfield of CAMI, 
atropine is a drug used by medical professionals for the revival of injured victims.  Dr. Canfield 
stated that because no atropine was detected in the liver, spleen, or brain, the intrusion of the 
drug occurred after the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
