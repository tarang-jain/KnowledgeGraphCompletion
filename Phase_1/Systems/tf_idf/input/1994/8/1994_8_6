Analysis 
AERIAL APPLICATION WORK WAS COMPLETED AT ONE LOCATION. THE AIRPLANE 
WAS IN CRUISE FLIGHT AT 700 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND TO ANOTHER LOCATION, 
WHEN A TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER OCCURRED. AN EMERGENCY DESCENT AND 
APPROACH WAS MADE TO A COTTON TURN ROW. DURING THE LANDING ROLL ON 
THE ROUGH TURN ROW, THE AIRPLANE GROUND LOOPED. EXAMINATION OF THE 
ENGINE REVEALED THE FAILURE OF A BEARING IN THE BLOWER SECTION CAUSED 
THE ENGINE TO SEIZE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER AS THE ENGINE SEIZED DUE TO A BLOWER BEARING 
FAILURE. A FACTOR WAS THE LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN FOR THE FORCED 
LANDING.

Factual Information
 On August 1, 1994, at 1900 central daylight time, an Air Tractor AT-401, N45297, was 
substantially damaged during a forced landing near McGehee, Arkansas.  The commercial pilot 
was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the aerial application flight.
The pilot and operator reported the following information.  The flight departed the Weatherly 
Farm near Kelso, Arkansas, at 1845. The airplane was being ferried to Jerome, Arkansas, for 
additional aerial application flights.  During cruise at 700 feet above the ground, a total 
mechanical loss of engine power occurred.  An emergency descent and approach was made to a 
cotton turn row.  During the landing roll on the rough turn row, the airplane ground looped. 
An examination of the engine by the FAA inspector and the operator revealed the engine was 
mechanically seized.  The operator reported a bearing failure in the engine blower section 
caused the power loss.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
