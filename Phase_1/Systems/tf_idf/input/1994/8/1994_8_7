Factual Information
 On August 1, 1994, at 1411 central daylight time, an Air Tractor AT-502, N9152C, was 
destroyed when it struck a pole and the ground near Bosco, Louisiana.  The airplane, owned 
and operated by Keahey Flying Service and flown by a commercial pilot, was on a local aerial 
application flight.  There was no flight plan filed and visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed.  The pilot received serious burn injuries.
The aircraft departed from the Columbia, Louisiana, Municipal Airport at 1315 central daylight 
time and proceeded to Bosco, Louisiana, for aerial application of pesticide to a cotton field. The 
pilot stated that he finished spraying the field in an east/west direction.  He further stated that 
he then started his "trim" passes in a north/south direction.  According to the pilot's enclosed 
statement, the right wing struck a pole about 4 feet from the top of the pole and about 6 feet 
inboard of the right wing "causing the aircraft to crash about 300 yards from the point of 
impact."  The airplane was consumed by post-crash fire.  A nearby witness pulled the pilot from 
the burning plane immediately after the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
