Analysis 
AS AN INSTRUCTOR (CFI) & STUDENT IN A CESSNA 172 WERE MAKING TOUCH-&-GO'S 
ON RUNWAY 14R, A BM-4 PILOT TRANSMITTED ON UNICOM THAT HE WAS 
APPROACHING FROM THE WEST FOR A BASE ENTRY.  REPORTEDLY, THE CESSNA 
PILOTS WERE TRANSMITTING THEIR POSITIONS ON UNICOM, ALSO.  THE BM-4 
SUBSEQUENTLY TURNED BASE TO FINAL BEHIND THE CESSNA & WAS SEEN 
CONVERGING ON THE CESSNA IN DISTANCE & ALTITUDE. IMPACT OCCURRED ON 
SHORT FINAL.  WITNESSES SAID THE AIRPLANES REMAINED TOGETHER, ROTATED 
TO THE LEFT & DESCENDED VERTICALLY TO THE GROUND.  THE BM-4 COLOR WAS 
WHITE WITH YELLOW TRIM & THE CESSNA WAS COLORED WHITE WITH BROWN 
TRIM.   YELLOW PAINT TRANSFER WAS OBSERVED ON THE UPPER LEFT WING 
SURFACE, AFT CABIN SUPPORT POST & AFT WINDSHIELD OF THE CESSNA.  LEADING 
EDGE DAMAGE OF THE RIGHT WING OF THE BM-4 WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO 
THE WIDTH OF THE AFT CABIN WINDOW OF THE CESSNA.  AN IMPACT SIGNATURE

WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE BM-4 RIGHT LANDING GEAR STRUT WIDTH.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
INADEQUATE VISUAL LOOKOUT BY THE PILOT OF THE HAWK BM-4, WHICH 
RESULTED IN HIS FAILURE TO SEE-AND-AVOID THE CESSNA 172. THE BM-4 PILOT'S 
NON-STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR ENTERING THE TRAFFIC PATTERN WAS A 
RELATED FACTOR.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
