1 Serious, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
THE STUDENT PILOT WAS RECEIVING INSTRUCTION IN THE BELL 47 HELICOPTER 
FROM A CERTIFIED FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR (CFI).  AFTER A  1.5 HOUR DUAL 
INSTRUCTION FLIGHT, THE STUDENT AND THE CFI  RETURNED TO THE DEPARTURE 
AIRPORT TO REFUEL, AND WERE PLANNING TO DEPART AGAIN FOR ANOTHER 
TRAINING FLIGHT.  AFTER LANDING, THE HELICOPTER WAS LEFT IDLING WITH THE 
RSP AT THE CONTROLS WHILE THE CFI EXITED THE HELICOPTER TO RETRIEVE THE 
FUEL TRUCK.  THE CFI RETURNED WITH THE FUEL TRUCK, RE-FUELED THE 
HELICOPTER AND WAS RETURNING THE FUEL HOSE TO THE TRUCK WHEN THE 
TURNING ROTOR BLADES STRUCK THE HOSE AND FUEL TRUCK.  THE HOSE IN TURN 
STRUCK THE CFI.  THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE TRUCK HAD BEEN 
PARKED ABOUT 3.5 FEET FROM THE TURNING ROTOR BLADES, AND COMPANY 
POLICY MANDATED A MINIMUM OF A 10 FOOT CLEARANCE.  RE-ENACTMENT OF THE 
HOSE STOWAGE TO THE SIDE OF THE FUEL TRUCK SHOWED A TENDENCY FOR THE 
HOSE TO DEFLECT UP INTO THE ROTOR TIP PATH PLANE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate clearance of the fuel truck from the aircraft, which 
resulted in the main rotor striking the fuel hose and truck during refueling operation.  A factor 
was the pilot's failure to follow company policy pertaining to the refueling of aircraft.

Factual Information
 On March 1, 1994, at about 1535 eastern standard time, a Bell 47G5 Helicopter, N7043J, 
owned and operated by Plymouth Copters, was substantially damaged during a refueling 
operation while the helicopter was idling at the Plymouth Airport, Plymouth, Massachusetts.  
The pilot at the controls was not injured, but the instructor pilot operating the fuel truck 
received serious injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  A flight plan had not 
been filed for the flight operating under 14 CFR 91.
    The rated student pilot (RSP), John Christopher, was receiving instruction in the Bell 47G5, 
to qualify him for insurance purposes for the Bell 47G2 that he had recently purchased.  The 
flight instructor/owner of Plymouth Copters Robert Dumas, and the RSP, departed the 
Plymouth Airport (PYM) in N7043J about 1400, for a local training flight.  
    After a 1 1/2 hour flight, they returned to PYM to refuel the helicopter, and were planning to 
depart again for another 1 1/2 hour training flight.  
    In his statement, the RSP stated:
    "...[Mr. Dumas] said that he would pull up along side of the helicopter, and re-fuel it without 
shutting it down.  I gave him a look of disapproval to which he responded, 'We do this all the 
time'.  I landed on the pad, the helicopter well centered...Mr. Dumas left the helicopter.  I 
began applying collective friction. Before I engaged cyclic friction Mr. Dumas had already 
pulled along side of the helicopter and re-entered the cabin.  He said to move the cyclic forward 
slightly and to hold it there, which I did.  I watched ...the re-fueling, and the stowing of the 
hose.  The fuel truck had side boards along its length approximately 6 feet above the ground.  
To stow the hose, Mr. Dumas fed the hose with his left hand over the top of the side boards 
while holding the nozzle with his right hand...My glance turned to the gauges when I felt an 
extreme shock through the cyclic accompanied by a loud bang.  The helicopter turned to the 
right as in a tail rotor failure,  I immediately chopped the throttle...." 
    According to the Flight Instructor's statement, after landing, he exited the helicopter to drive 
the fuel truck into position to refuel the helicopter while it was idling.  He returned with the 
fuel truck and positioned it outside of the main rotor tip path plane.  The flight instructor 
observed that the tip path plane had drifted down, and went to the RSP at the controls and told 
him to level the main rotor tip path plane.  
    The flight instructor further stated:
"...I refueled the helicopter and turned my back toward the helicopter, returning the fuel hose 
to the truck...The main rotor tip path plane must have been permitted to dip down by the pilot, 
low enough to hit the fuel hose as I carried it back to the truck,  which in turn struck me and 
began the sequence of events that resulted in the...damage to the helicopter."
    In the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector's report he stated that interviews 
with Plymouth Copters employees revealed that company policy mandates a minimum of a 10 
foot clearance between the fuel truck and the turning rotor blades.  With the helicopter 
centered on the helipad, the tip path plane clearance with the fuel truck was 3.44 feet.  
    The FAA Inspector's report further stated:
"...Robert Dumas is seventy four inches tall.  The distance from the ground to the top of the 
Page 4 of 6NYC94LA050
side boards on the fuel trick is seventy one and a half inches.  The optimum height of the main 
rotor disc is 111.66 inches...Under the best of conditions, the clearance available can be 
predicted at 30.16 inches.  We re- enacted the stowage of the hose assembly using an employee 
of Plymouth Copters who is seventy four inches in height.  Even under this controlled 
environment, the tendency was for the hose to deflect up from the top of the truck in excess of 
thirty inches...."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
