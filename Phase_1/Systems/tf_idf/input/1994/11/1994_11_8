Factual Information
 On November 2, 1994, at 1515 hours central standard time (CST), a Hughes 269-C helicopter, 
N9294F, operated as a business aircraft by Henkle Drilling and Supply, Inc., of Garden City, 
Kansas, contacted a pole with its rotor blades at the owner's facility one mile west of Garden 
City, Kansas.  The helicopter turned on its side and was substantially damaged.  There were no 
persons on board the helicopter during the accident and no injuries.  Visual meteorological 
conditions existed at the time of the accident and no flight plan was filed.  
The flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 91 and had originated from the Garden City 
Regional Airport at approximately 1445 CST.  The airline transport rated pilot had repositioned 
the helicopter and was awaiting a part to transport to a company site in Sublette, Kansas.  After 
landing at 1450 hours CST, the engine was placed at idle (approximately 1400 RPM), the rotor 
disengaged, and the pilot exited the helicopter.  Winds were 10 knots gusting to 20 knots.  The 
rotors engaged with no persons on board, and the helicopter struck a building.  
Post-crash inspection revealed that the belt tensioner was still in the disengaged position, and 
the collective was in the full up position.  Witnesses stated that the gusting winds were causing 
the static rotor blades to flap vertically.  As rotor blade pitch is increased, the engine 
anticipator tends to increase engine speed.  Maintenance and operations personnel stated that 
as engine speed increases, the drive belts are able to grab the drive pulleys.  Witnesses 
described hearing the engine operating at a high speed during the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
