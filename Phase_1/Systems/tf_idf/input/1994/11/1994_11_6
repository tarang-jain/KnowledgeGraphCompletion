Factual Information
 On November 2, 1994, about 1615 eastern standard time, a Cessna 152, N48720, collided with 
the ground, following an  in-flight collision with electrical transmission wires, near Rock Hill, 
South Carolina. The airplane was operated by Ksena Corporation under the provisions of 14 
CFR Part 91, and visual flight rules. A flight plan was not filed for the local, solo, instructional 
flight. The student pilot was not injured and the airplane was substantially damaged. 
Origination of the flight was the Rock Hill Airport, Rock Hill, South Carolina, about 1520.
     An emergency management official for South Carolina reported that the airplane struck 
electrical transmission wires, then came to rest, partially submerged, in the Catawba River. 
Three wires were severed about 50 feet above the ground. The operator of the airplane, and the 
emergency management official stated that the pilot did not report any mechanical 
malfunctions of the airplane.
     The pilot stated that he decided to "buzz" the Catawba River. While flying over a deserted 
stretch of the river about 30 feet above the surface, the airplane struck two power lines. Under 
the recommendation section of his report, the pilot said "Total lapse of judgement on my part."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
