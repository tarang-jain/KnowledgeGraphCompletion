Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On October 1, 1994, about 1900 central daylight time, a Cessna 150G, N3654J, was destroyed 
while maneuvering near Lamberton, Minnesota.  The solo private pilot sustained fatal injuries.  
The flight originated about 1857 on a farm road near the accident site with a planned 
destination of St. James, Minnesota.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the 
personal flight, conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.  No flight plan was filed.
According to witnesses, the pilot had been visiting with relatives, celebrating his sister's 25th 
wedding anniversary.  He took off, as he had previously landed, from the gravel road next to his 
brother-in-law's farm.  After takeoff, he made one pass north to south and a second pass west 
to east just south of the farm house.  
Witnesses stated the airplane was at an altitude of a few hundred feet.  As the pilot pulled up 
sharply, the nose of the airplane dropped, and the airplane began rotating to the right.  They 
reported the engine noise decreased but the engine continued to run during the descent.  The 
airplane impacted the terrain in a plowed field.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The NTSB on-scene investigation began on October 2, 1994, at 0930.  The wreckage was 
located in a field north of the Ervin Runk farm and east of the Donald Runk farm.  
A five by three foot crater, six inches deep was located two feet in front of the nose of the 
airplane.  The left wing was separated from the main wreckage and was located 27 feet to the 
south, oriented perpendicular to the fuselage.  The forward fuselage was crushed upward and 
aft to the aft door frames.  The empennage, aft of the cabin area, was bent 90 degrees to the 
right.  The right wing was crushed aft at a thirty degree angle from midspan out to the tip.
One blade of the propeller was bent aft approximately 30 degrees at midspan.  The tip of the 
other blade was bent slightly forward.  Minor torsional bending was evident.
Slight charring to surrounding vegetation was evident beneath the engine.  Witnesses reported 
they had extinguished a small postimpact fire using a hand held fire extinguisher.
The spark plugs were black and coated with carbon.  The left magneto sparked when it was 
rotated by hand.  The right magneto was partially melted and could not be functionally tested.
No evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunction was discovered.  Examination of engine and 
flight control system continuity revealed no anomalies.
A fuel sample from the left wing tank revealed clean, clear, green colored fuel.  The sample 
smelled similar to automobile fuel.  Testing of the fuel with a field test kit revealed it contained 
no water and greater than five percent alcohol.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
Autopsy of the pilot was conducted at the Immanuel-St. Joseph's Hospital, 1025 Marsh Street, 
P. O. Box 8673, Mankato, MN 56002- 2626.  Toxicological testing was negative for all tests 
conducted except 0.153 (ug/ml, ug/g) Chlorpheniramine detected in liver fluid and 0.478 
(ug/ml, ug/g) Chlorpheniramine detected in spleen fluid.
According to a NTSB National Resource Specialist, the therapeutic level for Chlorpheniramine 
Page 4 of 6CHI95FA001
is .016 to .070 (ug/ml, ug/g) in blood specimens.  Chlorpheniramine is listed in the Physicians' 
Desk Reference as an active ingredient in many nonprescription cold and allergy medications.  
Medications containing Chlorpheniramine warn "use caution when driving a motor vehicle or 
operating heavy machinery"
ADDITIONAL DATA/INFORMATION
Parties to the investigation were the Federal Aviation Administration Flight Standards District 
Office, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Cessna Aircraft Corporation, Wichita, Kansas.  
Following the on-scene portion of the investigation, the wreckage was released to Mr. Dewayne 
Malmgron, the manager of the St. James Airport.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
