Analysis 
AS THE LEVEL 6 THUNDERSTORM PASSED OVER THE AIRPORT FROM NORTHWEST 
TO SOUTHEAST, THE CAPTAIN ELECTED NOT TO TAKE OFF BECAUSE OF THE 
FALLING HAIL. AFTER WAITING ABOUT 30 MINUTES, THE FLIGHT TOOK OFF ON 
RUNWAY 35L. THE CAPTAIN REQUESTED A RIGHT TURN, AND WAS ASSIGNED A 
HEADING OF 080 DEGREES AND CLEARED TO CLIMB TO 20,000 FEET. THE AIRPLANE 
ENTERED THE OVERCAST AND ENCOUNTERED 'LIGHT HAIL.' AS IT TURNED ONTO ITS 
ASSIGNED HEADING, THE AIRBORNE WEATHER RADAR INDICATED HEAVY 
PRECIPITATION AHEAD. A REQUEST WAS MADE FOR A TURN FURTHER RIGHT. 
SUDDENLY, THE RIGHT WINDSHIELD SHATTERED, SENDING GLASS PARTICLES INTO 
THE FIRST OFFICER'S EYES. THE AIRPLANE IMMEDIATELY DESCENDED TO VISUAL 
METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, RETURNED TO THE AIRPORT, AND LANDED. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE CAPTAIN'S INACCURATE EVALUATION OF WEATHER CONDITIONS, AND HIS 
DECISION TO FLY INTO KNOWN ADVERSE WEATHER. A FACTOR WAS THE HAIL.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On October 1, 1994, approximately 1805 mountain daylight time, a Beech 1900D, N31YV, was 
substantially damaged during an inflight encounter with adverse weather near Denver, 
Colorado.  There were no injuries to the captain and 16 passengers, but the first officer 
sustained minor injuries.  Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed.
The following is based on interviews with the captain and first officer, and the pilot/operator 
report.  The airplane, flight 7658, operated by Mesa Airlines, Inc., d/b/a United Express, taxied 
to runway 35L at 1720, but was placed in the "penalty box" due to weather causing a traffic 
backlog.  It began to rain heavily and several wind shear alerts were issued.  When the flight 
was cleared to taxi onto the runway, the captain declined and decided to wait for better weather 
conditions.  Hail began to fall and the right engine was shut down to conserve fuel.  A Boeing 
727, later identified as United Air Lines flight 898, took off at 1748 and turned to the left.  
Shortly thereafter, at 1750, the United pilot advised the control tower that traffic should avoid a 
westerly departure.  The captain said the pilot sounded "thoroughly shaken."  When weather 
conditions improved and the crew noted no precipitation echoes on the weather radar through 
various tilt angles, flight 7658 took off at 1759.
Because of the previous pilot report, the captain requested a right turn after departure.  The 
flight was assigned a heading of 080 degrees and an altitude of 20,000 feet.  The airplane 
entered the overcast and it began to rain, followed by "light hail."  As the airplane was 
approaching 10,000 feet, the airborne weather radar indicated heavy precipitation ahead, and 
the crew requested a turn further to the right.  The airplane then encountered heavy hail and 
the right windshield "exploded," sending glass particles into the first officer's eyes and 
temporarily blinding him.  After telling air traffic control what had happened, the flight was 
cleared to land on any runway.  The captain descended into visual meteorological conditions 
and landed on runway 26R.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
The captain said that he personally obtained a weather briefing via computer prior to 
departure.  The reports indicated that visual meteorological conditions prevailed in Denver, 
Amarillo, and along the route.  He said the weather reports were not "real time," but were 
probably at least one hour or more old.  Asked why his dispatcher did not provide him with 
more timely weather information, the captain replied that his company operated under Federal 
Aviation Regulations Part 135 and did not have a dispatch office.  Obtaining weather reports 
and filing flight plans was done by the flight crew.
Weather and air traffic control studies were made by the Safety Board's Operational Factors 
Division.  These reports are attached as exhibits.
FLIGHT RECORDERS
Both cockpit voice and flight data recorders were removed from the airplane and were 
examined by the Safety Board's Engineering and Computer Services Division.  No 
extraordinary data was retrieved from the flight data recorder.  The ATC communications 
channel on the cockpit voice recorder was found to have been wired incorrectly when it was 
installed by the airplane manufacturer.  No cockpit communications transcript was made.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
