Analysis 
THE PILOT TOOK OFF AND REMAINED IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN. WITNESSES SAID 
HE HAD DIFFICULTY LOWERING THE LANDING GEAR AND BY THE TIME IT WAS 
FULLY EXTENDED, THE AIRPLANE HAD TURNED FINAL AND WAS HALFWAY DOWN 
THE RUNWAY. WITNESSES SAID POWER WAS INCREASED, THE NOSE PITCHED UP, 
THE LEFT WING DROPPED, AND THE AIRPLANE DOVE OR SPUN TO THE GROUND. 
THE PILOT'S BROTHER SAID THAT ON A PREVIOUS TEST FLIGHT, THE PILOT HAD 
MADE A FORCED LANDING WHEN THE PROPELLER FEATHERED, AND IT APPEARED 
TO HIM THE SAME THING HAPPENED ON THIS FLIGHT. THE PROPELLER 
DISASSEMBLY REPORT INDICATED THE BLADE ANGLE WAS '40 DEGREES TO 45 
DEGREES. . . CONSIDERED HIGH FOR A SLOW SPEED IMPACT.' THIS WOULD BE 
POSSIBLE IF 'THE CONFIGURATION'S OUTPUT CONTROL PRESSURE WAS NOT 
CAPABLE OF MAINTAINING BLADE ANGLE, AND THAT THE PROPELLER WAS 
SLIPPING TO COARSE PITCH.' NO OIL LEAKS NOR PROPELLER GOVERNOR 
ANOMALIES WERE FOUND. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
AN INADVERTENT PILOT-INDUCED STALL AT TOO LOW AN ALTITUDE TO EFFECT A 
SAFE RECOVERY. FACTORS WERE THE MALFUNCTIONING PROPELLER SYSTEM AND 
THE UNCOMMANDED FEATHERING OF THE PROPELLER.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On October 1, 1994, at 0942 central daylight time, a McMurtrie Jurca MJ-10, N379SF, was 
destroyed when it impacted terrain while maneuvering at the Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 
Municipal Airport.  The airline transport rated pilot was fatally injured.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed.
The following is collectively based on four written witness statements.  The aircraft took off, the 
landing gear was retracted, and the aircraft remained in the traffic pattern.  On base leg, the 
landing gear was lowered; however, the left main gear did not appear to extend completely.  
The landing gear eventually was completely lowered; however, the airplane was halfway down 
the runway.  The engine was heard to increase power as if the pilot was attempting to make a 
go-around.  The airplane pitched up to a nose high attitude, stalled, the left wing dropped, and 
the airplane dove to the ground.  One witness said the airplane made a "3/4-spin before 
impact."
During the investigation a video tape was provided to the investigator-in-charge to review.  
Although the last few seconds of the accident was not videotaped, the take off and cycling of the 
landing gear was captured and the engine sounds could be heard.
The pilot's brother, who assisted in building the airplane and who also witnessed the accident, 
stated that on a previous test flight several months earlier, the pilot was forced to execute a 
forced landing following an uncommanded propeller feathering.  He further stated that it 
appeared to him that the propeller had again feathered.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
According to the aircraft maintenance records, the propeller was overhauled on December 1, 
1992, and had not been used until it was installed on N379SF.  Maintenance records further 
indicated the propeller governor was replaced on July 22, 1994.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The accident site was located abeam, and approximately 150 feet to the right, of the departure 
end of runway 17.  The first wreckage noted was the airplane's propeller, located just outside 
the ground fire area, and 6 feet to the right of the wreckage distribution centerline.  All but one 
blade remained attached to the hub, and the hub remained attached to the gearbox.  The third 
propeller blade was located nearby.  In close proximity to the propeller were three ground 
disruptions.  The first disruption, arbitrarily labeled the 12 o'clock position, measured 47 
inches in length.  The second disruption at the 3 o'clock position measured 84 inches in length.  
The third disruption at the 9 o'clock position measured 44 inches in length.  Actual 
measurement from the propeller blade tip to the center of the hub was 45 inches.
There was a ground scar 18 feet, 10 inches long.  At the beginning of this scar were red lens 
fragments.  The scar terminated at the ground indentation containing the propeller hub.  The 
main body of wreckage lay 55 feet beyond, aligned on a magnetic heading of 275 degrees.  The 
left wing, although still attached to the fuselage via cables, was bent back 30 degrees.  Both 
wings bore fire damage, particularly in the area of the fuel tanks. 
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
Page 4 of 6FTW95FA001
An autopsy (T-374-94) was performed by the Oklahoma State Medical Examiner's Office.  
Toxicology protocol, conducted by FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI), revealed the 
presence of pseudoephedrine in blood and liver fluid.  According to a CAMI spokesman, 
pseudoephedrine is a common over-the-counter nasal decongestant, and is not contraindicated 
for flying.
TESTS AND RESEARCH
The McCauley propeller was disassembled and examined at their Vandalia, Ohio, facilities 
under the supervision of a FAA maintenance inspector.  According to the McCauley report, 
"Several impact marks found on propeller components indicate a blade angle range at impact 
of 40 degrees to 45 degrees, measured at the 30 inch reference station.  The blade angle range 
is considered high for a slow speed impact...  It is possible that the configuration's output 
control pressure was not capable of maintaining blade angle, and that the propeller was 
slipping to coarse pitch prior to impact.  (This would be) possible if the propeller, governor, oil 
transfer bearing, and oil flow output, were not compatible for this installation, or, if an oil 
pressure leak in the transfer system occurred."  Wreckage examination disclosed no evidence of 
oil leaks.
The Woodward propeller governor was disassembled and examined at their Rockton, Illinois, 
facility under the supervision of an FAA maintenance inspector.  According to the Woodward 
report, there were "no anomalies in appearance or function," and the unit was "operational in 
all conditions."
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
At the conclusions of these tests mentioned above, the wreckage andvarious components were 
returned and verbally released to the owner's representative.  A written release, dated January 
23, 1995, was sent to the owner's representative but was never returned.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
