Location:
KENOSHA, WI
Accident Number:
CHI94LA308
Date & Time:
09/01/1994, 2100 CDT 
Registration:
N2911
Aircraft:
THALMAN THORP T-18
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE AMATEUR BUILT AIRPLANE LOST ENGINE POWER SHORTLY AFTER LIFTOFF. 
THE PILOT WAS ABLE TO LAND THE AIRPLANE ON THE LAST 400' FEET OF RUNWAY, 
BUT WAS UNABLE TO STOP THE AIRPLANE BEFORE IT RAN OFF THE END AND 
NOSED-OVER. POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE AND AIRFRAME 
DISCOVERED NO PREIMPACT ANOMALIES. THE ENGINE WAS STARTED AND 
ACCELERATED TO A STATIC RPM OF 2200 WITH NO OBSERVED DEFICIENCIES. 
FIFTEEN MINUTES PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT, A WEATHER REPORTING STATION 13 
MILES SOUTH OF THE ACCIDENT SITE RECORDED A TEMPERATURE OF 50 DEGREES 
F., AND A DEWPOINT OF 47 DEGREES F. THIS TEMPERATURE/DEWPOINT 
COMBINATION FALLS IN THE SERIOUS ICING CATEGORY ON A CARBURETOR ICING 
PROBABILITY CHART.  THE PILOT REPORTED HE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO ATTEMPT 
AN ENGINE RESTART OR TO USE THE CARBURETOR HEAT CONTROL AFTER THE 
ENGINE LOST POWER. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to use carburetor heat in carburetor icing conditions. A factor associated with 
the accident is the prevailing carburetor icing conditions.

Factual Information
 On September 1, 1994, about 2100 central daylight time, a Bernard J. Thalman, Jr., 
experimental Thorp T-18 airplane, N2911, received substantial damage following a loss of 
engine power during takeoff from runway 6R at the Kenosha Regional airport, Kenosha, 
Wisconsin. The solo private pilot was not injured.  The local, 14 CFR Part 91 flight operated in 
visual meteorological conditions without a flight plan.
The pilot reported a complete loss of engine power when the airplane reached approximately 
100' AGL.  He said in a telephone interview on October 26, that he did not have time to use the 
carburetor heat, or to attempt an engine restart.  He said he was able to land the airplane on 
the last 400' of the runway, but was unable to stop the airplane before it ran off the end of the 
runway and nosed-over.
A postaccident examination of the engine, fuel system, carburetor heat control, and airframe, 
disclosed no preimpact mechanical anomalies.  The engine was started and accelerated to a 
static RPM of 2200 with no observed deficiencies.
A weather observation taken fifteen minutes prior to the accident at the Waukeegan, Illinois, 
airport (approximately 13 miles south of the accident site), recorded a temperature of 50 
degrees F., and a dewpoint of 47 degrees F.  The attached Carburetor Icing Probability chart 
places this temperature/dewpoint combination in the serious icing range.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
