Analysis 
THE PRIVATE PILOT AND FOUR PARACHUTISTS WERE ON BOARD THE AIRPLANE AS 
IT TAXIED FOR TAKEOFF.  THE WIND CONDITIONS WERE REPORTED BETWEEN 14 
AND 16 KNOTS.  THE PILOT STATED THAT HE ADDED FULL POWER, ACHIEVED 
FLYING SPEED, ROTATED, AND BEGAN TO CLIMB OUT.  HE STATED THAT THE 
AIRPLANE THEN ENCOUNTERED WIND SHEAR.  HE LOST CONTROL OF THE 
AIRPLANE AND IT DRIFTED INTO A TREE LOCATED ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE 
RUNWAY.  THE PILOT DID NOT REPORT ANY MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS AND 
STATED THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE INITIATED THE FLIGHT BECAUSE OF THE HIGH 
WINDS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE AIRSPEED DURING 
THE TAKEOFF.  A FACTOR RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT IS THE GUSTY WIND 
CONDITIONS.

Factual Information
 On April 2, 1994, about 1830 hours eastern standard time, N5868B, a Cessna 182, operated by 
the Thunderbird Sport Parachute Club, Inc., Versailles, Kentucky, impacted a tree during 
takeoff in Berea, Kentucky.  The airplane was destroyed.  The certificated private pilot and two 
passengers received minor injuries, and two other passengers were seriously injured.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed.  The local flight departed 
from the Berea-Richmond Lackey Field, a grass airstrip, and was conducted under 14 CFR 91.
     According to the pilot, the airplane was loaded with four parachutists for the purpose of 
conducting a sport parachute jump.  The pilot then taxied to the active runway and performed 
a "run up" with no abnormalities noted.  The pilot stated that he selected 10 degrees of flaps 
and lined up for takeoff on runway 21.  He added full power and obtained "enough airspeed for 
takeoff."  He stated that he rotated and began to climb, but encountered an "... air pocket or 
low level wind shear."  The airplane lost altitude, impacted a tree on the western edge of the 
runway, and burned.
     The pilot stated that the winds were gusting and that he   ". . . should have waited [until] the 
winds died down or reset the jump to a calmer day."  The pilot also stated that there were no 
pre-impact mechanical malfunctions or failures.
     The reported wind conditions at a weather observation facility located about 25 nautical 
miles north of the accident site about the time of the accident were 14 knots at 240 degrees 
magnetic.  The pilot estimated the wind conditions to be 12 knots gusting to 16 knots at 030 
degrees magnetic.
     According to a Federal Aviation Administration aviation safety inspector,  the owner of the 
airplane was seated in the right front seat during the accident.  He told the FAA safety 
inspector that the engine was producing full power and that the airplane did not have enough 
airspeed to take off.
      According to the FAA safety inspector, no pre-impact mechanical deficiencies were found 
during an examination of the wreckage at the accident site.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
