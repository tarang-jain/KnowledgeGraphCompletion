Factual Information
 On April 1, 1994, at 1253 central standard time, a Piper PA-36- 300, N3735E, registered to 
Carlson Aerial, Inc., collided with the terrain during the initial takeoff climb from runway 17 at 
the Beloit Municipal Airport, Beloit, Kansas, while on a personal flight.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed.  The pilot was seriously injured and the 
airplane was substantially damaged.  The flight was originating at the time of the accident.
The pilot reported that at an altitude of 150 feet a loss of engine power was experienced.  He 
continued to report, "The loss of power resulted in a stalled condition with insufficient altitude 
to recover."  The airplane descended into the roof of a hangar.  
One witness who saw the airplane takeoff stated it made a 60 degree bank, climbing right turn 
after takeoff to an altitude of about 300 feet.  According to this witness the airplane appeared 
to stall.  This witness stated, "Sounded like climb power at all times."  Another witness who 
recounted a similar accident scenario stated, "Sounded like full power on engine."
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector who traveled to the accident site 
reported slash marks were present in the hangar.  The aircraft wreckage was moved to 
Lubbock, Texas, and a teardown was performed which was overseen by an inspector from the 
Lubbock, Texas, Flight Standards District Office of the FAA.  This inspector reported there was 
no indication of any internal failure of the engine.
The fuel control unit was removed and sent to Allied Signal in Canada for testing.  The fuel 
pump was forwarded to Pratt & Whitney in Canada for testing.  The fuel control unit was bench 
tested and was found to perform "within the acceptable test limits."  The fuel pump could not 
be bench tested due to impact damage.  A teardown of the pump disclosed, "The pump element 
itself was found to be in a satisfactory condition."  The teardown of the fuel pump and the 
bench testing to the fuel control unit were overseen by an inspector from Transport Canada.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
