Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE EXPERIMENTAL AIRPLANE WAS PERFORMING TOUCH AND GO LANDINGS.  THE 
ENGINE WAS A 330 HORSEPOWER BUICK V-8, APPROVED FOR THE USE OF 
AUTOMOTIVE GASOLINE FUEL.  THE LOCATION OR TIME OF THE LAST REFUELING IS 
UNKNOWN.  SEVERAL WITNESSES DESCRIBED A CESSATION OF ENGINE NOISE, AND 
THE AIRPLANE DESCENDING VERTICALLY IN A SPIN.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF 
ROTATION ON THE PROPELLER AT IMPACT, AND WATER WAS FOUND IN THE 
CARBURETOR. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane, resulting in a stall-spin.  Factors were an 
inadequate preflight and the loss of engine power resulting from water contamination in the 
automotive fuel.

Factual Information
 On December 3, 1994, at 1330 central standard time (CST), an experimental airplane, 
N234PC, impacted level terrain in an open field, 3/4 miles southeast of the Chambers Airstrip 
(private), 2 miles southwest of the Lincoln Municipal Airport, Lincoln, Nebraska, and was 
substantially damaged. 
The private pilot and private pilot passenger both sustained fatal injuries.    
Visual meteorological conditions existed at the time of the accident and no flight plan was filed.  
The flight operated under 14 CFR Part 91 as a personal flight, had originated from the 
Chambers Airstrip approximately 1323 CST and was performing touch and go landings.  The 
pilot did not possess a current medical certificate, nor a current biennial flight review. 
Several witnesses described the airplane in the touch and go pattern, a cessation of engine 
noise, and falling straight down to the ground.  Witnesses described no indications that the 
airplane had skidded or moved upon hitting the ground.  The landing gear were imbedded 
vertically downward into the soft ground, with no indications of forward motion, according to 
witness statements.  The propeller blades and spinner did not exhibit any rotational damage.
Witnesses described the airplane in the landing pattern, at approximately 500 feet, and 
possibly on a base leg for landing.  Descriptions were of the "engine sputtering" and "going 
silent." Witnesses also described the wings "wobbling," and a vertical, nose low, rotating 
descent, consistent with descriptions of a spin.
The airplane was registered as an experimental, homebuilt airplane.  It was rebuilt from a 
destroyed 1946 Globe Swift model GC-1B, serial number 1068.  The pilot was also the mechanic 
who rebuilt the airplane as a Patrick Chambers, PC-1V8, serial number 001.  The engine was a 
Buick V-8 automotive engine, and was using automotive gasoline as fuel.  No information was 
available about where or when the airplane was last refueled.  
The airplane was granted an experimental airworthiness certificate by the Federal Aviation 
Administration on October 25, 1988.  The FAA airworthiness inspector on scene stated that 
water was present in the carburetor and carburetor accelerator pump.
Toxicological specimens were tested by the Federal Aviation Administration Civil Aeromedical 
Institute (CAMI).  All tests were negative except 10.000 mg/dl ethanol was detected in the 
vitreous fluid of the pilot.  No ethanol was detected in his blood or urine.  CAMI stated on 
March 21, 1995 that the vitreous fluid retains ethanol longer than the other two fluids, that the 
indication could be post-mortem formation, and that no impairment would be indicated by 
these results.
An autopsy was performed by the Lancaster County Coroner Office, Lincoln, Nebraska, on 
December 5, 1994.  Manner of death cited in the reports on both occupants was trauma, 
sustained in an aircraft accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
