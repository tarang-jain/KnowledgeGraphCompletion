Factual Information
 On February 2, 1994, at 1500 Pacific standard time, a Fokker DR- 1, N10717, collided in flight 
with another airplane while maneuvering near Auburn, Washington.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed.  The airplane was substantially 
damaged and the certificated Airline Transport pilot was not injured.  The flight had originated 
from the Evergreen Skyranch private airstrip near Auburn, on February 2, 1994, at 1430, as a 
personal flight.  The other airplane was not identified nor was there a report of another aircraft 
damaged at the time of the accident.
During a telephone interview and subsequent written statement, the pilot reported that after 
takeoff, he circled the airstrip several times and attained an altitude of approximately 2,000 
feet above ground level.  The airplane was leveled out and the pilot stated that he then heard a 
loud bang from the tail section.  The airplane pitched up and entered a spin to the left.  The 
pilot corrected with full right rudder, full right aileron control, and up elevator.  The pilot was 
able to recover control of the airplane and reported that rudder control was not effective.  The 
pilot headed back to the airstrip maintaining full right rudder and aileron control to maintain 
level flight.  The pilot was unable to turn the airplane to the right without the airplane entering 
a left spin, so he set up for an off airport landing.  The airplane collided with trees near the 
northeast end of the airstrip.
After the accident, the pilot reported that he found that all of the control cables were intact and 
functioning.  The rudder was found bent over 90 degrees to the left and the leading edge was 
damaged.  The pilot stated that "The rudder showed no sign of rust or old cracks at the failed 
joint.  So I have to think that I may have had a collision with a large bird as there are many seen 
flying in this area." 
An individual working in the area at the time of the accident reported that he heard the sound 
of airplanes overhead and looked up to see five small airplanes flying in formation and heading 
in a westerly direction.  The witness noticed that one of the airplanes was red and had three 
wings.  The witness reported that the other four airplanes were light colored or white.  A short 
time later, the witness heard engine noise again and looked up to see only two airplanes flying 
in formation.  One was the red airplane with three wings and the other was a slightly larger 
white airplane.  The red airplane looked to be directly under the white airplane and both were 
very close to one another.  The witness called to his co-workers to look at the two airplanes 
when the red airplane suddenly brought the nose up.  The witness stated that "The other plane 
jerked a little - I am fairly certain that the 2 (two) planes actually made contact."  The white 
airplane continued heading south and the red airplane started a rapid descent.  The witness 
then lost sight of the airplane behind some trees.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
