Factual Information
 On February 1, 1994, at 1600 mountain standard time, a Cessna 182P, N111RR, was 
substantially damaged during landing roll at Meeker, Colorado.  The pilot and his passenger 
received no injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for this personal flight which 
departed Steamboat Springs, Colorado, at 1515.  
According to a ground witness, the runway was dry and weather conditions were clear skies 
and calm winds, with a temperature of 9 degrees Fahrenheit.  
The pilot stated that after touch down during the landing roll, the aircraft suddenly veered left, 
exited the left side of the runway into snow and nosed over.
Witness marks on the runway and in the adjacent snow drifted left and exited the runway into 
the snow, and continued approximately 150 yards parallel to the runway.
Examination of the aircraft landing gear structure, wheels, brakes, tires, and nose wheel 
steering by a certified mechanic provided no evidence of a preaccident failure or malfunction. 
A review of the pilot's log provided additional information to that furnished in NTSB Form 
6120.1/2.  The pilot did all his training in the Steamboat Springs area and received his private 
certificate on June 14, 1993.  He had accrued 11.6 hours in the accident aircraft.  On September 
30, 1993, he had a propeller strike during landing at Steamboat Springs, in this aircraft.  A 
compilation of the pilot's experience is provided in this document.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
