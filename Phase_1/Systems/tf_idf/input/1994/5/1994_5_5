Analysis 
SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF, THE PILOT REQUESTED CLEARANCE TO RETURN FOR AN 
IMMEDIATE LANDING.  A WITNESS SAID THAT HE HEARD A METALLIC NOISE FROM 
THE PLANE AS IT PASSED OVERHEAD.  HE SAID THE PILOT MADE A STEEP RIGHT 
BANK TO LAND ON RUNWAY 29L; HOWEVER, THE PLANE IMPACTED BETWEEN THE 
PARALLEL RUNWAYS. AN EXAM OF THE ENGINE REVEALED 2 FINGER-TIGHT 
CYLINDER BASE NUTS & UNDERTORQUED BASE NUTS & CRANKCASE THROUGH-
NUTS. A TEARDOWN REVEALED THE CRANKSHAFT HAD FAILED FROM FATIGUE 
BETWEEN THE #3 & #4 CONNECTING ROD JOURNALS. A METALLURGICAL EXAM OF 
THE CRANKSHAFT REVEALED HIGH LOCALIZED STRESS-INDUCED FATIGUE CRACKS. 
THE ENGINE HAD ACCUMULATED 266 HRS OF FLIGHT TIME SINCE MAJOR 
OVERHAUL ON 1/11/91. THE PLANE HAD BEEN MODIFIED WITH 2 STC'S, 1 FOR 
INSTALLATION OF A RAYJAY TURBOCHARGER, ANOTHER FOR INSTALLATION OF A 
'BLACKMAC' PROPELLER. THE HOLDER OF THE PROPELLER STC REPORTED THE 
COMPANY WOULD NOT HAVE INSTALLED THE PROPELLER ON A TURBOCHARGED 
ENGINE, SINCE CERTIFICATION VIBRATORY TESTS WERE ONLY MADE ON NORMALLY 
ASPIRATED ENGINES. AFTER INSTALLATION ON 1/17/91, THE PROPELLER WAS 
REMOVED ON 3/19/91 FOR STATIC BALANCE & 'RE-INDEX PROP #1 BLADE 180 
DEGREES;' ON 3/28/91, IT WAS REMOVED FOR A BLADE ANGLE CHECK; AND ON 
5/23/91, IT RECEIVED A DYNAMIC BALANCE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
FATIGUE FAILURE OF THE ENGINE CRANKSHAFT; AND FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO 
MAINTAIN ADEQUATE AIRSPEED, WHILE MANEUVERING TO LAND, WHICH 
RESULTED IN A STALL AND COLLISION WITH THE TERRAIN.  FACTORS RELATED TO 
THE ACCIDENT WERE: THE UNDESIRABLE ENGINE/PROPELLER VIBRATION, AND 
THE LOOSE CRANKCASE AND CYLINDER BASE NUTS.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On May 1, 1994, at 1220 mountain daylight time, N1905Y, a Mooney M20E, was destroyed 
during a forced landing in Broomfield, Colorado.  The private pilot and passenger were fatally 
injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
Shortly after taking off from runway 11L at the Jefferson County Airport, the pilot requested 
clearance to make an immediate landing; he did not indicate the nature of his emergency.  A 
witness said he heard a loud metallic noise coming from the engine as the airplane passed 
overhead.  He said the pilot made a steep right bank in an attempt to land on runway 29L and 
impacted terrain.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
A ground scar was located abeam the 2,000 foot distance-to-go marker of runway 11L, between 
runways 11L and 11R.  Just beyond this scar was a 60 foot gouge in the earth, aligned on a 
magnetic heading 250 degrees.  At the end of this gouge was a 40 foot wide and 10 foot deep 
ravine.  The airplane was found on the bank of the ravine on a magnetic heading of 080 
degrees.
The propeller assembly remained attached to the engine but one blade was broken off.  All 
three blades exhibited chordwise scratches on the cambered surfaces and were S-curled 
midspan.  The empennage was severed just aft of the baggage compartment.  The left wing 
remained attached to the fuselage but had a circumferential crack at the inboard aileron hinge 
point.  The flap was broken off.  The right wing lay next to the fuselage but was twisted 180 
degrees.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
An autopsy was conducted by the Jefferson County Coroner's Office, Golden, Colorado.  In 
addition, FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI) conducted a toxicology screen.  Trace 
amounts of pseudoephedrine was detected in blood and urine, and guaiphenesin was detected 
in urine.  Acetaminophen was detected in blood (6.900 ug/ml, ug/g) and urine (152.600 
ug/ml. ug/g).  According to a CAMI toxicologist, acetaminophen is found to Tylenol; 
pseudoephedrine is a decongestant, and guaiphenesin is an expectorant.  On his most recent 
medical examination dated October 13, 1993, the pilot indicated he was taking medications 
that included acetaminophen and pseudoephedrine.  The toxicologist was unable to say 
definitively whether any of these medications, either taken singularly or together, may have 
been contributory to the accident.
TESTS AND RESEARCH
Engine disassembly revealed the crankshaft had failed at the crankcheek between numbers 3 
and 4 connecting rod journals.  The number 4 cylinder lower right base nut and the number 3 
cylinder upper left base nut were finger tight.  The upper right base nuts on numbers 2 and 4 
cylinders broke free approximately 400 inch-pounds.  The number 1 cylinder lower right and 
left base nuts and the number 3 cylinder lower right base nut loosened at less than 500 inch-
pounds.  All other base nuts loosened at less than 350 inch-pounds.  Metal shavings were 
found inside the left magneto mounting on the accessory case, on the oil suction screen, and in 
the oil sump.  There were two breaks on the bottom of the crankcase below the numbers 3 and 
Page 4 of 6FTW94FA141
4 cylinders.  The engine received a major overhaul on January 11, 1991.  Total engine time was 
4,412 hours: 266 hours since major overhaul and 11 hours since a 100-hour inspection.
The crankshaft was sent to NTSB's metallurgical laboratory for analysis.  According to its 
report, the crankshaft failed as the result of "fatigue cracking that originated from the radius on 
the aft end on the number 3 connecting rod journal and propagated through most of the 
crankcheek before final separation."  There was "no evidence of metallurgical or manufacturing 
defects" in the crankshaft. 
The airplane had been modified by two Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs).  The engine 
was equipped with a Rayjay turbocharger (SE32WE) and a McCauley "BlackMac" 3-blade 
propeller (SA704NE).  According to a spokesman for U.S. Propeller Service in East Haddon, 
Connecticut, holder of STC SA704NE, the company will not install the "BlackMac" propeller on 
an airplane with a turbocharged engine because certification vibratory tests were made on 
normally aspirated engines only.  No data exists for turbocharged engines.
Maintenance records indicate that after its installation on January 17, 1991, the propeller was 
removed on March 28, 1991, "for blade angle check," and on March 19, 1991, for "static 
balance" and "re-index prop #1 blade 180 degrees."  On May 23, 1991, the propeller received a 
"dynamic balance --- before .55 IPS, after .1 IPS."
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The wreckage was released to the owner's representative on May 3, 1994.  The crankshaft was 
released on August 15, 1994.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
