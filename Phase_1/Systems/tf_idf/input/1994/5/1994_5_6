Factual Information
 On May 1, 1994, between 0600 and 0900 mountain daylight time, a Grumman G-164A, 
N8559H, sustained substantial damage during takeoff from a private airstrip near Lindon, 
Colorado.  The pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for this local 
area aerial application flight, and no flight plan was filed. 
The accident site was on a farm near the unincorporated community of Last Chance, Colorado.  
According to the pilot, he had operated from this facility in the past and normally departed to 
the south.  On this flight, he said that due to the wind, he elected to depart to the north.  The 
field was soft due to recent rains and the takeoff roll was longer than anticipated.  As the 
aircraft became airborne, according to the pilot, it struck a fence and some trees and came to 
rest vertical on the nose.  The pilot said he was not injured and the hopper remained intact.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
