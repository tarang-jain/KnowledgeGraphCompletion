Factual Information
 On May 1, 1994, at 1615 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Beechcraft Bonanza airplane, 
N441B, registered to and operated by the Pilot-in-Command, experienced a non-mechanical 
engine failure and was forced to ditch in the water approximately 5 miles east of Gustavus, 
Alaska.  The personal flight, operating under 14 CFR Part 91, departed Juneau, Alaska, and the 
destination was Gustavus.  No flight plan was filed and visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed.  The Private certificated Pilot-in-Command and his passenger were not injured and 
the airplane sank in the water.
     According to the Pilot-in-Command, he was attempting to use up the fuel in the auxiliary 
fuel tanks.  He stated that he felt the engine failed at the same time he switched to the left main 
fuel tank.  The airplane came to rest between the low and high tide lines. 
     According to Ned Horne, FAA, FSDO 05, Juneau, Alaska, the Pilot-in-Command informally 
admitted that the engine did not fail due to a mechanical reason but due to fuel 
mismanagement.
     The Pilot-in-Command did not submit an NTSB 6120.1/2.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
