Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND HAD FLOWN APPROXIMATELY 2.3 HOURS AFTER HIS 
INITIAL DEPARTURE WITH 45 GALLONS OF FUEL IN THE AMPHIBIOUS FLOAT 
EQUIPPED AIRPLANE.  HIS ESTIMATION OF FUEL CONSUMPTION WAS 39 GALLONS 
PER HOUR (GPH) AT TAKEOFF POWER AND 23 GPH AT CRUISE. SEVERAL TOUCH AND 
GO LANDINGS WERE PERFORMED DURING THE FLIGHT.  WHILE IN CRUISE FLIGHT A 
TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER OCCURRED AND A FORCED LANDING WAS MADE ON 
A GRAVEL ROAD.  DURING LANDING, THE FLOAT NOSE WHEELS DUG INTO SOFT 
GRAVEL AND THE AIRPLANE FLIPPED OVER.  POST CRASH INVESTIGATION 
REVEALED NO ENGINE ANOMOLIES, NO EVIDENCE OF FUEL IN THE TANKS, NOR ANY 
INDICATION OF FUEL SPILLAGE ON THE GROUND.  THE PILOT STATED HE BELIEVED 
HE EXHAUSTED HIS FUEL SUPPLY. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S FAILURE TO PERFORM ACCURATE FUEL CONSUMPTION 
CALCULATIONS.  A FACTOR WAS THE SOFT GRAVEL ROAD LANDING AREA.

Factual Information
 On May 1, 1994, at 2020 hours central daylight time, an amphibian Helio H-800, N4104D, 
operated by T. J. Farms of St. Cloud, Minnesota, was substantially damaged 10 miles northeast 
of St. Cloud Municipal Airport, St. Cloud, Minnesota.  The pilot experienced a total loss of 
engine power and made a forced landing on a gravel road. The amphibious float equipped 
airplane went over an embankment, dragged a float tip in soft gravel, and came to a stop 
upside down.  The private pilot was uninjured.  Visual meteorological conditions existed at the 
time of the accident and winds were calm.  The flight originated at Princeton Municipal 
Airport, Princeton, Minnesota, at 2015 hours central standard time to reposition the airplane 
to a private strip at Long Lake, southeast of St. Cloud, Minnesota.  No flight plan was filed.
Installation of amphibious floats had just been completed on the airplane.  The pilot stated he 
had departed Cambridge Municipal Airport, Cambridge, Minnesota, 2.3 tachometer hours 
earlier with an estimated 45 gallons of fuel, performed touch and go landings, and was on his 
final leg of this flight.  The pilot also stated he believes he exhausted his fuel supply.  The fuel 
consumption of the Lycoming IO-720A engine installed on the H-800 is 33 gallons per hour 
(gph) at takeoff rated power and 23 gph at 75% cruise power as per Lycoming data.  This was 
confirmed by the pilot and FAA inspector on scene.  Post crash investigation revealed no fuel in 
the tanks, nor any indication of fuel spillage on the ground below the wreckage.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
