Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Winamac, IN
Accident Number:
CHI03LA187
Date & Time:
07/02/2003, 1008 CDT 
Registration:
N6315P
Aircraft:
Piper PA-24
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
5 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane was damaged during a forced landing in a rough plowed field following a loss of 
engine power during cruise flight.  Examination of the engine revealed that the crankshaft gear 
retaining bolt was missing and the gear's anti-rotation pin was sheared.  The oil pan of the 
engine was examined and no bolt was found.  The crankshaft gear retaining bolt was not found 
within the engine.  A review of the maintenance records revealed that the engine was last 
overhauled on April 6, 1986, and had accumulated 522 hours time in service since the 
overhaul.  No subsequent logbook entries were noted that indicated removal of the crankshaft 
gear or retaining bolt.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power due to the improper installation of the crankshaft gear due to the 
omission of the retaining bolt and subsequent shear failure of the anti-rotation pin.  The 
unsuitable terrain encountered,  and the rough field were factors.

Factual Information
On July 2, 2003, at 1008 central daylight time, a Piper PA-24, N6315P, piloted by an airline 
transport pilot, sustained substantial damage during a forced landing following an in-flight loss 
of engine power near Winamac, Indiana.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the 
time of the accident.  The pilot and his four passengers reported no injuries.  The 14 CFR Part 
91 personal flight was operating on an IFR flight plan.  The flight departed from Plymouth, 
Michigan, at 0819, with an intended destination of Perryville, Missouri.
The airplane's engine stopped producing power during cruise flight.  The pilot was given radar 
vectors to the Arens Field Airport (RWN), Winamac, Indiana.  The pilot was not able to reach 
RWN and executed a forced landing in a rough plowed field.
A postaccident examination was conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration.  During 
the initial examination of the airplane's engine, valve train continuity could not be established.  
Rotation of the crankshaft produced no movement of the valve train components.  A 
subsequent examination of the accessory section of the engine revealed that the crankshaft 
gear retaining bolt was missing and the gear's anti-rotation pin was sheared.  The oil pan of the 
engine was examined and no bolt was found.  The crankshaft gear retaining bolt was not found 
within the engine.
A review of the maintenance records revealed that the engine was last overhauled on April 6, 
1986, and had accumulated 522 hours time in service since the overhaul.  No subsequent 
logbook entries were noted that indicated removal of the crankshaft gear or retaining bolt.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
