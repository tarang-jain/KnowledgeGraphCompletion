Analysis 
The pilot said he received instructions to land on runway 28.  The pilot set up for a right 
downwind, base turn , and final approach.  The pilot reported, "On final, I had to crab about 20 
degrees to the right and lineup for touchdown."  The pilot said that in the flare, he transitioned 
to a slip, and touched down.  The pilot said that just after touchdown, a wind gust picked his 
airplane up about 10 feet off the runway and rolled the airplane into a 20 degree left bank.  The 
pilot said he attempted to go around, but was unable to level the wings or climb.  The pilot said 
the wind blew his airplane off of the runway.  About 35 feet left of the runway's edge, the 
airplane's left wing struck the terrain and the airplane "cartwheeled."  An examination of the 
airplane revealed no anomalies.  Reported winds at the time of the accident were 060 degrees 
at 6 knots, gusting to 30 knots.  A peak wind of 360 degrees at 30 knots was recorded 1 minute 
after the accident time.  Density altitude was 9,152 feet msl.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control during landing.  Factors contributing to the 
accident were the gusting crosswinds and the high density altitude.

Factual Information
On July 1, 2003, at 1317 mountain daylight time, a Mooney M20C, N2686W, piloted by a 
private pilot, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain during landing at Centennial 
Airport (APA), Englewood, Colorado.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of 
the accident.  The personal  flight was being conducted on a visual flight rules flight plan under 
the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91.  The pilot reported no injuries.  The cross-country flight 
originated at Mason City, Iowa, at 0930 central daylight time, and was en route to Denver, 
Colorado. 
In his written statement, the pilot received instructions from APA air traffic control tower to 
land on runway 28 (4,903 feet by 62 feet, dry asphalt).  The pilot set up for a right downwind, 
base turn , and final approach.  The pilot reported, "On final, I had to crab about 20 degrees to 
the right and lineup for touchdown."  The pilot reported that in the flare, he transitioned to a 
slip and touched down.  The pilot said, "Shortly after touchdown, about 2 seconds, a wind gust 
picked me up about 10 feet off the runway and put me in about a 20 degree bank to the left."  
The pilot said he attempted to go around, but was unable to level the wings or climb.  The pilot 
said the wind blew his airplane off of the runway.  About 35 feet left of the runway's edge, the 
airplane's left wing struck the terrain and the airplane "cartwheeled." 
An examination of the airplane showed the right main landing gear pushed upward through 
the wing.  The left wing was bent upward and aft, starting at the flap and proceeding outboard 
to the tip.  The bottom fuselage was buckled, starting at the trailing edges of the flaps and 
proceeding aft to the empennage.  The horizontal stabilizer was bent and buckled aft.  An 
examination of the engine, engine controls and other airplane's systems revealed no anomalies.
Weather at the time of the accident was reported as sky conditions scattered 9,000 feet, 
scattered 12,000 feet, broken 18,000 feet, visibility 10 statute miles, temperature 90 degrees 
Fahrenheit (F), dew point 32 degrees F, altimeter 30.06 inches of Mercury, winds 060 degrees 
at 6 knots, gusting to 30 knots.  Remarks:  peak wind recorded at 1318, was 360 degrees at 30 
knots, virga distant southeast.  Density altitude was 9,153 feet mean sea level.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
