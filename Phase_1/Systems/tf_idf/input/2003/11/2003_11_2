Analysis 
The airplane was destroyed when it impacted the terrain during landing approach.  The 
airplane came to rest about 1,000 feet short of the intended landing runway.  According to the 
air traffic controller (ATC), the pilot taxied and called for departure at 1543. The airplane was 
cleared for takeoff and was to maintain a  southwest heading after takeoff.  The controller 
stated that the pilot called to return to the field at 1545.  The controller asked the pilot if 
anything was wrong, because of the brief duration of the flight.  The controller stated that at 
this time the pilot reported no problems.  At 1546, the airplane was cleared to land.  At 1547, 
the pilot indicated a gear problem and requested to circle the field.  At 1550, the pilot informed 
the controller that "everything looks ok."  The airplane was again cleared to land.  At 1552, the 
airplane crashed approximately 1/2 mile south of runway 36.  No pre-impact defects were 
found with respect to the aircraft during a post-accident examination.  The reported winds 
were from 090 degrees at 5 knots.

Factual Information
On November 1, 2003, at 1552 eastern standard time, an experimental amateur-built Master 
BD5B airplane, N515KH, piloted by a private pilot, was destroyed when it impacted the terrain 
during landing approach at the Cherry Capital Airport (TVC), Traverse City, Michigan.  The 
airplane came to rest about 1,000 feet short of runway 36 (5,107 feet by 150 feet, asphalt).  The 
14 CFR Part 91 personal flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions without a 
flight plan.  The pilot was fatally injured.  The local flight originated at 1543.
According to the air traffic controller at TVC tower, the pilot taxied and called for departure at 
1543.  The airplane was cleared for takeoff and was to maintain a  southwest heading after 
takeoff.  The controller stated that the pilot called to return to the field at 1545.  The controller 
asked the pilot if anything was wrong, because of the brief duration of the flight.  The controller 
stated that at this time the pilot reported no problems.  At 1546, the airplane was cleared to 
land.  At 1547, the pilot indicated a landing gear problem and requested to circle.  At 1550, the 
pilot informed the controller that "everything looks ok."  The airplane was again cleared to 
land.  At 1552, the airplane crashed approximately 1/2 mile south of runway 36.
The accident aircraft was an amateur-built Master BD5B, serial number 474.  The BD5B is an 
experimental category airplane with 1 seat.  The accident aircraft was powered by a Honda 
CX500 engine rated at 60 horsepower powering a pusher propeller.  The accident aircraft was 
issued its registration on July 15, 2003, pending a N number change, and received its 
airworthiness certificate on October 20, 1991.
An investigator from the Federal Aviation Administration conducted a post-accident inspection 
of the airplane.  No pre-impact defects were found.
The reported winds at the time of the accident were from 090 degrees at 5 knots.
An autopsy was performed on the pilot at Spectrum Health, Grand Rapids, Michigan,  The 
Federal Aviation Administration's Civil Aeromedical Institute prepared a Forensic Toxicology 
Fatal Accident Report on the pilot.  The report indicated SALICYLATE found in urine.  
Salicylate is found in Aspirin.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
