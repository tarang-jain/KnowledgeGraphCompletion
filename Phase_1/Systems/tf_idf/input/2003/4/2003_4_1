Aviation Incident Final Report
Location:
Eufaula, AL
Incident Number:
ATL03IA073
Date & Time:
04/01/2003, 1030 CST 
Registration:
N696SP
Aircraft:
Cessna 182P
Aircraft Damage:
Minor
Defining Event:
Injuries:
3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The purpose of the personal flight was undetermined.  While in cruise flight at 5000 feet, the 
pilot noticed the elevators on the canard wings vibrating abnormally.  The vibrations increased 
throughout the airplane and the left canard was observed hanging down.  The pilot reported 
the airplane's condition to Columbus Approach Control, and requested radar vectors to the 
nearest airport, Weedon Field, Eufaula, Alabama. The flight landed without further incident.  
The airplane was a 1973 model Cessna 182P.  It was refurbished in 1998 when the canard was 
added through STC #SA485SW.  The pilot did report the airplane having a mechanical 
malfunction with the nose control assembly left hand canard elevator.  The part had a total 
time of 453 hours on it. The post-landing examination of the airplane revealed a separation of 
the left canard elevator bell crank from the elevator. The bell crank fasteners were intact.  
Further examination of the airplane revealed the end rib for the left canard flap was fractured 
at the location where the left control rod attachment bracket was attached.  Wear was observed 
on the left control rod end fitting.  The fatigue features emanated from multiple origins at both 
the exterior and interior sides of the end rib, consistent with reverse-bending fatigue.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
Fatigue failure of end rib for the left canard flap.
Findings
Occurrence #1: AIRFRAME/COMPONENT/SYSTEM FAILURE/MALFUNCTION
Phase of Operation: CRUISE

Factual Information
On April 1, 2003 at 1030 central standard time, a Cessna 182P, N696SP, registered to and 
operated by a private pilot, sustained structural flight control damage while flying at cruise 
altitude near Eufaula, Alabama. The personal flight was operated under the provision of Title 
14 CFR Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight plan was 
filed. The canard modified airplane sustained minor damages. The commercial pilot and 
passengers were not injured. The flight departed Tishomingo County Airport, Belmont, 
Mississippi, at 0900.
The purpose of the personal flight was undetermined, however the flight was enroute to Cook 
County Airport in Adel, Georgia.  According to the pilot, while in cruise flight at 5000 feet, the 
he noticed the elevators on the canard wings vibrating abnormally.  The vibrations increased 
throughout the airplane and the left canard was observed hanging down.  The pilot reported 
the airplane's condition to Columbus Approach Control, and requested radar vectors to the 
nearest airport, Weedon Field, Eufaula, Alabama. The flight landed without further incident. 
The airplane was a 1973 Cessna 182P.  It was refurbished in 1998 when the canard was added 
through STC #SA485SW.  The pilot did report the airplane having a mechanical malfunction 
with the nose control assembly left hand canard elevator.  The part had a total time of 453 
hours on it.  
The examination of the airplane revealed a separation of the left canard elevator bell crank 
from the elevator. The bell crank fasteners were intact.  Further examination of the airplane 
revealed the end rib for the left canard flap was fractured at the location where the left control 
rod attachment bracket was attached.  Several cracks were observed in the attachment flange 
areas of the attachment frame.  The left control rod was bent in the threaded region adjacent to 
the forward rod end fitting.  Wear was observed on the left control rod end fitting.   In many 
areas the fractures of the end rib corresponded to the profiles of the nut plates that were 
riveted to the internal side of the flap end rib.  The fracture features included step fractures 
between planes and these features are consistent with fatigue.  The fatigue features emanated 
from multiple origins at both the exterior and interior sides of the end rib, consistent with 
reverse-bending fatigue.  The right control rod attachment bracket was removed and upon 
inspection, cracks were observed on the right canard flap end rib.  Cracks around one of the nut 
plates were opened and had fatigue features similar to those observed on the left canard end 
rib extending across the thickness of the end rib.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
