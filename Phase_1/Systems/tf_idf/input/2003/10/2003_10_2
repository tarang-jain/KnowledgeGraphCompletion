Location:
Saint Marys, GA
Accident Number:
ATL04LA001
Date & Time:
10/01/2003, 1803 EDT 
Registration:
N1928J
Aircraft:
Johnson Walter A Hornet
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
According to witnesses in the area, the airplane had been circling when they heard the engine 
sputter. The airplane descended nose down behind a stand of trees and they heard a "boom". 
Several witnesses in the area telephoned the 911-operator and reported the accident. 
Examination of the wreckage on-scene found the airplane in a nose down attitude. 
Examination of the engine found one of the two sparkplugs out of its cylinder hanging by the 
sparkplug wire. During a telephone interview with the brother of the pilot he stated that about 
15 to 20 hours prior to the accident they had done some maintenance on the engine including 
changing the spark plugs. He further stated that he believes that the spark plugs were not 
tightened adequately which allowed one to "blow out causing the loss of engine power".
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power due to improper maintenance and the pilot's failure to maintian 
airspeed during the attempted forced landing that resulted in a stall.

Factual Information
On October 1, 2003, at 1803 eastern daylight time, a Walter A. Johnson homebuilt Hornet 
experimental airplane, N1928J, registered to and operated by the non-certificated pilot, 
collided with the ground following a loss of engine power in St. Mary™s, Georgia. The personal 
flight was operated under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91, and visual flight rules. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The non-certificated pilot 
sustained fatal injuries and the airplane was substantially damaged. The flight originated from 
a private grass strip in St. Mary™s, Georgia, at an undetermined time.
According to witnesses in the area, the airplane had been circling when they heard the engine 
sputter. The airplane descended nose down behind a stand of trees and they heard a "boom". 
Several witnesses in the area telephoned the 911-operator and reported the accident. 
Examination of the wreckage on-scene found the airplane in a nose down attitude. 
Examination of the engine found one of the two sparkplugs out of its cylinder hanging by the 
sparkplug wire. During a telephone interview with the brother of the pilot he stated that about 
15 to 20 hours prior to the accident they had done some maintenance on the engine including 
changing the spark plugs. He further stated that he believes that the spark plugs were not 
tightened adequately which allowed one to "blow out causing the loss of engine power". 
The Division of Forensic Sciences, Georgia Bureau of Investigation, State of Georgia conducted 
a postmortem examination of the pilot on October 2, 2003. The reported cause of death was 
"Blunt Force Injury, and the Manner of death was Accident". The Forensic Toxicology Research

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
