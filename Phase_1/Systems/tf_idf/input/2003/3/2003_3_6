Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The airplane collided with obstacles during an aborted takeoff from a private dirt strip that was 
2,500 feet long.  During the instructional flight, the instructor and student were practicing 
touch-and-go takeoffs and landings.  On the third touch-and-go, the instructor felt that they 
did not have enough power to clear trees at the end of the runway.  He aborted the takeoff and 
the airplane went off the end of the runway and into heavy brush and small trees.  The Federal 
Aviation Administration inspector examined the engine and airframe, and noted no 
mechanical malfunctions.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the CFI's inadequate supervision and delayed decision to abort the takeoff resulted in the 
runway overrun.

Factual Information
On March 1, 2003, about 1100 mountain standard time, a Piper PA-18-150, N62712, collided 
with obstacles during an aborted takeoff from a private dirt strip near Chandler, Arizona.  
Chandler Air Service operated the airplane under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91.  The 
certified flight instructor (CFI) and student pilot were not injured.  The airplane was 
substantially damaged.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had 
been filed.  The instructional flight departed Chandler about 1030.
In a written statement, the CFI stated that while executing a touch-and-go, the airplane didn't 
feel like it was getting full power, and he elected to abort the takeoff.  The airplane overran the 
runway that was 2,500 feet long, and went into desert terrain, colliding with bushes and small 
trees.
Examination of the airplane by Federal Aviation Administration inspectors revealed no 
discrepancies with the airframe or the engine.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
