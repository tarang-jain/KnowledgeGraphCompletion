Location:
New Hudson, MI
Accident Number:
CHI03LA076
Date & Time:
03/01/2003, 1810 EST 
Registration:
N123JL
Aircraft:
Cessna T210L
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane sustained substantial damage when it impacted terrain while on approach to land.   
The pilot stated that he was a little high on final approach, so he reduced the throttle and 
lowered the nose.  He reported that when the airplane was 200 to 300 feet from the end of the 
runway, at a ground speed of 83 knots, the nose of the airplane veered to the left.  The pilot 
reported he was unable to realign the nose of the airplane using the rudder, and then the left 
wing stalled.  He reported he was able to get the wings almost level prior to the airplane 
impacting ground.  The airplane came to rest approximately 50 to 70 feet south of the runway, 
and 50 to 60 feet prior to the approach end of the runway.  Examination of the airplane showed 
control surface continuity.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control which resulted in the airplane stalling while on 
final approach.

Factual Information
On March 1, 2003, at 1810 eastern standard time, a Cessna T210L, N123JL, impacted terrain 
following a loss of control while on final approach to runway 25 at the Oakland Southwest 
Airport (Y47), New Hudson, Michigan.  The private pilot received minor injuries.  The airplane 
was substantially damaged.  The 14 CFR Part 91 flight was operating in visual meteorological 
conditions.  An IFR flight plan was filed, but was cancelled prior to the accident.  The flight 
originated from Traverse City, Michigan, at 1645.
The pilot reported that he flew the VOR-A approach, which brought him right over the airport.  
He cancelled his IFR flight plan and circled to land on runway 25.  He stated that he had a 
crosswind from the left, but the winds were light.  The pilot stated that he was a little high on 
final approach, so he reduced the throttle and lowered the nose.  He reported that when the 
airplane was 200 to 300 feet from the end of the runway, at a ground speed of 83 knots, the 
nose of the airplane veered to the left.  The pilot reported he was unable to realign the nose of 
the airplane using the rudder, and then the left wing stalled.  He reported he was able to get the 
wings almost level prior to the airplane impacting ground.  The airplane came to rest 
approximately 50 to 70 feet south of the runway, and 50 to 60 feet prior to the approach end of 
the runway.
A Federal Aviation Administration airworthiness inspector conducted an on-scene 
examination of the airplane.  The examination showed control surface continuity.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
