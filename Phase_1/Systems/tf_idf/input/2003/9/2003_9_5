Location:
Fajardo, PR
Accident Number:
MIA03LA176
Date & Time:
09/01/2003, 1130 AST 
Registration:
N8578U
Aircraft:
Cessna 172F
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
According to the pilot, after taking off, at an altitude of about 300 feet, the airplane's engine 
lost power. The pilot performed a 180-degree turn back to the runway, but due to the low 
altitude was unable to reach the runway. He elected to land in a field about 1/2 mile from the 
runway. The pilot explained it had been close to 3 weeks since the airplane had last been flown. 
He said he drained large quantities of water from  both the left and right wing fuel tank sump 
ports. He fueled the airplane with a total of about 29 gallons of 100 LL aviation fuel and 
drained a total of a gallon of fuel from both wing  tanks, with "no" indication of water in the 
fuel. The individual who recovered the airplane from the field stated when up righting the 
engine, a noticeable amount of water poured out of the carburetor.  An Airframe and Power 
plant mechanic stated to the Federal Aviation Administration inspector that when the 
carburetor bowl drain plug was removed, only water came out of it, no fuel at all.  At the time of 
the accident no water was utilized at the seen.  Weather reports support that there was no rain 
in the area between the accident and the time the airplane was removed from the farm.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate aircraft preflight resulting in the airplane being operated with water 
contamination in the fuel system, and the loss of engine power.

Factual Information
On September 1, 2003, about 1130 Atlantic standard time, a Cessna 172F, N8578U, owned and 
operated by an individual, lost engine power, and impacted with the ground during a forced 
landing, near Fajardo, Puerto Rico.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time, and 
no flight plan was filed.  The personal flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.  The airplane 
was substantially damaged.  The airline transport-rated pilot reported no injuries.  The flight 
was originating at the time.
According to the pilot's written report, after taking off at an altitude of about 300 feet the 
airplane's engine lost power. He elected to performed a power off landing in a cane field, the 
nose wheel of the airplane got caught in a ditch which resulted in the airplane coming to a stop 
upside down. 
A witness stated he watched N8578U take off, and was climbing out  when he heard the engine 
"sputter about two times". The airplane continued to climb before the engine "quit". He 
observed the airplane bank left and right several times before making a "sharp" left turn about 
180 degrees. He lost site of the airplane just before it hit the ground, as he reached the accident 
site he observed a man getting out of the upside down airplane.
In a phone conversation with the NTSB investigator-in-charge a couple of days after the 
accident, the pilot explained it had been close to 3 weeks since the airplane had been flown. He 
went on to explain, that he drained large quantities of water from both the left and right wing 
fuel tank sump ports. He fueled the airplane with a total of about 29 gallons of 100 LL aviation 
fuel and drained a total of a gallon of fuel from both wing  tanks again with "no" indication of 
water in the fuel. He also stated, the engine run up check prior to takeoff went "uneventful".
The individual who recovered the airplane from the field stated he removed the engine and 
wings from the fuselage to facilitate transportation of the airplane, when up righting the 
engine, a noticeable amount of water poured out of the carburetor. An airframe and 
powerplant mechanic stated to the Federal Aviation Administration inspector that when the 
carburetor bowl drain plug was removed, only water came out of it, no fuel at all.
The Federal Aviation Administration inspector stated that the pilot said after loss of engine 
power, he maneuvered the airplane 180 degrees in an attempt to return to the runway. Due to 
the low altitude, he was forced to land in a nearby farm. At the time of the accident no water 
was utilized at the seen. Weather reports support that there was no rain in the area between the 
accident and the time the airplane was removed from the farm.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
