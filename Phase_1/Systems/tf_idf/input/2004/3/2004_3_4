Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that he was practicing night instrument landing system in visual conditions 
when during the third practice approach, the aircraft collided with an object.  The pilot broke 
off the approach and returned to his base airport where it was determined that the left wing 
came in contact with a tree.  Air traffic communications and radar data indicated that the 
aircraft was established on the localizer during the three approaches, however, was below the 
minimum descent altitude of 2,000 feet on the first approach by 500 feet and 900 feet on the 
second approach when crossing the final approach fix (FAF).  The FAF is identified via a radial 
from a VOR.  During the third approach, radar data indicated that the aircraft was tracking on 
the localizer, but continued to descend to 500 feet about 1.7 nautical miles prior to the FAF.  
The radar data indicated a climb shortly after this point.  Testing of the airport approach 
equipment revealed normal equipment operation.  Testing of the aircraft's #1 ILS system found 
the glide slope to have extremely low sensitivity.  The glide slope receiver also could not pick up 
a signal.  The localizer was within tolerance, but off by a dot and a half.  The safety pilot 
reported that he never saw the airport during the third approach and thought that everything 
was ok.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to follow the published IFR procedure resulting in failure to maintain 
clearance from objects during an instrument approach.  Trees and an inoperative glide slope 
receiver were factors.

Factual Information
On March 2, 2004, at 2013 Pacific standard time, a Cessna 172N, N75844, registered to and 
flown by the pilot as a 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight, collided with a tree while on an 
Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach to runway 17 at Tacoma Narrows Airport, Gig 
Harbor, Washington.  Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no 
flight plan had been filed.   The aircraft was substantially damaged and the commercial pilot 
and pilot rated passenger were not injured.  The flight originated from Bremerton, 
Washington, at 1900.
During a telephone interview and subsequent written statement, the pilot reported that the 
purpose of the flight was to "practice (hood) night VFR ILS approaches at Tacoma Narrows 
Airport."  The pilot was accompanied by a non-instrument rated private pilot acting as a safety 
pilot.  
The pilot stated that he contacted Seattle approach and was cleared for the approaches 
followed by contact with Tacoma Tower.  Two practice ILS approaches to runway 17 had been 
accomplished, descending down to about 700 feet mean sea level before executing the missed 
approach.  After announcing the second missed approach to Tacoma tower, the tower 
controller advised to Tacoma traffic that the tower was now closed.  The pilot then contacted 
Seattle Approach for vectors to the ILS for the third approach.  
During the third approach, the pilot stated that everything was normal and the localizer and 
glide slope needles were centered when at an elevation of approximately 600 feet, the aircraft 
struck an object.  The pilot stated that he was unaware of what he hit and immediately initiated 
a climb.  The pilot then made contact with Seattle Approach to report that he was finished with 
the approaches and requested flight following back to Bremerton, where a landing was made 
without further incident.
The safety pilot reported that during the third approach, he glanced over at the instruments 
and noted that the aircraft was aligned with the runway and on the proper glide path.  He 
reported that he did not see any flags on the instrument.  He also reported that he did not note 
the altitude at the time.  During a telephone interview, the safety pilot reported that during the 
third approach, he did not at any time see the runway nor was he aware of the immediate 
terrain as it was "very dark" and the terrain was not visible.
Inspection of the aircraft revealed a leading edge indentation on the left wing just outboard of 
the lift strut attach point.  The leading edge was crushed aft to the wing spar.  Fir needles were 
embedded within the metal folds.  The rib above the lift strut attach point was deformed and 
torn.  Impact damage was also noted to the right side main landing gear leg.
A FAA flight test of the approach equipment was accomplished the following day.  The test 
revealed normal equipment operation.
A certificated airframe and powerplant mechanic tested the aircraft's #1 ILS system and found 
the glide slope to have "extremely low sensitivity."  The glide slope receiver also could not pick 
up a signal.  The localizer was within tolerance, but off by a "dot and a half."  The #2 Nav 
system localizer was tested and found to work normally and within specifications.
The Tacoma Narrows ILS Runway 17 approach plate (see attached approach plate) indicated to 
cross the SCENN Final Approach Fix (FAF)/ outer marker at 2,000 feet.  The FAF is located 
Page 4 of 7SEA04LA048
4.6 nautical miles from the missed approach point, which is .4 nautical miles from the end of 
the runway.   SCENN FAF is identified via the 227 degree radial from Seattle VOR.  The 
minimum descent altitude is 492 feet.
Radar data was provided by Seattle Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) and sent to 
the National Transportation Safety Board Research and Engineering Division for readout.   
Additionally, Seattle TRACON also provided the times in which the aircraft was cleared for the 
approach which were matched to the approximate radar data points. (See attached Radar Data 
Points)
At 1939, the flight was cleared for the ILS runway 17 approach by Seattle Approach Control and 
the pilot was instructed to maintain 2,000 feet until established (on the approach) and to 
contact Tacoma Tower.  Radar data indicated that the flight was at 2,000 feet and about nine 
nautical miles northwest of Tacoma Narrows at the time.  The aircraft tracking intercepted the 
localizer for runway 17 and began tracking inbound to the airport.  The radar data indicated 
that the aircraft crossed SCENN FAF at 1,500 feet and continued on the localizer to descend to 
500 feet within about one mile of the runway before a climb was initiated.
After the pilot announced the missed approach to Tacoma Tower, the aircraft continued a 
climbing right turn to 2,000 feet.  At 1954, the flight was cleared by Approach Control for the 
second ILS approach and the pilot was again instructed to maintain 2,000 feet until 
established and to contact Tacoma Tower.  The aircraft intercepted the localizer and began 
tracking inbound to the airport.  The aircraft crossed SCENN FAF at 1,100 feet.  The tracking 
continued on the localizer to descend to 700 feet before initiating a climb about one nautical 
mile from the end of the runway.
After the pilot announced the missed approach to Tacoma Tower at 1959, the control tower 
announced to Tacoma traffic that it was closed.
The aircraft continued a climbing right turn to 2,000 feet.  At 2009, the flight was cleared for 
the third ILS approach by Approach Control about 11 nautical miles northwest of the airport 
and the pilot was again instructed to maintain 2,000 feet until established.  Frequency change 
to UNICOM was approved.  The aircraft intercepted the localizer shortly thereafter and began 
tracking inbound to the airport and descending from 1,800 feet.  The aircraft continued on the 
localizer, descending down to 500 feet, about 7 nautical miles from the landing threshold of 
runway 17, and 1.7 nautical miles before SCENN FAF.  The radar data indicated three data 
points at 500 feet in a 10 second time frame before a climb was initiated at 2013.
The terrain elevation in the area of the collision with the tree(s) was estimated to be 
approximately 350 feet mean sea level.
The radar data provided by Seattle TRACON also noted that Minimum Safe Altitude Warning 
(MSAW) alerts were recorded during the three approaches.   During the first approach at 1943, 
and at an altitude of 1,400 feet, two brief alerts were noted, however, the altitude remained at 
1,400 feet for a brief time before resuming the descent, and no other alerts were noted for the 
remainder of the approach. 
During the second approach at 1957, and at an altitude of 1,100 feet, while on the Tacoma 
Tower frequency, MSAW alerts continued as the aircraft descended to 700 feet where the 
missed approach was initiated, followed by an increase in altitude at 1959.  Tower control 
personnel reported that the aircraft was in sight at the time of the alerts and no warnings were 
transmitted to the aircraft.

During the third approach at 2009, and at an altitude of 1,900 feet, the pilot was cleared for the 
ILS approach by Approach Control, and frequency change to UNICOM was approved.  At 2012, 
and at an altitude of 1,100 feet, MSAW alerts were recorded.  The alerts continued as the 
aircraft descended to 500 feet and ended as the aircraft transitioned to a climb to 700 feet at 
2013:37.  At 2013:51, the pilot re-established contact with Seattle Approach Control at an 
altitude of 900 feet.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
