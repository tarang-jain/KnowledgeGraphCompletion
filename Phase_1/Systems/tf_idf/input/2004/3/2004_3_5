Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot stated that an earlier flight had occurred, and that fuel had been ordered, but it was 
not delivered and placed in the airplane's fuel tanks. He further stated that the refueling error 
was not detected during the preflight inspection. He said they departed from the Fort 
Lauderdale Executive Airport, and flew to the practice area to perform aerobatics, and as he 
rolled the airplane inverted, the engine hesitated. He said he immediately recognized that the 
airplane had not been refueled after the previous flight. Rather than fly over populated areas, 
the pilot said he elected to make a precautionary landing on a dirt road close to the practice 
area, and during the rollout the airplane veered to the left, off the dirt road and nosed over into 
a water filled canal, incurring damage.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate preflight planning which resulted in an off-airport precautionary 
landing to preclude fuel exhaustion, which resulted in damage to the airplane during the 
landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
