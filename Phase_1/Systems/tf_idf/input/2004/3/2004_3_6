Analysis 
During the landing roll, the right main landing gear collapsed, and the airplane veered off to 
the right side the runway, before colliding with multiple taxiway and runway lights.  The 1,400-
hour pilot reported that while on approach, the nose wheel position indication light was not 
illuminated when the landing gear position indication lights were tested.  After conducting a 
low approach to the runway, the tower advised the pilot that all wheels appeared to be down.  
Subsequently, when the nose wheel landing gear touched down on the runway, the right main 
landing gear collapsed and the right wing struck the ground.  Inspection of the airplane 
revealed the clevis bolt was separated from the actuator rod on the right main landing gear 
assembly .
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the right main landing gear actuator clevis bolt for undetermined reasons.

Factual Information
On March 4, 2004, at 2001 central standard time, a Beech BE-200 twin-engine airplane, 
N30SE, was substantially damaged when the right main landing gear collapsed during the 
landing roll at the Springdale Municipal Airport (ASG), near Springdale, Arkansas.  The 
commercial pilot and his passenger were not injured.  The airplane was registered to and 
operated by A & M Holdings LLC, of Stuttgart, Arkansas.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 91 business flight.  The cross-country flight originated from the Stuttgart 
Municipal Airport (SGT), near Stuttgart, Arkansas, approximately 1920, destined for ASG.
The 1,400-hour pilot reported in the Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB Form 
6120.1/2) that after being cleared for the approach to runway 18 (5,302-feet wide by 75-feet 
wide asphalt runway), he extended the landing gear and checked the landing gear position 
indication lights for agreement.  However, the nose wheel position indication light was not 
illuminated.  
The pilot contacted the ASG Air Traffic Control Tower and notified the controller of the 
problem.  He performed a low approach to the runway, and the controller advised the pilot that 
all three wheels "appeared to be down."  The pilot stated that while on downwind for the 
runway, he briefed his passenger about the situation.  The pilot further stated that he used the 
emergency landing gear manual extension procedure to lower the wheels, but the nose wheel 
position indication light still did not illuminate.
During final approach, the pilot "put the airplane in a nose high attitude."  Upon landing, he 
"kept the nose wheel off as long he could."  Subsequently, when the nose wheel landing gear 
touched down on the runway, the right main landing gear collapsed and the right wing struck 
the ground.  The airplane veered off to the right side the runway, colliding with multiple 
taxiway and runway lights.
 
An examination of the airplane by an FAA certified airframe and powerplant mechanic 
revealed that the fuselage aft and below the right side co-pilot's window was damaged by 
impact with the taxiway lights.  The inspection also revealed the clevis bolt was separated from 
the actuator rod on the right main landing gear assembly .
A review of the airplane logbooks revealed the airplane completed its most recent phase three 
and phase four maintenance inspections on October 22, 2003.  The logbook entry for these 
inspections stated that the "Aviadesign hydraulic landing gear 1,000-hour or 12-month 
inspection complied with."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
