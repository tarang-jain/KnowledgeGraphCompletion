Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
California City, CA
Accident Number:
LAX04CA175
Date & Time:
04/02/2004, 1725 PST 
Registration:
N88BM
Aircraft:
Cessna 177
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
4 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The airplane collided with terrain during the takeoff initial climb.  Prior to departure, the 
certified flight instructor (CFI) noted calm wind conditions.  During the initial climb, about 50 
to 75 feet above ground level, the airplane began to descend, while rolling and yawing to the 
right.  The CFI could not maintain control of the airplane, and it continued in a 300-foot-per-
minute descent.  The airplane impacted the ground and a fire erupted.  After egressing the 
airplane, the CFI noticed a strong shift in winds into tailwind conditions.  A few minutes later, 
he noted that the winds became light again, followed by periodic gusts and wind shifts.  The 
CFI reported that the airplane had no mechanical failures or malfunctions during the flight.  
The CFI reported that the airplane's gross weight was about 2,341 pounds, and the published 
maximum gross weight is 2,350 pounds.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the certified flight instructor's failure to maintain an adequate airspeed, which resulted in a 
stall/mush condition and a collision with terrain.  Factors in the accident were strong tailwind 
conditions and a sudden wind shift.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
