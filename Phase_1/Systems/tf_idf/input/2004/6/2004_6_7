Analysis   
The pilot lost control of the tail wheel equipped airplane while on landing roll and ground 
looped the airplane.  The pilot had no prior experience in the accident airplane make and 
model, which was a single seat airplane, and was receiving guidance from another pilot via a 
handheld radio.  During the pilot's third landing, he reduced power, the airplane yawed to the 
left, and ground looped.  The pilot reported no anomalies with the airplane that would have led 
to the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during landing roll, which 
resulted in an inadvertent ground loop.  A contributing factor was the pilot's lack of experience 
in the accident airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
