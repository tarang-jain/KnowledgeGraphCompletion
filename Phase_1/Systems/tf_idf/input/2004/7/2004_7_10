Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Portland, ME
Accident Number:
IAD04LA029
Date & Time:
07/02/2004, 1936 EDT 
Registration:
N421KS
Aircraft:
Cessna 421B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
Line personnel reported to the pilot that while the airplane had been parked on the ramp, 
heavy wind and rain "hydroplaned" the airplane across the ramp about 25 feet.  After takeoff, 
the pilot retracted the landing gear and noticed an unfamiliar "clunking" noise during the 
retraction cycle.  During the approach to the destination airport, he extended the landing gear 
and noted all three of the landing gear down and locked indicator lights were green.  Sometime 
during the rollout he heard the "clunk" noise again, and the right wing began to settle lower 
than normal.  The airplane then began to veer to the right and came to rest in the grass on the 
right side of runway.  Examination of the right main landing gear revealed that two 
components of the down-lock mechanism had broken.  The parts were submitted to the Safety 
Board Materials Laboratory.  Metallurgical examination of the mating fractures revealed 
features typical of overstress separation.  The fractures contained no evidence of fatigue.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Failure of the right main landing gear down-lock mechanism resulting in the collapse of the 
right main landing gear.
Findings
Occurrence #1: GEAR COLLAPSED
Phase of Operation: LANDING - ROLL

Factual Information
On July 2, 2004, about 1936 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 421B, N421KS, was substantially 
damaged while landing at Portland International Jetport (PWM), Portland, Maine.  The 
certificated private pilot and passenger were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed, and the airplane was operating on an instrument flight rules flight plan.  The 
personal flight, which departed Groton-New London Airport (GON), Groton, Connecticut, at 
1730, was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
According to a written statement submitted by the pilot, prior to his departure from Groton, 
the airplane was involved in "thunderstorm activity" while parked on the ramp.  Line personnel 
reported to him that heavy wind and rain "hydroplaned" the airplane across the ramp about 25 
feet.  Prior to departing Groton Airport, the pilot performed a preflight examination of the 
airplane and found no abnormalities.  
After takeoff, the pilot retracted the landing gear and noticed an unfamiliar "clunking" noise 
during the retraction cycle.  The climb, cruise, and decent portions of the flight were all 
uneventful.  During the approach to Portland Jetport, he extended the landing gear and noted 
all three of the landing gear down and locked indicator lights were green.  The airplane touched 
down on the main landing gear, and as the airplane decelerated, it touched down softly on the 
nose wheel.  Sometime thereafter, the pilot heard the "clunk" noise again, and the right wing 
began to "settle down lower than normal."  The airplane then began to veer to the right side of 
the runway and came to rest in the grass on the right side of runway 29.
Examination of the right main landing gear revealed that the upper right landing gear trunnion 
ear and the attaching drag brace end ear had broken.  The parts were submitted to the Safety 
Board Materials Laboratory.  Metallurgical examination of the mating fractures revealed 
features typical of overstress separation.  The fractures contained no evidence of fatigue.
The weather reported at Groton, on the day of the accident at 1649, included winds from 190 
degrees at 7 knots gusting to 33 knots, and 3/4 statute miles visibility in heavy rain.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
