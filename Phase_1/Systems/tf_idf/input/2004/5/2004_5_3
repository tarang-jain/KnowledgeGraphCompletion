Location:
Harrisonville, MO
Accident Number:
CHI04CA113
Date & Time:
05/01/2004, 0945 CDT 
Registration:
N7448G
Aircraft:
Cessna 172K
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The airplane was substantially damaged when it departed runway 35 during landing, 
encountered a ditch adjacent to the runway and nosed over.  The certified flight instructor 
(CFI) and dual student were practicing takeoffs and landings during the local instructional 
flight.  The CFI stated that he requested the student to hold the aircraft in the landing flare 
"longer so that he could get a proper feel and visual picture."  During the flare the aircraft 
began to drift to the right.  He requested that the student correct back toward the centerline, at 
which point the student banked to the left and applied left rudder.  The CFI stated "My flight 
controls" to the student and applied right rudder.  However, the student apparently did not 
hear him because the student maintained left rudder input, overpowering the CFI.  The CFI 
recalled that the aircraft contacted the runway with the left main wheel and "veered" to the left.  
The aircraft departed the runway pavement, struck a ditch adjacent to the runway and nosed 
over.  The student stated that the CFI was "always good about saying 'My flight controls' and 
likely stated this.  However, I believe I . . . did not relinquish [the] controls to [the] instructor."  
He recalled:  "I applied rudder(s), I applied brake and I recall my hand(s) on [the] yoke 
towards impact point."  He commented that he was "much bigger" than the CFI.  The CFI 
reported that there were no failures or malfunctions associated with the aircraft prior to the 
accident.  Wind conditions recorded at the airport about ten minutes prior to the accident were 
from 350 degrees at 6 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The dual student's failure to maintain directional control of the aircraft during the landing 
flare.  Contributing factors were the dual student's failure to relinquish the controls to the flight 
instructor, the resulting inability of the flight instructor to implement any remedial action, and 
the ditch.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
