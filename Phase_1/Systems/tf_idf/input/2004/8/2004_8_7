N3838P
Aircraft:
Piper PA22-20

Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The pilot said that he was getting his tail wheel endorsement and 15 hours flight time (with an 
instructor) for aircraft insurance purposes.  He said that he had landed the airplane, and 
during the rollout, the airplane swerved.  He said that he applied the brakes too hard, and the 
airplane nosed over on the runway.  The left wing strut was bent, and the vertical stabilizer was 
bent and wrinkled.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the private pilot receiving flight training for a tail wheel endorsement to maintain 
aircraft control, and his excessive braking during the landing roll, subsequently nosing over the 
airplane.  A contributing factor was the flight instructor's inadequate supervision of the trainee.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
