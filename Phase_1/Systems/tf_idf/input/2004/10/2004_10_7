Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Robbinsville, NJ
Accident Number:
IAD05LA001
Date & Time:
10/02/2004, 1430 EDT 
Registration:
N5507V
Aircraft:
Piper PA-34-200T
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
During the takeoff roll, and at an indicated airspeed of about 70 to 75 knots, the pilot felt the 
nose of the airplane dip and then rise off the ground.  The pilot pushed the control yoke 
forward to level the airplane; it contacted the runway, and then skidded to a stop.  The landing 
gear collapsed.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the stabilator trim rod forward 
attachment hardware and the aft attachment nut were not installed.  Photographs of the 
stabilator trim tab attachment point showed that it was visible and not obscured by any 
cowlings or coverings.  The loss of the forward attachment hardware would result in an 
abnormal response, or "lightening," of the stabilator control.  About 60 flight hours and 11 
months prior to the accident, a repair station had removed, repaired, and reinstalled the 
stabilator trim tab.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The repair station's improper installation of the stabilator trim tab.  A factor was the pilot's 
inadequate preflight inspection of the airplane.

Factual Information
On October 2, 2004, at 1430 eastern daylight time, a Piper PA-34-200T, N5507V, was 
substantially damaged during the takeoff roll at Trenton-Robbinsville Airport (N87), 
Robbinsville, New Jersey.  The certificated private pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed for the local personal flight, conducted 
under 14 CFR Part 91.
In a written statement the pilot stated that during the takeoff roll, and at an indicated airspeed 
of about 70 to 75 knots, she felt the nose of the airplane dip and then rise off the ground.  She 
pushed the control yoke forward to level the airplane, it contacted the runway, and then 
skidded to a stop.
Examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed 
that the airplane's left main landing gear was sheared off at the strut, and the right main and 
nose landing gear were collapsed.  The left main landing gear axle nut was separated from the 
axle and was found on the runway with the cotter key still attached.
Further examination revealed that the stabilator trim rod forward attachment hardware was 
not installed.  The bolt and associated nut were not recovered.  The stabilator trim rod aft 
attachment bolt was in place, but the nut was not installed, nor was it recovered.
 
Examination of photographs taken by the FAA inspector of the trim rod attachment point 
revealed that the trim rod attachment point was visible on the underside of the stabilator trim 
tab, and was not obscured by any cowlings or coverings.
According to the New Piper Aircraft Customer Care Team, with the stabilator trim set at a 
neutral position and the forward stabilator trim rod attachment bolt not installed, the 
stabilator would not perform as expected by the pilot.  As airspeed increased, the lift force and 
hinge moment produced by the trim tab would result in a "lightening" of the stabilator control.  
"Normal" pilot effort would result in an unexpected over-rotation.
Examination of the airplane's maintenance log revealed that the airplane had undergone an 
annual inspection about 60 flight hours and 11 months prior to the accident.  A review of the 
repair station's work order describing the services performed to the airplane revealed that the 
stabilator trim tab had been removed, repaired, and reinstalled.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
