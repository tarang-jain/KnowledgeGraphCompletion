Analysis 
WHILE IN CRUISE AT 12,000 FEET MSL THE ENGINE LOST TOTAL POWER. THE PILOT 
MADE A FORCED LANDING ON A FIELD IN GREENVILLE, VA. THE ON SCENE 
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE FUEL INJECTOR LINE BETWEEN THE FUEL 
MANIFOLD AND THE NUMBER 6 CYLINDER FUEL NOZZLE WAS BROKEN. A 
METALLURGICAL STUDY REVEALED THAT THE SEPARATION OF THE FUEL LINE 
OCCURRED BY METAL FATIGUE. THE SAFETY BOARD RECOMMENDED TO THE FAA, 
RECOMMENDATION A-29-10, ON MARCH 2, 1992, THAT AN AIRWORTHINESS 
DIRECTIVE (A) BE PUBLISHED ADDRESSING THE FUEL LINE FAILURES. THE FAA 
ISSUED AN AD (92-12-10), ON JUNE 5, 1992, REQUIRING A VISUAL INSPECTION, 
WITHIN 10 FLIGHT HOURS, OF EACH FUEL INJECTOR FUEL LINE, AND LOOK FOR 
MISSING SUPPORT CLAMPS, OR SUPPORT CLAMPS THAT ARE NOT SECURE AND ARE 
NOT PROPERLY SUPPORTING THE FUEL LINE. THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE HAD NOT 
YET ACCRUED 10 FLIGHT HOURS SINCE THE ADOPTION OF THE AD. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE FATIGUE FAILURE OF THE FUEL INJECTOR FUEL LINE RESULTING IN ENGINE 
FAILURE.  CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE UNSUITABLE TERRAIN IN 
WHICH THE FORCED LANDING WAS MADE.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
