Analysis 
AFTER A NORMAL LANDING WAS MADE, THE PILOT STATED THAT ON TOUCHDOWN, 
THE CARBURETOR HEAT WAS TURNED OFF, THE FLAPS WERE RETRACTED, AND 
POWER WAS INCREASED FOR THE TAKEOFF. WHEN FULL POWER WAS ADDED, THE 
AIRPLANE VEERED TO THE LEFT. THE PILOT CORRECTED WITH RIGHT RUDDER 
CONTROL; HOWEVER, THE AIRPLANE CONTINUED TO THE LEFT UNTIL IT EXITED 
THE RUNWAY AND COLLIDED WITH A SNOWBANK.  THE PILOT STATED THAT HE WAS 
NOT SURE IF HE APPLIED THE BRAKE AND HE DID NOT DECREASE POWER, AS THE 
OCCURRENCE HAPPENED SO FAST. 
Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
