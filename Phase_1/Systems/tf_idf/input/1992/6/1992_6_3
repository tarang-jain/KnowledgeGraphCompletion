Analysis 
 THE AIRSHIP WAS BEING FLOWN ON A POST MAINTENANCE INSPECTION FLIGHT 
FOLLOWING AN ANNUAL INSPECTION. AFTER RELEASE FROM THE MOORING TRUCK 
THE AIRSHIP ROSE ABOUT 150 FEET THEN PITCHED OVER. FULL AFT MOVEMENT OF 
THE CONTROL YOKE FOR NOSE PITCH UP WAS INEFFECTIVE. THE AIRSHIP THEN 
COLLIDED WITH THE VEHICLE MOUNTED MOORING MAST WHICH PUNCTURED THE 
AIR BAG. EXAMINATION OF THE AIRSHIP REVEALED THAT THE ELEVATOR CONTROL 
CABLES WERE RIGGED BACKWARDS. DURING THE ANNUAL INSPECTION THE 
ELEVATOR HAD BEEN REMOVED & RE-INSTALLED. THE INSPECTOR WHO SIGNED 
OFF THE INSPECTION PAPERS DEMONSTRATED, & STATED, THAT HIS INSPECTION 
PROCEDURE WAS ACCOMPLISHED ALONE. HE PUSHED ON THE ELEVATOR WITH HIS 
HAND TO CHECK ELEVATOR DEFLECTION. HE DID NOT HAVE A SECOND PERSON 
ACTIVATE THE COCKPIT CONTROL, TO ENSURE ELEVATOR MOVEMENT IN THE 
PROPER DIRECTION, AS REQUIRED BY THE MAINTENANCE MANUAL. THE FLIGHT 
CREW PRE-UNMASTING PROCEDURE REQUIRED THAT A GROUND CREW MAN BE 
USED TO CONFIRM CORRECT CONTROL SURFACE MOVEMENT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF THE ELEVATOR CONTROL CABLES BY REPAIR 
FACILITY MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL, THE INSPECTOR'S INADEQUATE INSPECTION 
OF THE MAINTENANCE ACCOMPLISHED, AND HIS FAILURE TO FOLLOW DELINEATED 
PROCEDURES. AN ADDITIONAL CAUSE WAS THE INADEQUATE PREFLIGHT 
INSPECTION BY THE PILOT IN COMMAND, IN THAT HE FAILED TO CONFIRM 
CORRECT CONTROL SURFACE MOVEMENT AS REQUIRED BY THE PRE-UNMASTING 
CHECKLIST.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
