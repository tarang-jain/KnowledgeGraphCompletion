Analysis 
 THE NOSE LANDING GEAR COLLAPSED AFTER IT WAS LOWERED TO THE RWY 
DURING THE LANDING ROLL.  EXAM OF THE NOSE LANDING GEAR ASSY BY AN FAA 
MAINTENANCE INSPECTOR INDICATED THAT THE NOSE LANDING GEAR ACTUATOR 
WAS NOT DAMAGED. IT WAS REMOVED FOR EXAM.  DISASSEMBLY REVEALED THAT 
AN EXTRA PACKING (SIMILAR TO AN O-RING) WAS INSTALLED.  THIS ALLOWED THE 
NOSE LANDING GEAR DOWN AND LOCKED LIGHT TO ILLUMINATE BUT SHUT THE 
MOTOR OFF BEFORE THE NOSE LANDING GEAR WAS FULLY EXTENDED.  REVIEW OF 
THE AIRPLANE LOGBOOKS INDICATE THAT A PROGRESSIVE INSPECTION WAS 
SIGNED OFF TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. DURING THE INSPECTION IT WAS 
NOTED THAT THE NOSE LANDING GEAR ACTUATOR SWITCH WAS LEAKING.  THE 
CORRECTIVE ACTION INDICATES THAT THE O-RINGS WERE REPLACED.  ACCORDING 
TO THE ILLUSTRATED PARTS LIST OF THE NOSE LANDING GEAR ACTUATOR, TWO 
PACKINGS ARE INSTALLED.  ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTOR OF MAINTENANCE, THE 
MECHANIC RESPONSIBLE FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE PACKINGS WAS PROVIDED 
WITH TWO, BUT ONLY REMOVED ONE FROM THE ACTUATOR.  THIS RESULTED IN 
THE EXTRA PACKING.  THE ACFT HAD ACCUMULATED 4 HRS & 6 CYCLES SINCE THE 
INSPECTION 2 DAYS EARLIER.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
