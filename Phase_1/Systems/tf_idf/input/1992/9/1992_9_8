Analysis 
 AFTER LOWERING COLLECTIVE CONTROL TO PERFORM A SIMULATED 
AUTOROTATIVE LANDING WITH FULL THROTTLE APPLIED, THE CFI OBSERVED THAT 
THE ENG RPM DROPPED TO ZERO & THE MANIFOLD PRESSURE GAUGE INDICATED 
30 INCHES.  DURING THE EMERGENCY DESCENT AT AN ALTITUDE OF 100 FEET, HE 
OBSERVED POWER LINES AHEAD.  HE PULLED COLLECTIVE CONTROL & CLEARED 
THE LINES BUT THE HELICOPTER LANDED HARD RT SKID LOW.  THE RT SKID BROKE 
& THE HELICOPTER ROLLED ON ITS RIGHT SIDE & CAME TO REST.  THE HELICOPTER 
WAS RECOVERED & TAKEN TO THE OPERATOR'S FACILITY FOR EXAM.  THE FUEL SYS 
WAS CHECKED FOR CONTAMINANTS; NONE WERE FOUND.  FUEL QUANTITY WAS 
SUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN ENG OPERATION.  THE ENG WAS STARTED & FOUND TO 
OPERATE NORMALLY.  NO DETERMINATION COULD BE MADE AS TO THE REASON 
FOR THE REPORTED LOSS OF ENG POWER. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 IMPROPER COLLECTIVE AND CYCLIC CONTROL INPUT BY THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND 
DURING THE FORCED LANDING FOLLOWING TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DUE TO 
UNDETERMINED REASONS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
