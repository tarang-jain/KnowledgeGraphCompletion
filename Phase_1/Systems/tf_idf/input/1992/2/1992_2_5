Analysis 
 THE STUDENT PILOT WAS LANDING AT THE FIRST STOP OF A LONG CROSS-
COUNTRY. DURING THE LANDING APPROACH HER ATTENTION WAS DIVERTED BY 
ANOTHER AIRPLANE IN THE LANDING PATTERN. SHE STATED THAT SHE 
SHORTENED THE LANDING PATTERN, WAS A LITTLE FAST ON THE APPROACH, & 
USED 10 DEGREES VICE 20 DEGREES OF FLAPS. WHEN THE RWY WAS MADE, SHE 
RETARDED THE THROTTLE, & AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO FLARE FOR LANDING, THE 
AIRPLANE LANDED HARD. THE NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE IMPROPER LEVEL OFF BY THE STUDENT PILOT BECAUSE OF MISJUDGING THE 
AIRPLANE'S ALTITUDE ABOVE THE RUNWAY. A FACTOR WAS HER DIVERTED 
ATTENTION BY AN AIRCRAFT BEHIND HER IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
