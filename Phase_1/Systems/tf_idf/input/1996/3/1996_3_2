Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
     On March 1, 1996, about 1945 eastern standard time, a Cessna 172D, N2456U, registered to 
a private owner, operating as a 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight, crashed after being cleared for 
an ILS approach at the Gainesville Regional Airport, Gainesville, Florida. Instrument 
meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight plan was filed. The airplane was 
destroyed. The commercial pilot and one passenger were fatally injured. The flight originated 
from Auburn, Alabama, about 2 hours 21 minutes before the accident. The wreckage was 
located on March 2, 1996.
     Review of transcripts between Jacksonville Center, Jacksonville Flight Watch, and N2456U, 
revealed N2456U established initial radio with Jacksonville Center at 1855:40. Jacksonville 
Center advised all aircraft on their frequency at 1903:32, of hazardous weather (convective 
sigmet) that were available on the inflight advisory frequency. N2456U contacted flight watch 
at 1913:09, and requested a weather update for Orlando Executive Airport. N2456U was 
provided with the current Orlando weather observation, and was asked if he was aware of 
heavy thunderstorm activity between his position and Orlando. N2456U replied roger, and 
asked how far north of Orlando was the weather system. Flight watch stated the weather was 
25 to 30 miles northwest of Orlando and extended south of the Gainesville Airport. N2456U 
asked if there was any convective activity and was informed the tops were around 32,000 feet 
and that the weather did not appear to be circumnavigable. N2456U stated at 1915:35, "good 
copy five six uniform thanks for your help."  At 1924:48, Jacksonville Center informed N2456U 
that flight watch wanted to speak with him, and instructed him to return to his frequency when 
he was through. N2456U acknowledge the transmission, but did not contact flight watch. 
N2456U contacted Jacksonville Center at 1928:56, and requested to divert to Gainesville. The 
pilot was cleared to Gainesville, via radar vectors, and was vectored on a right downwind for 
the ILS runway 28 approach. At 1936:28, N2456U was told to expect a hard right turn, about 
180 degrees in about 3 minutes. N2456U was cleared for the approach at 1939:35, and was 
instructed to maintain 2,000 feet until established on the approach. The pilot acknowledged 
the transmission and there were no further recorded transmissions with N2456U. The airplane 
was last observed on radar at 1943:05, 3 miles east of Wynds locator outer marker.

COMMUNICATIONS
Page 3 of 7MIA96FA089
     Review of communications between N2456U and Jacksonville Center revealed Jacksonville 
Center did not provide the pilot with the Gainesville weather, nor did they assure that the pilot 
had received the Gainesville ATIS information. A single vector was issued to the pilot. 
Controllers stated they observed the airplane on radar intercept the final approach course; 
however replay of radar data did not support their observation. Additionally, the position of the 
airplane in relation to the locator outer marker was not issued to the pilot during the clearance 
for the approach. For additional information see the Air Traffic Control Group Chairman's 
Factual Report of Investigation.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
     The wreckage of N2456U was located 7.9 nautical miles east of the Gainesville Regional 
Airport, Gainesville, Florida, in the vicinity of Hawthorne, Florida.
     Examination of the crash site revealed the airplane collided with trees in a right descending 
turn on a heading of 286 degrees magnetic, separating the left and right wing tip, and the 
outboard section of the right aileron. The airplane continued forward and the right main 
landing gear touched down in an open field about 715 feet from the initial point of impact. The 
airplane collided with a 5-foot-tall, five strand barbed wire fence, and an 8-foot section of a 
telephone pole. The airplane rotated around the vertical axis to the right and slid 135 feet 
before colliding with trees aft of the right rear passenger seat. The engine assembly was lodged 
against a tree about 4 feet above the ground on a heading of about 285 magnetic. The propeller 
was attached to the propeller flange. Torsional twisting and "s" bending was present on both 
propeller blades, and both propeller blades were curled aft. The cabin roof was separated, and 
the cabin area was compressed aft to the rear passenger seat. The pilot and one passenger were 
ejected from the airplane. The nose gear, right main landing gear, left and right wing, and right 
stabliator were separated. The right fuel tank was ruptured, and fuel was present in the left fuel 
tank.
     Examination of the airframe and flight control system revealed no evidence of a precrash 
failure or malfunction. Continuity of the flight control system was confirmed for pitch, roll, and 
yaw.
     Examination of the engine assembly revealed no evidence of a precrash failure or 
malfunction. A hole was located in the top of the engine case between cylinders No. 1, 2, 3, and 
4. The oil sump had separated, and the bottom rear section of the case had fractured between 
cylinders 1 and 2. Oil was found under the engine on the ground. All engine accessories and the 
accessory case were separated from the engine. All cylinders were attached to the engine case. 
All pistons were intact and attached to their connecting rods which were bolted to the 
crankshaft. The counterweight dampeners, camshaft, lifters, and pushrods were in place, 
except for the No. 2 cylinder which sustained severe impact damage. The camshaft gear and 
larger camshaft gear were in place. Several accessory gears were displaced by impact forces. 
Both magneto drive gears were recovered separately. One was attached to an intact magneto, 
the other magneto gear was attached to a portion of a magneto. The carburetor venturi was 
intact and the carburetor was equipped with composite floats. The carburetor sump was free of 
contaminants. The top spark plugs were removed from cylinder Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The 
bottom spark plugs were removed from cylinder Nos. 2 and 6. The spark plug electrodes, 
revealed the color, wear, and deposits were normal.
     Examination of the Sigma tech vacuum pump revealed the drive was bent and would freely 
Page 4 of 7MIA96FA089
turn by hand. The rotor and vanes were not damaged.
    Examination of the electric turn coordinator, gyro horizon, and the directional gyro revealed 
no evidence of rotational scarring on the gyro, rotor, or gyro housing.
     Examination of the vertical speed indicator revealed no evidence of a precrash failure or 
malfunction. The sector gear was disengaged from the pointer gear shaft, and the diaphragm 
was not damaged.
     Examination of the pressure altimeter revealed no evidence of a precrash failure or 
malfunction. No factory seal was present. The sector pivots were broken. No tension was 
present on the hair spring to the sector and sector pointer, and the diaphragm was not 
damaged. Excessive end play was present on the top plate bridge; however no scarring was 
present on the top plate gears.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
     Post-mortem examination of the pilot was conducted by Dr. William F. Hamilton, Medical 
Examiner's Office, District 8, Gainesville, Florida, on March 3, 1996. The cause of death was 
multiple blunt traumatic injuries. Post-mortem toxicology studies of specimens from the pilot 
were performed by  Smith Kline Beechman Clinical Laboratories, Gainesville, Florida. These 
studies were negative for alcohol, neutral, acidic, and basic drugs.
TEST AND RESEARCH
     A flight check of ILS runway 28 at Gainesville Regional Airport, Gainesville, Florida, was 
requested and conducted by the FAA Atlanta  Flight Inspection Field Office on March 4,1996, 
with no deficiencies noted.
     Examination of the SILVA GPS XL1000 was conducted by SILVA PRODUCTIONS in 
Sweden on March 18, 1996. The GPS was not in the navigation mode at the time of the 
accident. The local time zone was set to UTC +6 hours instead of UTC -6 hours, therefore the 
internal UTC time was set 12 hours in advance. (For additional information see SILVA 
PRODUCTIONS AB TELEFAX analysis of SILVA GPS XL1000 Serial-No.003826.)
     Examination of the Trimble TNL 1000 was conducted by Trimble Navigation in Austin, 
Texas, on March 26, 1996. The unit turned on and functioned properly. The last known GPS 
position, velocities, and stored way points were displayed and recorded. The installed data base 
expired May 27, 1993. (For additional information see Trimble Navigation Letter dated March 
26, 1996.)
     Examination of the KX155 NAV/COM was conducted by Allied Signal Inc., Olathe, Kansas, 
on March 21, 1996. The on/off switch was found in the on position. The non-volatile memory 
chip was removed and placed in a test radio. When electrical power was applied, the 
frequencies were displayed and recorded. (For additional information see Allied Signal Inc., 
examination of a KX155 NAV/COM w G/S removed from Cessna Model 172D, Registration no. 
N2456U, which was involved in an aviation accident on March 1, 1996 near Gainesville, 
Florida.)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
