Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
NIKISKI, AK
Accident Number:
ANC96LA112
Date & Time:
08/02/1996, 2000 AKD 
Registration:
N78108
Aircraft:
Cessna 172K
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported the airplane was approximately 50 to 75 feet above the runway, just entering 
the landing flare, when the airplane suddenly dropped and landed hard.  The airplane bounced 
twice, collapsing the nose gear and the left main landing gear, and then nosed over.  The pilot 
estimated the surface wind as a quartering headwind at 10 to 15 knots. He believes that he had 
sufficient airspeed prior to the sudden sinking of the airplane, and thinks he may have 
encountered windshear. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions.  A factor was the windshear.

Factual Information
 On August 2, 1996, about 2000 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Cessna 172K airplane, 
N78108, sustained substantial damage while landing at the McGann Industrial airstrip, 
Nikiski, Alaska.  The solo private pilot was not injured. The 14 CFR Part 91 flight operated in 
visual meteorological conditions without a flight plan. The flight departed Merrill Field, 
Anchorage, Alaska, about 1900.
During a telephone conversation with the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC) on August 5, the 
pilot stated he was landing to the west with a quartering headwind estimated at 10 to 15 knots. 
He said he had the appropriate airspeed for the landing approach,  but the airplane suddenly 
dropped 50 to 75 feet and struck the runway. The airplane bounced, landed again hard, and 
nosed over. The pilot suspects that he encountered a windshear while on final approach.  He 
also stated  he believes that the nosegear collapsed during the first bounce, and on the second 
touchdown, the left main gear collapsed, which allowed the airplane to nose over.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
