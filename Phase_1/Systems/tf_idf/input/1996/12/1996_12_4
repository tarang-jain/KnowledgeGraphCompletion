Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
While in cruise flight the engine lost power, and the pilot elected to land on a road.  As the 
airplane touched down the left wing struck the brush on the side of the road, veered left, and 
turned 180 degrees opposite the direction of travel.   Witnesses reported seeing black smoke 
coming from the engine before impact.  The airplane's engine was disassembled, and the 
examination revealed that the No. 3 connecting rod cap had become detached from the 
crankshaft assembly, resulting in external damage to the engine.  In addition, the remaining 
connecting rod assemblies were found to be incorrectly installed, and the nuts were all found 
opposite end down.  The No. 2 and No. 4 assemblies were found to be loose. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
a complete loss of engine power due to a disconnected connecting rod cap.

Factual Information
 On December 1, 1996, about 1200 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-28-180, N9545J, 
registered to a private owner, operating as a Title 14 CFR Part 91, personal flight, crashed 
during a forced landing near Sugarloaf Key, Florida.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and no flight plan was filed.  The airplane was substantially damage.  The private 
pilot received serious injuries, and one passenger received minor injuries.
While in cruise flight the pilot noticed a fluctuation in engine rpm.  The engine lost 
power, and the pilot elected to land on a road.  As the airplane touched down the left wing 
struck the brush on the side of the road, veered left, and turned 180 degrees opposite the 
direction of travel.   Witnesses reported seeing black smoke coming from the engine before 
impact. 
The airplane's engine was disassembled under the supervision of the FAA, at Certified 
Engines Inc., Opa-Locka, Florida, on December 12, 1996.  The engine examination revealed 
that the No. 3 connecting rod cap had become detached from the crankshaft assembly, 
resulting in external damage to the engine.  In addition, the FAA inspector stated, the 
remaining connecting rod assemblies were found to be "incorrectly installed," and the nuts 
were "all found opposite end down."  The No. 2 and No. 4 assemblies were found to be "loose."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
