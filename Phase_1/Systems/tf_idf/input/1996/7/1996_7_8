Factual Information
 HISTORY OF THE FLIGHT
On July 1, 1996, at about 2000 eastern daylight time, a Aero Command Calair A-9B, N7730V, 
lost fuel pressure, then engine power while spraying agricultural products near Cloverdale, 
Ohio.  The pilot, the sole occupant, sustained serious injuries.  The airplane was destroyed 
during the forced landing and post-crash fire.  Visual Meteorological conditions prevailed, and 
no flight plan was filed. The local flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 137, and originated 
from Continental, Ohio, at approximately 0730.
The pilot stated that he departed Hiltner field, his home at about 0730, to spray a field of corn.  
He said that the field was in a tight river bottom and as he was about to pull up over some tall 
trees he noticed that the fuel pressure light was on.  He said that he turned on the boost pump 
and switched tanks but the engine had already quit.  He said that he made it over the trees and 
dumped the rest of his chemicals.  The aircraft crashed between two trees.  He said he 
unfastened his restraints and rolled out the right side of the aircraft and crawled away.  He said 
he sustained head injuries, and burns to his left arm, face and back.
WRECKAGE EXAMINATION/DOCUMENTATION
On July 18, 1996, the wreckage was examined by an Airworthiness Inspector from the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) and a representative from Lycoming, the engine manufacturer.  
The following is a summary of their findings:
The cockpit, left wing and the inboard portion of the right wing were destroyed by impact and 
subsequent post-crash fire.  The empennage remained intact but was impact damaged.  The 
engine remained attached to the fuselage however, most of the accessory section and fuel lines 
were destroyed by fire, including the left and right magnetos, engine driven fuel pump, and the 
fuel injector servo.  The engine crankshaft could be rotated, and all pistons and valves moved 
in sequence. There were no pre-existing mechanical failures found during the examination.  
According to the FAA inspector the aircraft had been fueled prior to the flight. 
The propeller remained attached to the engine.  One blade was bent forward at the midpoint 
and the opposite blade had an 'S type' curl at the outboard 1/3 of the blade.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
