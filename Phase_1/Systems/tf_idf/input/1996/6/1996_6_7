Registration:
N8869U
Aircraft:
Cessna 172F
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
During landing the pilot experienced a loss of control, and the airplane went off the side of the 
runway and struck a tree.  According to the pilot, 'I experienced a wind shift, from essentially, 
up the runway to a direct crosswind to the right.  This wind shift occurred during my landing 
flare, and blew me off centerline, and toward the right side of the runway.  I immediately took 
corrective action, but the inertia drove me off the edge of the runway onto the grass along side 
of (the runway).  I continued to attempt corrective action, but because the trajectory of my 
travel was about 45 degrees along the runway, but on the grass, control was difficult to return.  
The roll started to straighten out gradually, but by this time, I was along the tree line and the 
right wing tip clipped a small tree, spinning the nose of the plane into the dirt embankment, 
and trees, bringing the aircraft to a complete stop.'  The pilot reported no mechanical 
malfunctions. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to maintain directional control due to improper compensation for wind 
conditions.

Factual Information
 On June 1, 1996, about 1415 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 172F, N8869U, was substantially 
damaged when it collided with trees and terrain during landing at Blairstown Airport(1N7), 
New Jersey.  The private pilot and passenger were not injured. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed for the personal flight conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.  No flight plan 
had been filed for the flight originating in Forty Fort, Pennsylvania.
     According to the NTSB Form 6120.1/2 the pilot stated that while landing on runway 25, "I 
experienced a wind shift from, essentially, up the runway to a direct crosswind to the right. 
This wind shift occurred during my landing flare, and blew me off centerline and toward the 
right side of the runway.  I immediately took corrective action, but the inertia drove me off the 
edge of the runway onto the grass along side of runway 25.  I continued to attempt corrective 
action, but because the trajectory of my travel was about 45 degrees along the runway, but on 
the grass, control was difficult to return.  The roll started to straighten out gradually, but by 
this time, I was along the tree line and the right wing tip clipped a small tree, spinning the nose 
of the plane into the dirt embankment and trees, bringing the aircraft to a complete stop."   The 
pilot reported no mechanical malfunctions.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
