NORWOOD, MA
Accident Number:
NYC97LA010
Date & Time:
11/01/1996, 2100 EST 
Registration:
N1216T
Aircraft:
Piper PA-28R-200
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was returning to his departure airport at 2100, and flew the localizer approach to 
runway 35. The control tower was closed, and the ATIS stated that the pilot controlled lighting 
(PCL) was in operation. The pilot stated that he was not able to activate the PCL, and 
performed a go-around. During the go-around, he was able to activate the runway lights, which 
included the runway visual approach slope indicator (VASI) for runway 35. During his second 
approach, while on final, he reduced power at 100 feet and then observed a deer on the 
runway. The pilot veered the airplane left to avoid the deer, and the airplane touched down on 
the grass parallel to the runway. After a 300 foot ground roll, the airplane struck the VASI. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
failure of the pilot to perform a go-around, when an animal obstructed the runway; and his 
failure to maintain clearance from an obstruction (VASI).  Factors relating to the accident 
were: darkness, an animal (deer) on the runway, and the proximity of the obstruction.

Factual Information
 On November 1, 1996, at 2100 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-28R-200, N1216T, was 
substantially damaged when it collided with a visual approach slope indicator (VASI), while 
landing at the Norwood Memorial Airport, Norwood, Massachusetts.  The private pilot and two 
passengers were not injured.  Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal 
flight that originated at Niagara Falls, New York, at 1825.  An instrument flight plan had been 
filed for the flight conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
    The pilot rented the airplane at the Norwood Memorial Airport (OWD), and flew it to 
Niagara Falls with two passengers.  During the return flight, he flew the OWD localizer 
approach to runway 35.  The OWD control tower was closed, and the ATIS stated that the pilot 
controlled lighting (PCL) was in operation.  The pilot stated that he was not able to activate the 
PCL, and performed a go-around.  During the go-around he was able to activate the runway 
lights, which included the VASI for runway 35. 
    He further stated:
"...This ride was smooth and aligned with LOC (localizer), and VASI.  I had full flaps and 
reduced power at about 100 feet.  A few seconds later I saw an animal (I believe a deer) just on 
the runway, and abruptly turned left, but did not pull up.  By the time I leveled the wings out, I 
was hitting the VASI, and then landed on the grass..."
    The Norwood Police report stated that there were tire marks in the grass for approximately 
300 feet before the VASI lights.  It also stated that examination of the airplane revealed 
"...damage to both wings and tail.  There was also a large amount of mud on the underside of 
the plane..."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
