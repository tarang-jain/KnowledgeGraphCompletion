Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
COCHRAN, GA
Accident Number:
ATL96LA083
Date & Time:
05/01/1996, 1915 EDT 
Registration:
N1209C
Aircraft:
Piper PA-22-135
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The certified flight instructor (CFI) stated the airplane hit a bump on the takeoff roll, and 
became airborne prematurely. The airplane veered to the right at a very slow airspeed. At that 
point, the CFI elected to continue the takeoff, rather than land. He lowered the nose to gain 
airspeed; however, he was unable to attain sufficient airspeed and altitude to clear trees that 
were ahead. The airplane collided with the trees, then impacted the terrain. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
failure of the flight instructor (CFI) to maintain directional control of the airplane during 
takeoff, when the airplane encountered an uneven area on the airstrip and becoming airborne 
prematurely; and his failure to maintain clearance (or altitude) from trees, which were adjacent 
to the airstrip.  The uneven surface of the airstrip and proximity of trees were related factors.

Factual Information
 On May 1, 1996, at about 1915 eastern daylight time, a Piper PA-22-135, N1209C, 
registered to a private owner, operating as a 14 CFR Part 91 instructional flight crashed on 
initial takeoff climb in the vicinity of Cochran, Georgia. Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The commercial pilot/certified flight instructor and 
student pilot reported no injuries. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The flight 
originated from Wimberly Strip, Cochran, Georgia, about 1 minute before the accident. 
The certified flight instructor stated  the airplane hit a bump on the takeoff roll, and 
became airborne prematurely. The airplane veered to the right at a very slow airspeed. He 
lowered the nose to gain airspeed, however he did not obtain the proper climb rate. The 
airplane collided with trees and crashed into the terrain.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
