Location:
La Salle, CO
Accident Number:
CEN12LA513
Date & Time:
08/01/2012, 0920 MDT 
Registration:
N9822
Aircraft:
GRUMMAN ACFT ENG COR G-164A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot stated that shortly after takeoff for the aerial application flight, the airplane™s engine 
ﬂpopped and banged.ﬂ The pilot decided to jettison the airplane™s load and return to land at the 
departure airport. However, while returning to the airport, the engine began to surge 
repeatedly between full power and a total loss of power, and the pilot decided to land in a 
nearby alfalfa field, where the airplane nosed over during the forced landing. Examination of 
the engine revealed that a screw that secured the distributor rotor to the brass gear had come 
out, which resulted in the detached rotor moving loosely inside the magneto. Internal damage 
to the rotor and magneto was consistent with the rotor rubbing inside of the magneto. This 
distributor rotor separation and subsequent movement most likely resulted in the rough 
running engine and the subsequent loss of engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power due to the detached distributor rotor.

Factual Information
On August 1, 2012, about 0920 mountain daylight time, a Grumman Aircraft Engineering 
Corporation G-164A airplane, N9822, was substantially damaged during a forced landing to a 
field after experiencing a loss of power near La Salle, Colorado. The pilot suffered minor 
injuries. The airplane was registered to and operated by Low Level Dusting Company, Inc., 
under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137, as an agricultural application 
flight. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. At the time 
of the accident the airplane was departing from a private agricultural strip for a local flight.
The pilot stated that shortly after takeoff he heard and felt the engine ﬁpop and bang.ﬂ The pilot 
elected to return to the strip, at which time the engine experienced a complete loss of power. 
During the forced landing to a field of tall alfalfa, the ground roll was faster than desired and 
the airplane was approaching a ditch and obstacles at the end of the field. The pilot applied 
heavy braking and the airplane stopped abruptly and nosed over, coming to rest inverted. The 
outboard portion of the upper left wing separated, the engine separated from the airframe, and 
the vertical stabilizer was crushed. 
An examination of the engine revealed that a screw securing the distributor rotor to the brass 
gear had come out. The rotor had separated and was loose inside of the magneto. Internal 
damage to the rotor and magneto was consistent with the rotor rubbing inside of the magneto. 
Further examination of the engine and airframe revealed no anomalies.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
