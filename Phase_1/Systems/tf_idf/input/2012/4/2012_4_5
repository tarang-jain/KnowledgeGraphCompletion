Analysis   
On the day before the accident, the pilot installed dry fertilizer equipment on the airplane. 
Later that afternoon, the pilot removed the dry fertilizer equipment and installed spray booms 
and a spray pump in preparation for dispensing a liquid chemical the next day. The following 
day, during the takeoff roll, chemicals started covering the windshield, and the windshield 
washer had no effect. The pilot lost all outside visual references and was unable to maintain 
level flight. The airplane impacted the ground and slid to a stop. Postaccident examination 
revealed that the hopper vent had not been turned around. The hopper was still pressurized 
and chemicals blew out of the hopper lid onto the windshield.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The improper positioning of the hopper vent, which allowed chemicals to escape and cover the 
airplane's windshield.
Findings
Aircraft
Windows-windshield system - Damaged/degraded
Personnel issues
Incorrect action selection - Pilot (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
