Location:
Philadelphia, PA
Accident Number:
ERA12CA266
Date & Time:
04/02/2012, 1226 EDT 
Registration:
N6902L
Aircraft:
PIPER PA-60-602P
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot was cleared to land on runway 26. The recorded surface wind at the airport around 
the time of the accident was from 330 to 340 degrees at 14 to 18 knots, gusting to 25 knots; a 
peak wind gust from 350 degrees at 26 knots was recorded about 7 minutes after the accident. 
The pilot said that he landed on the left main gear with the right main intermittently touching 
the ground and tried to lower the right wing to improve wheel-to-runway contact but was 
unsuccessful because of a wind gust. The airplane swerved off the left side of the runway onto 
the soft grass area, where the airplane™s main landing gear collapsed, and both wings were 
substantially damaged. The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures 
that would have precluded normal operations.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control while landing in gusting crosswind 
conditions.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
