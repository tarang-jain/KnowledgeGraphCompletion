Analysis   
According to the pilot, as the airplane approached the runway, he realized that the airplane™s 
descent rate was higher than normal. The airplane touched down hard, bounced, and began to 
porpoise. The pilot attempted to abort the landing, but the airplane yawed left, its nose hit the 
ground, and it nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and the 
vertical stabilizer. The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or 
failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal flight.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
