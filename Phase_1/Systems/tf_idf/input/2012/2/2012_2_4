Aircraft:
BELLANCA 17-30
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The pilot reported that after touchdown, the airplane suddenly veered off the left side of the 
runway. During the runway excursion, the airplane struck the precision approach path 
indicator light system, resulting in substantial damage to both wings. Postaccident 
examination of the airplane revealed that a rod end bearing on the nosewheel steering pushrod 
failed. As a result, the pilot was unable to operate the nosewheel steering.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the nosewheel steering pushrod, which resulted in a loss of airplane directional 
control and runway excursion.
Findings

Factual Information
On February 2, 2012, about 1310 central standard time, a Bellanca model 17-30 airplane, 
N6564V, veered off of the left side of the runway while landing at the Charles B. Wheeler 
Downtown Airport (MKC), Kansas City, Missouri. During the runway excursion, the airplane 
struck the precision approach path indicator (PAPI) light system resulting in damage to both 
wings. The private pilot and flight instructor were not injured. The airplane sustained 
substantial damage to the fuselage and right wing. The aircraft was registered to and operated 
by the private pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as an 
personal flight. The pilot was receiving flight instruction at the time the accident occurred. 
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was not operating on a flight 
plan. The local flight originated about 1145.
The pilot reported that after the previous takeoff, the red in-transit landing gear indicator light 
remained illuminated. He said that he cycled the landing gear and the light went out. The pilot 
reported that when he lowered the gear for landing at MKC, only two of the three green gear-
down indicator lights illuminated. The landing approach was aborted and the pilot cycled the 
landing gear three times. At that point, all three green gear-down indicator lights illuminated. 
The pilot reported that the subsequent landing was normal, but as soon as the nose wheel 
touched down the airplane veered sharply to the left and off the runway. 
A postaccident examination revealed a fractured spherical rod end for the nosewheel steering 
pushrod. The rod end was fractured in the threaded portion of the shank. The threaded portion 
of the rod end, along with the jam nut remained attached to the steering pushrod.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
