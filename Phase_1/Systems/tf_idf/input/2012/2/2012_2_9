Analysis   
The pilot was conducting a series of practice accuracy landings in preparation for a checkride. 
He reported that he inadvertently forgot to extend the landing gear. He added that he did not 
remember hearing the landing gear warning horn just before touchdown because he had 
allowed himself to become fixated on maneuvering the aircraft to the precise landing point. 
The airplane touched down on the runway surface with the landing gear retracted, which 
caused substantial damage to the fuselage structure. The pilot reported that there were no 
preimpact mechanical malfunctions with the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
