Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that, during the landing flare, he noticed a deer (or possibly several deer) 
move onto the runway. In response, he added power and attempted to maneuver away from 
the animal(s). The airplane impacted what he believed to be a deer. The pilot realized that the 
airplane had likely incurred damage that could hinder further flight, so he retarded the engine 
power and landed without further incident. The left wing sustained substantial damage to the 
leading edge. The pilot reported no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation. The Federal Aviation Administration Airport 
Facilities Directory for the airport contained a note stating that there are deer occasionally on 
the runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
