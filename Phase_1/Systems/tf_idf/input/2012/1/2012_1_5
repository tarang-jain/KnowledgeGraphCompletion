Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot stated that the flight was conducted in visual flight rule conditions, and when he 
arrived at the destination airport he noted no airplanes in the area. He said that he heard no 
radio communications to indicate the appropriate landing direction, saw no signs of wind 
direction as he approached the airport, and the airport™s wind sock did not indicate a wind or 
direction. The pilot elected to land on runway 16. When the airplane touched down, an 
unexpected wind gust pushed the airplane right of the runway center line. The pilot tried to 
straighten the airplane; however, the left wing tip and the left horizontal stabilizer tip 
contacted the ground, sustaining substantial damage. The pilot stated that there were no 
preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operations.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s failure to maintain directional control after encountering a wind gust during 
landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
