8KCAB

Substantial
Defining Event:

Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
According to the pilot, the touchdown was on-speed, and she made a three-point landing. 
During the landing roll, the airplane seemed to weathervane to the right side of the runway, so 
the pilot applied left rudder. The airplane veered to the left and departed the paved runway at a 
slow speed. As the airplane exited the runway, the right main landing gear collapsed, which 
resulted in the right wing contacting the ground, which resulted in substantial damage to the 
wing structure. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during the landing.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
