Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Business
Analysis   
The pilot reported that he flew a visual approach and landed near the midpoint of a 2,691-foot-
long runway. The wind was at 5 knots and aligned with the runway, which was dry. After 
landing, the pilot applied ﬁlight/normal brakingﬂ but noticed his deceleration rate was 
inadequate to stop on the remaining runway. The pilot subsequently applied heavier braking, 
but the brakes ﬁseemed to have no effect.ﬂ Realizing he was not going to stop the airplane on 
the remaining runway, the pilot attempted a go-around near the departure end of the runway. 
The airplane never became airborne, departed the runway, and impacted an airport perimeter 
fence. Substantial damage to the airplane included impact damage to both wings and ailerons. 
Skid marks from the accident airplane were documented near the departure end of the runway. 
A postaccident examination of the braking system of the airplane revealed no mechanical 
malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s inadequate braking action and decision to abort the landing near the departure end 
of the runway. Contributing to the accident was the pilot™s attempt to land near the midpoint of 
the runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
