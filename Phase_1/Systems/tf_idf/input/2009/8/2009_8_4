Analysis   
The student pilot encountered a thermal lift, and climbed to 3,000 feet. He stated in a 
statement to law enforcement personnel, "I got myself into a spin that I was not sure how to get 
out of." He further stated, "Somehow I was able to get myself out of that, and was headed back 
to the airport. This is where it gets vague to me. I think I started into another spin." Another 
glider pilot who departed 10 to 15 minutes before the student pilot stated he observed the 
glider about a 1,000 feet or less below him spinning to the left. He made a 360 degree turn 
looking for the glider and could not see it and figured the pilot recovered from the spin and 
flew away. Examination of the glider by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed 
the glider collided with the ground in a nose down left wing attitude. The forward cabin area 
received structural damage, the left wing was pushed aft and the right wing was accelerated 
forward. The flaps on both wings were extended. The Pilot's Notes for the L-13 Sailplane states, 
the glider will stall at 30 knots with the flaps extended. No anomalies were noted with the 
airframe or flight controls.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=74423
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
