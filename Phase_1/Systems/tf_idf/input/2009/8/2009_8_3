Factual Information
On August 1, 2009, about 1857 central daylight time, an experimental amateur-built Stirling 
Starduster biplane, N1XY, sustained substantial damage when it impacted a field following low 
level maneuvers near Earlham, Iowa. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of 
the accident. The 14 CFR Part 91 flight was not operating on a flight plan. The private pilot 
received serious injuries. The local personal flight originated at time unknown.
According to a Dallas County Sheriff™s incident report, a witness observed the airplane perform 
a roll and then attempted to perform a loop. The report indicated that as ﬁthe plane was 
coming out of the loop, it did not have enough altitude and that is when it struck the ground.ﬂ
The pilot held a private pilot certificate. His last application for a medical certificate was on 
October 31, 2005, and on that application he indicated that he had accumulated 900 hours of 
total flight time.
N1XY was an experimental amateur-built Stirling Starduster single-engine, propeller-driven, 
fixed tailwheel, two-seat, biplane. According to registration and airworthiness records, the 
biplane was powered by a 180-horsepower Lycoming O-360-A4A engine, serial number L-
26691-36A and it drove a Sensenich 78 EM8 fixed pitch propeller.
Examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed no 
mechanical anomalies.
The pilot was sent an accident report form and a completed one has not been received by the 
NTSB.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
