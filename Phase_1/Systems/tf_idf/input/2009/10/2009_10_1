Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Dayton, OH
Accident Number:
CEN10LA001
Date & Time:
10/01/2009, 0930 EDT 
Registration:
N3635N
Aircraft:
DUSENBERRY MARK J 1905 WRIGHT 
FLYER
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane, which was built by the pilot, was a replica of the Wright Brothers 1905 airplane. 
The purpose of the flight was to practice in preparation for the 104th Anniversary of Practical 
Flight celebration. The accident occurred on the second flight of the day. After takeoff, the 
airplane climbed to an altitude of 15 to 20 feet, then entered a shallow descending right bank. 
The wings of the airplane leveled and the nose pitched up. The nose of the airplane then 
dropped and the airplane impacted the terrain. The airplane received substantial damage to 
the fuselage, wings, and elevator. A 4-knot tailwind prevailed at the time of the accident. 
Postaccident inspection of the airplane failed to reveal any preimpact failures or malfunctions.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during the flight, which resulted in an 
aerodynamic stall.
Findings
Aircraft
Performance/control parameters - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Tailwind - Not specified

Factual Information
On October 1, 2009, at 0930 eastern daylight time, an amateur built experimental Dusenberry 
1905 Wright Flyer, N3635N, collided with the terrain following a loss of control shortly after 
taking off from the Huffman Prairie Flying Field at the Wright-Patterson AFB (FFO), Dayton, 
Ohio.  The pilot received serious injuries.  The airplane received substantial damage to the 
fuselage, wings, and elevator.  The local flight was being operated under Title 14 Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 91.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was 
filed.  The flight originated just prior to the accident.
The accident occurred on the second flight of the day.  A series of photos were submitted 
documenting both flights.  On the accident flight, the photos show the airplane prior to takeoff 
up to and including the accident.  After takeoff, the airplane climbed to an altitude of 15 to 20 
feet.  The airplane then entered a shallow descending right bank.  The wings of the airplane 
leveled and the nose pitched up.  The nose of the airplane then dropped and the airplane 
impacted the terrain.  
The airplane, which was built by the pilot, was a replica of the Wright Brothers 1905 airplane.  
The purpose of the flight was to practice in preparation for the 104th Anniversary of Practical 
Flight celebration.  
The pilot's logbook shows that he flew a total of 39 flights in the airplane.  These flights totaled 
approximately 27 minutes of flight time.
A 4 knot tailwind prevailed at the time of the accident. A post accident inspection of the 
airplane failed to reveal any pre-impact failures/malfunctions.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
