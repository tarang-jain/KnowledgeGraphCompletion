Analysis   
The private pilot reported that before landing on the frozen snow-covered lake in a ski-
equipped airplane, he intended to do a touch-and-go landing to check the snow conditions. He 
said that variable and gusty north-northwesterly winds required him to depart into an area of 
rising, tree-covered terrain. After landing to the northwest, he added full engine power and the 
airplane became airborne, but would not climb fast enough to outclimb the rising terrain. In 
the pilot's written statement to the NTSB, he stated that he: "Failed to fully recognize situation 
in time to abort departure..."  The pilot indicated that the airplane collided with tree-covered 
terrain at the departure end of the lake. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the 
wings, fuselage, and empennage. The pilot indicated that there were no preaccident mechanical 
problems with the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
