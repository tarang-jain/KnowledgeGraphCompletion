Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot of the Robinson R-22 stated that he was preparing for takeoff in the center of a non-
movement area. Upon advancing the throttle to 100%, the helicopter began to spin rapidly to 
the left while still on the ground. The pilot attempted to completely lower the collective lever 
while reducing throttle to stop the rotation, but felt no noticeable effect. He then pulled the 
mixture control knob to stop the engine, coming to rest at the edge of a non-movement area. As 
the helicopter spun, it drifted until the tailboom contacted a snow bank incurring substantial 
damage. The pilot stated that he was wearing a heavy coat and boots at the time of the 
accident, which may have interfered with his ability to operate the collective and anti-torque 
pedal controls.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain control of the helicopter during takeoff. Contributing to this 
accident was the interference of the flight controls by the heavy coat and boots the pilot was 
wearing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
