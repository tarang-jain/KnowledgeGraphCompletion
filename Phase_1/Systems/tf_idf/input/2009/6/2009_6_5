Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
St. Louis, MO
Accident Number:
CEN09LA335
Date & Time:
06/02/2009, 1820 CDT 
Registration:
N76456
Aircraft:
CESSNA 140
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Sys/Comp malf/fail (non-power)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The accident occurred during the second flight since the airplane had undergone maintenance 
on the left flap assembly. The pilot reported hearing a loud bang shortly after liftoff, which was 
followed by repeated banging from behind his position. He performed an immediate landing, 
touching down with about 50 feet of runway remaining. The airplane overran the end of the 
runway and nosed over in a wheat field. A post-accident inspection revealed that the upper half 
of the left inboard wing fairing was bent upward and aft. The one-piece fairing was properly 
secured to the lower wing structure, but none of the five upper screws were located. The fairing 
upper screw holes did not exhibit any damage. This lack of damage was not consistent with a 
progressive loss of the upper screws during flight. The fairing had been removed during the 
recent flap maintenance.  According to the mechanic who performed the maintenance, the 
fairing was reinstalled in the presence of several individuals, including the pilot, and that all of 
the screws were installed before he returned the airplane to service. According to the pilot, 
during his preflight inspection he visually confirmed that the screws were installed, although 
he did not verify their security.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The improper installation of the wing fairing during recent maintenance, which resulted in the 
partial separation of the fairing shortly after takeoff.
Findings
Aircraft
Aerodynamic fairings structure - Incorrect service/maintenance (Cause)
Personnel issues
Installation - Maintenance personnel (Cause)
Environmental issues
Rough terrain - Contributed to outcome

Factual Information
On June 2, 2009, about 1820 central daylight time, a Cessna 140, N76456, owned and piloted 
by a private pilot was substantially damaged when it nosed over during an aborted takeoff at 
the Creve Coeur Airport (1H0), near St. Louis, Missouri.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed at the time of the accident.  The personal flight was operating under the provisions of 
14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 without a flight plan.  The pilot was not injured.  The 
local area flight departed about 5 minutes before the accident.
The accident occurred during the second flight since the airplane had undergone maintenance 
on the left flap assembly.  The first flight was performed within an hour of the accident and 
consisted of four landings at 1H0.  The airplane was refueled between the two flights.
The pilot stated that he departed on runway 16 and entered a right traffic pattern for runway 25 
(3,120 feet by 220 feet, grass) to perform two additional landings.  The first landing was 
uneventful and he back-taxied to the approach end of runway 25 before initiating his second 
takeoff.  He reported hearing a loud bang shortly after liftoff, about 30 feet above the runway, 
which was followed by repeated banging from behind his position.  He performed an 
immediate landing, touching down with about 50 feet of runway remaining.  The airplane 
overran the end of the runway, crossed over a taxiway and runway 16, before entering a wheat 
field.  The airplane nosed over as it decelerated in the wheat crop, substantially damaging the 
vertical stabilizer, rudder, and aft fuselage.  The propeller, spinner, engine mounts, both flaps, 
and the right aileron were also damaged.
Examination of the wreckage revealed that the upper half of the left inboard wing fairing was 
bent upward and aft.  The one-piece aluminum fairing forms the trailing edge and is located 
between the inboard edge of the flap and the fuselage.  The fairing is secured to the upper and 
lower wing structure with screws.  The fairing remained attached to the lower wing structure by 
its corresponding screws.  None of the five upper screws were located.  The upper screw holes 
on the fairing sheet metal and their corresponding holes and nut-plates on the wing structure 
did not exhibit any damage.
The fairing had been removed during the recent flap maintenance.  According to the mechanic 
who performed the maintenance, the fairing was reinstalled in the presence of several 
individuals, including the pilot, and that all of the screws were installed before he returned the 
airplane to service.  According to the pilot, during his preflight inspection he visually confirmed 
that the screws were installed, although he did not verify their security.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
