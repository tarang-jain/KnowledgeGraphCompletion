Location:
Coldwater, MI
Accident Number:
CEN10LA037
Date & Time:
11/02/2009, 1403 EST 
Registration:
N8364W
Aircraft:
PIPER PA-28-180
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that he was in cruise flight at 2,500 feet above mean sea level when the 
engine oil temperatures started to rise. He started to divert to a nearby airport, but the engine 
seized and he executed a forced landing to a field. The inspection of the engine revealed a hole 
in the crankcase at the #4 cylinder position. The #4 piston connecting rod was found 
disconnected from the crankshaft, and it was deformed and bent into a ﬁUﬂ shape. The #4 
connecting rod cap was separated from the #4 connecting rod. One of the connecting rod bolts 
was found sheared in half with the nut still attached to one end of the bolt. The other 
connecting rod bolt was not located in the connecting rod or in the rod cap. A connecting rod 
bolt was found in the bottom of the engine. The bolt threads exhibited some impact damage, 
but otherwise, the connecting rod bolt was intact and was not bent. The nut for the connecting 
rod bolt was not located in the engine. The engine logbook indicated that four new pistons were 
installed on May 31, 2003. The logbook entry did not indicate that the connecting rods had 
been replaced. On May 1, 2007, the #4 cylinder was replaced, but there was no indication in 
the logbook entry that the #4 piston or connecting rod had been repaired or replaced.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power due to the separation of the No. 4 piston connecting rod as a result of 
inadequate torque of the connecting rod bolt.

Factual Information
On November 2, 2009, at 1403 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-28-180, N8364W, sustained 
substantial damage during a forced landing to a field about 2 miles southeast of the Branch 
County Memorial Airport (EOB), Coldwater, Michigan. The airplane experienced a total loss of 
engine power when the engine seized during cruise flight at 2,500 feet above mean sea level 
(msl). The pilot, the sole occupant, received minor injuries. The 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 91 flight departed Pontiac, Michigan, about 1300 and was en route to Champaign, Illinois.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan was filed. 
The pilot reported that while he was in cruise flight the oil temperature started rising so he 
decided to land at EOB.  When he was about five miles from the airport, the engine started 
making noise and then the propeller ﬁfroze.ﬂ  He executed a forced landing to a field and the 
airplane sustained substantial damage.
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness inspector examined the airplane. The 
engine was a 180 horsepower Lycoming O-360-A3A.  A hole was observed on the top of the 
engine crankcase at the #4 cylinder position. The #4 cylinder was removed. The #4 piston 
connecting rod was found disconnected from the crankshaft, and it was deformed and bent 
into a ﬁUﬂ shape. The #4 connecting rod cap was separated from the #4 connecting rod. One of 
the connecting bolts was found sheared in half with the nut still attached to one end of the bolt. 
The other connecting rod bolt was not located in the connecting rod or in the rod cap. A 
connecting rod bolt was found in the bottom of the engine. The bolt threads exhibited some 
impact damage, but otherwise, the connecting rod bolt was intact and was not bent. The nut for 
the connecting rod bolt was not located in the engine.  The connecting rod bolts for the #3 
connecting rod and rod cap were found sheared in half, but the nuts were still attached to the 
connecting rod bolts.
 
The engine logbook indicated that four new pistons were installed on May 31, 2003. The 
logbook entry did not indicate that the connecting rods had been replaced. On May 1, 2007, the 
#4 cylinder was replaced, but there was no indication in the logbook entry that the #4 piston or 
connecting rod had been repaired or replaced. On September 12, 2007, the #3 cylinder was 
replaced, but there was no indication in the logbook entry that the #3 piston or connecting rod 
had been repaired or replaced.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
