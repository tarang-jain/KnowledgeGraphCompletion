Location:
Grangeville, ID

WPR10CA049
Date & Time:
11/01/2009, 0715 PST 
Registration:
N82213
Aircraft:
PIPER PA-18-150
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Collision with terr/obj (non-CFIT)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot, who was making a visual-flight-rules approach to an 800-foot-long remote airstrip, 
overflew the runway to observe the windsock. Because he observed the windsock hanging limp, 
he assumed that the winds around the runway were calm, and therefore continued his 
approach. About the time he reached the approach end of the uphill-sloping runway, the 
airplane encountered a strong tailwind gust, which pushed it "–too far up the strip to land." 
The pilot therefore executed a go-around, but his decision was "too late" and he was therefore 
unable to outclimb the terrain on the departure end of the runway. During the go-around 
sequence, the airplane's landing gear came in contact with brush and it flipped over onto its 
back. Ground witnesses told the pilot that all morning the winds had been variable in direction 
and had been changing rapidly from nearly calm to gusting as high as 20 miles per hour.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's delayed decision to execute a go-around in gusting winds and with up-sloping 
terrain.
Findings
Personnel issues
Decision making/judgment - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Sloped/uneven terrain - Contributed to outcome
Tailwind - Effect on operation
Gusts - Effect on operation

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
