Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Yancey, TX
Accident Number:
CEN11LA318
Date & Time:
05/03/2011, 1115 CDT 
Registration:
N927SH
Aircraft:
ROBINSON HELICOPTER R22 BETA
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel related
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Aerial Observation
Analysis 
While maneuvering at a low altitude, the pilot heard the engine noise change and the low rpm 
warning horn sound. The helicopter settled to the ground and rolled onto its right side. While 
exiting the helicopter the pilot noted that the fuel shutoff valve had been moved 3/4 of the way 
towards the closed position. The pilot concluded that either the passenger's clothing or seat 
belt had inadvertently closed the fuel valve when the passenger had moved near the valve 
which resulted in the loss of engine power. Due to the low altitude, the pilot was unable to 
perform an autorotation in time. A postaccident examination of the helicopter did not reveal 
any preimpact anomalies. The helicopter was equipped with an older style fuel shutoff valve 
that had a handle that could be easily moved; however, a newer spring-loaded fuel shutoff 
valve was available that would have prevented inadvertent valve actuation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power due to the unintentional closure of the fuel shutoff valve.
Findings

Fuel selector/shutoff valve - Unintentional use/operation (Cause)

Factual Information
On May 3, 2011, 1115 central daylight time, a Robinson Helicopter R22 Beta, N927SH, collided 
with terrain following low rotor rpm near Yancey, Texas. Substantial damage was sustained to 
the fuselage and tail boom sections. The commercial pilot and passenger were not injured. The 
helicopter was registered to Prentice Aviation Inc, Bokchito, Oklahoma, and operated by a 
private individual under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as an aerial 
observation flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated 
without a flight plan. The flight originated from a private area approximately 1045.
According to a statement provided by the pilot, he was flying an animal control flight over 
private property. While searching for feral pigs, the pilot was flying 4 to 5 feet above ground 
level when his passenger notified the pilot of a pig's location. While maneuvering, the pilot 
heard the engine noise change and the low rpm warning horn sound as the engine began to 
shut down. The helicopter settled to the ground and rolled onto its right side. While egressing 
the helicopter, the pilot noticed fuel leaking from the top of the helicopter's fuel tank. While 
securing the fuel shutoff valve, the pilot noticed that the valve handle was 3/4 the way towards 
the closed position. The pilot concluded that either the passenger's clothing or seat belt had 
inadvertently closed the fuel valve which resulted in the loss of engine power when the 
passenger had moved near the valve. There were no other reported malfunctions or failures 
with the helicopter. An examination of the helicopter conducted by a Federal Aviation 
Administration inspector did not reveal any preimpact anomalies.
The helicopter was equipped with an older style fuel shutoff valve that consisted of a handle 
(part number A670-2). A newer fuel shutoff valve was available to be installed (part number 
A670-1). The newer fuel shutoff valve was remodeled to be spring-loaded towards the open 
position to prevent inadvertent valve actuation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
