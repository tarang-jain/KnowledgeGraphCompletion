Registration:
N876KF
Aircraft:

Aircraft Damage:
Substantial

1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot was landing his single-engine experimental airplane in calm wind conditions, when 
the left main gear collapsed upon touchdown. The airplane veered to the right and the pilot 
attempted to keep the airplane on the runway by applying engine power and right aileron; 
however, the airplane exited the runway and spun, which resulted in structural damage to the 
fuselage. A postaccident examination of the left main landing gear strut revealed that the strut 
failed due to a pre-existing crack in the weld joint. The crack would not have been readily 
visible to the pilot during a pre-flight inspection due to the construction of the strut. The 
bracing around the strut exhibited signs of distress with twisted and shiny fracture surfaces. No 
other anomalies were found with the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Failure of the left main landing gear strut due to a pre-existing crack in the weld joint.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
