Factual Information
On January 2, 2011, approximately 0900 central standard time, an American Legend Aircraft 
AL3, N102PJ, impacted an construction sign and nosed over following a runway excursion at 
the Aero Country Airport (T31), McKinney, Texas. The student pilot was not injured. The 
airplane sustained substantial crushing damage to the right wing and vertical stabilizer. The 
aircraft was registered to and operated by Shell Air LLC, Olathe, Kansas, under the provisions 
of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a local training flight. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated without a flight plan. The local flight 
originated from T31 approximately 0855.
According to a statement provided by the pilot, upon landing at the airport, the airplane 
bounced several times before he lost control of the airplane. The airplane veered to the right 
and departed the runway. After departing the runway the airplane's right wing struck a 
construction sign. The airplane then impacted a ditch and came to rest inverted. The pilot did 
not report any anomalies with the airplane prior to the accident landing. A certified flight 
instructor saw the landing and reported that the airplane's tailwheel did not appear to fully 
contact the ground prior to the airplane departing the runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
