Analysis   
The student pilot stated that he was conducting a solo cross-country flight in the tailwheel-
equipped airplane. He landed uneventfully at the destination airport, which was equipped with 
a turf runway, and to which he had flown with his instructor the previous day. After landing, 
the student pilot taxied the airplane back to the end of the runway to take off. He stated that he 
applied power to begin the takeoff roll, and the airplane lifted off the ground around 50 miles 
per hour. The student pilot lowered the airplane's nose to gain airspeed, and the airplane 
contacted the runway before impacting trees on the right side of the runway. A postaccident 
examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the wing spar, and no mechanical 
malfunctions or anomalies were noted.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
