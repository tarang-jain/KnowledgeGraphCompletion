Analysis   
The student pilot stated that she was completing her first solo cross-country flight. She landed 
the airplane on its main landing gear but it bounced. She then decreased the pitch of the 
airplane's nose, resulting in the nosewheel touching down independently of the main landing 
gear. The airplane's nosewheel strut broke loose from its attachments and was driven into the 
engine compartment, which resulted in substantial damage to the firewall. She was able to 
keep the airplane on the runway during the entire landing sequence and roll. She taxied the 
airplane off of the runway and did not report any mechanical anomalies with the aircraft. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper recovery from a bounced landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
