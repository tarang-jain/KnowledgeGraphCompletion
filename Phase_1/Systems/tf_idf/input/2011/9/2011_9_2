Analysis   
While returning to the airport after completing an aerial application, the pilot noticed a 
reduction in engine RPM and a rise in oil temperature. The pilot was unable to maintain 
altitude and he elected to execute a forced landing to a road. During the forced landing, the left 
wing contacted a tree and pivoted the airplane into trees. Postaccident examination of the 
airplane showed both wing spars and the right elevator were bent. Based on his observations 
during the engine failure and his past engine failure experience, the pilot suspected the main 
bearing failed within the engine. The engine was not disassembled for further examination and 
the cause of the engine failure was not determined.

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=81762
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
