Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Pompano Beach, FL
Accident Number:
ERA12LA058
Date & Time:
11/01/2011, 1735 EDT 
Registration:
N739JN
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172N
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
According to the pilot, while the airplane was descending on final approach, the throttle 
control became unresponsive. Although multiple settings were attempted, the engine remained 
at idle rpm, and the pilot made a forced landing on a road. The airplane collided with a 
lightpost and sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. Although initial examination of the 
engine did not reveal any preimpact mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation, further examination revealed that the throttle cable had separated from its 
housing/end fitting. As a result, the throttle cable could not actuate the carburetor control, and 
the engine remained at idle rpm. A review of the airframe and engine logbooks revealed that 
the throttle cable was not maintained correctly and was never maintained in accordance with 
the manufacturer™s service manual.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The separation of the throttle cable from its fitting, which resulted in an inability to control 
engine power. Contributing to the accident was the inadequate maintenance by the owner.
Findings
Aircraft
Fuel control/carburetor - Malfunction (Cause)
Personnel issues
Scheduled/routine maintenance - Owner/builder (Factor)

Factual Information
On November 1, 2011, at 1735 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 172N, N739JN, was substantially 
damaged during a forced landing following a partial loss of engine power while on final 
approach to Pompano Beach Airpark (PMP), Pompano Beach, Florida. The certificated 
commercial pilot and one passenger reported minor injuries. The personal flight was operating 
under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The flight originated from Fort Lauderdale 
Executive Airport (FXE), Fort Lauderdale, Florida, at 1730.
The pilot stated that he was descending on final approach to land, when the throttle control 
became unresponsive. He made attempts to change the engine power setting, but no change in 
power occurred. The engine remained at idle speed as the airplane continued to descend. He 
made a forced landing on a road and the airplane collided with a light post.
Post accident examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Inspector revealed that the 
fuselage collided with a light post and broke away from the cabin section. The left wing 
outboard section was broken away from the wing assembly at the wing strut. The wreckage was 
recovered and a cursory examination was conducted on the engine. No engine specific 
mechanical anomalies were discovered that would have precluded normal engine operation. 
Further examination revealed that the outer throttle cable housing was separated. When the 
throttle control was moved, it did not actuate the carburetor throttle control. A review of the 
maintenance records did not reveal any recent maintenance to the cable and during the last 
annual inspection no anomalies were noted.
A review of the aircraft and engine logbooks revealed that the throttle cable was not replaced or 
inspected within the last 2512.9 hours. A review of the Cessna model 172 service manual states, 
on page 2-42, item J: ﬁEngine controls and linkage-check general condition, freedom of 
movement through full range. Check for proper travel, security of attachment, and evidence of 
wear. Check friction locks for proper operation (every 50 hours).ﬂ Page 2-48 of the manual, 
special inspections legends, part E; states, ﬁLubricate each 50 hours, these controls are not 
repairable and should be replaced every 1,500 hours or whenever maximum linear movement 
exceeds .050 inches.ﬂ

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
