Registration:
N23249

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot-in-command (PIC) of the tailwheel airplane stated that he was flying from his private 
airstrip, with a friend who was also a pilot. The friend did not have much experience in 
tailwheel airplanes and had not flown the airplane from the airstrip. The PIC completed two 
takeoffs and landings uneventfully, and then let his friend perform the third takeoff. During the 
takeoff roll, as the tailwheel lifted, the airplane yawed to the left. The PIC then took authority of 
the controls and attempted to correct the yaw. The airplane traveled off the left side of the 
runway and impacted trees, resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage and left wing. The 
PIC reported no preimpact mechanical anomalies with the airplane and added that the wind 
was light and variable at the time. The PIC stated that he should have taken control of the 
airplane sooner.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot-rated passenger™s loss of directional control during takeoff and the pilot™s delayed 
remedial action, which resulted in a runway excursion and collision with trees.
Findings

Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=78478
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
