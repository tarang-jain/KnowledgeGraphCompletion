Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
St Mary's, KS
Accident Number:
CEN18LA027
Date & Time:
11/05/2017, 1140 CST 
Registration:
N618ER
Aircraft:
RIGGS KENNETH W T BIRD II
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Part(s) separation from AC
Injuries:
2 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot and passenger planned on a short flight around the traffic pattern in an open-
cockpit, light sport airplane. Shortly after takeoff, as the pilot turned downwind, he heard a 
"crack," and the engine started to vibrate and lose power. The pilot applied power, but the 
engine did not respond. He turned sharply left and then tried to stop the turn and descend, but 
the airplane continued to turn and descend until it impacted terrain. A witness saw two objects 
fall from the airplane shortly after the engine sound "stopped." Both objects were retrieved. 
The first object was the passenger's knitted hat, the top of which was "chewed up" and had a 
line burnt/melted into it. The other object was one of the propeller blades. The accident is 
consistent with the passenger's hat exiting the cockpit and impacting the three-bladed pusher 
propeller, which led to the separation of one of the propeller blades and the subsequent loss of 
engine power. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power due to a propeller failure when the passenger's hat exited the cockpit 
and impacted the three-bladed pusher propeller, separating one of the propeller blades.
Findings

Propeller blade section - Not specified (Cause)

Factual Information
On November 5, 2017, about 1140 central standard time, a T-Bird II airplane, N618ER, 
impacted terrain near St. Marys, Kansas. The pilot and passenger received serious injuries and 
the airplane was substantially damaged during the accident. The airplane was registered to and 
operated by a private individual under the provisions of 14 
Code of Federal Regulations Part
 
91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time. 
The pilot reported that he and the owner of the airplane planned to take the airplane for a 
flight around the traffic pattern to see if they were clothed warmly enough for another flight. 
They departed from runway 36, climbed to about 1,000 ft, and turned left for the downwind 
when they heard a loud "crack" and the engine started to vibrate. To avoid powerlines, the pilot 
applied power, but the engine did not respond. He turned sharply left, adding that he tried to 
stop the turn and decent; however, the elevators and ailerons did not respond. The airplane 
continued to turn and dropped rapidly, until it impacted a ravine.
A neighbor reported that she saw something "flutter" into a tree and something fell when the 
engine sound "stopped". The object in the tree was retrieved and was the passenger's knitted 
hat. The top of the hat was "chewed up" and had an area in the shape of a line, burnt/melted in 
it. The object that fell in the yard was also retrieved and was one of airplane's propeller blades. 
An examination of the airplane found substantial damage to the fuselage, and one blade from 
the three-bladed pusher propeller had separated from the propeller hub.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=96300
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
