Preventing Similar Accidents
Stay Centered: Preventing Loss of Control During Landing
Loss of control during landing is one of the leading causes of general aviation accidents and is 
often attributed to operational issues. Although most loss of control during landing accidents 
do not result in serious injuries, they typically require extensive airplane repairs and may 
involve potential damage to nearby objects such as fences, signs, and lighting.
Often, wind plays a role in these accidents. Landing in a crosswind presents challenges for 
pilots of all experience levels. Other wind conditions, such as gusting wind, tailwind, variable 
wind, or wind shifts, can also interfere with pilots™ abilities to land the airplane and maintain 
directional control.

What can pilots do?

Evaluate your mental and physical fitness before each flight using the Federal Aviation 
Administration™s (FAA) 
ﬁI'M SAFE Checklist."
 Being emotionally and physically ready 
will help you stay alert and potentially avoid common and preventable loss of control 
during landing accidents.

Check wind conditions and forecasts often. Take time during every approach briefing to 
fully understand the wind conditions. Use simple rules of thumb to help (for example, if 
the wind direction is 30 degrees off the runway heading, the crosswind component will 
be half of the total wind velocity).

Know your limitations and those of the airplane you are flying. Stay current and practice 
landings on different runways and during various wind conditions. If possible, practice 
with a flight instructor on board who can provide useful feedback and techniques for 
maintaining and improving your landing procedures.

Prepare early to perform a go around if the approach is not stabilized and does not go as 
planned or if you do not feel comfortable with the landing. Once you are airborne and 
stable again, you can decide to attempt to land again, reassess your landing runway, or 
land at an alternate airport. Incorporate go-around procedures into your recurrent 
training.

During landing, stay aligned with the centerline. Any misalignment reduces the time 
available to react if an unexpected event such as a wind gust or a tire blowout occurs.

Do not allow the airplane to touch down in a drift or in a crab. For airplanes with tricycle 
landing gear, do not allow the nosewheel to touch down first.

Maintain positive control of the airplane throughout the landing and be alert for 
directional control difficulties immediately upon and after touchdown. A loss of 
directional control can lead to a nose-over or ground loop, which can cause the airplane 
to tip or lean enough for the wing tip to contact the ground.

Stay mentally focused throughout the landing roll and taxi. During landing, avoid 
distractions, such as conversations with passengers or setting radio frequencies.

The FAA™s 
ﬁAirplane Flying Handbookﬂ
 (FAA-H-8083-3B), 
chapter 8,
 ﬁApproaches and 
Landings,ﬂ provides guidance about how to conduct crosswind approaches and landings and 
discusses maximum safe crosswind velocities. The handbook can be accessed from the FAA™s 
website
 (www.faa.gov).
The FAA Safety Team (FAASTeam) provides access to online training courses, seminars, and 
webinars as part of the FAA™s ﬁWINGSŠPilot Proficiency Program.ﬂ This program includes 
targeted flight training designed to help pilots develop the knowledge and skills needed to 
achieve flight proficiency and to assess and mitigate the risks associated with the most 
common causes of accidents, including loss of directional control. The courses listed below can

Investigation Docket:

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
