Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Skydiving
Analysis   
According to the pilot, he landed the airplane on the 1,800-ft-long asphalt runway in the rain at 
70 mph with full flaps. He reported that, on final, he had considered conducting a go-around 
due to wind and weather, but "we were low, slow, and 130 pounds below maximum gross 
weight with very dynamic wind conditions at the time and –apartment buildings about 400 
yards beyond the end of runway 19." During the landing, he touched down with a right 
crosswind, about 600 ft beyond the runway threshold.
He recalled that he retracted the flaps and pulled the control wheel all the way aft to put as 
much weight as possible on the main wheels, but he "felt our ground speed was fast and we 
must have a tailwind." He applied heavy braking, and as the end of the runway approached, he 
applied full left rudder to avoid a gully that was just beyond the end of the runway. The 
airplane exited the end of the runway and veered left. The airplane entered the gully and 
impacted vegetation.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right-wing spar and aileron.
The nearest METAR was 10 nautical miles east of the accident site, and it reported that the 
wind was from 270° at 13 knots, gusting to 20 knots. The visibility was 10 statute miles with 
light rain. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
Per the National Transportation Safety Board Pilot Aircraft Accident Report, the pilot noted 
that the accident could have been prevented by initiating a go-around after he realized that he 
could not land in the first third of the runway. He noted that the approaching rain and wind 
conditions added personal pressure to land before conditions deteriorated. Additionally, he 
reported that under normal, dry conditions, heavy braking was required to prevent an overrun.

Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's unstabilized approach and failure to go around in rainy, gusting crosswind 
conditions, which resulted in a runway overrun. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's 
self-induced pressure to land due to the deteriorating weather conditions.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
