GAA17CA473
Date & Time:
08/01/2017, 1900 AKD 
Registration:
N9455C
Aircraft:
CESSNA 180
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
According to the pilot, he made two passes over a dry creek bed to assess a potential landing 
site. The second pass was accomplished up-creek into rising terrain. The airplane was 
configured with full power and with flaps at 20°, and it was about 50 ft above ground level at 
80 mph. The pilot reported that the airplane encountered a downdraft as it transitioned from 
overflying the trees to overflying the creek bed, which he attempted to correct, but the airplane 
aerodynamically stalled.
Following the stall, the pilot attempted to land on a dry creek bed. The airplane touched down 
on the creek bed, then bounced and descended into a "dry cut channel." The airplane came to 
rest nose down in a near vertical position. The airplane was destroyed by a postcrash fire.
According to the National Transportation Safety Board's Pilot Aircraft Accident Report, the 
pilot reported that the event could have been avoided by making the low pass along descending 
terrain at a higher airspeed. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The airplane's encounter with a downdraft while maneuvering at a low altitude, which resulted 
in the exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack and a subsequent aerodynamic stall.

Note:

to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=95763
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
