Aviation Accident Preliminary Report
Location:
Blythe, CA
Accident Number:
WPR18LA018
Date & Time:
10/03/2017, 1521 PDT 
Registration:
N418CP
Aircraft:
CIRRUS DESIGN CORP SR22
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
On October 3, 2017, about 1521 Pacific daylight time, a Cirrus Design Corp SR22, N418CP, 
sustained substantial damage during an emergency landing after a reported loss of engine 
power near the Blythe Airport (BLH) Blythe, California. The flight instructor and commercial 
pilot sustained minor injuries. The airplane was registered to Clayisawesome LLC, and 
operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 
Code of Federal Regulations
 Part 91 as a 
personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the 
instructional cross-country flight. The flight departed Camarillo Airport, Camarillo, California, 
about 1330, with a planned destination of Safford Regional Airport, Safford, Arizona. 
According to the flight instructor, the flight was to reposition the airplane to a new owner and 
to provide advanced transition training to the pilot onboard. After an uneventful takeoff, they 
climbed and leveled off at a cruise altitude of about 11,500 ft mean sea level. About 1.5 hours 
into the flight, the oil pressure started to decrease, and they decided to divert to BLH. Inbound 
to BLH, the oil pressure continued to decrease until it indicated less than 5 psi. Shortly 
thereafter, the engine completely lost power. Unable to make the runway, they elected to 
activate the airplane's parachute system. The parachute system was successfully deployed 
inflight, and upon ground impact, the airplane was dragged for about 20 ft before they could 
egress from the airplane. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane by the NTSB investigator-in-charge revealed 
substantial damage to the fuselage and engine firewall. The airplane was recovered to a secure 
storage facility for further examination.
