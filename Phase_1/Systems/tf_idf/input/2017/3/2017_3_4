Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The sport pilot reported that he was landing on an airfield and overflew the runway multiple 
times searching for a wind sock. He watched another airplane land to the south, and he made 
his approach to the south also. He reported that his altitude was too high during his first 
approach, so he aborted the landing. He asserted that, "This should have alerted me that there 
was a tailwind." He flew one traffic pattern and made a second approach with the power at idle 
and full flaps. He established his approach, but the airplane sank quickly and touched down 
short of the runway and nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the canopy, 
the vertical stabilizer, and the rudder. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
According to the Airport Facility Directory, the airfield was equipped with a wind indicator. 
However, no wind indicator could be located on or near the airfield by the National 
Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The sport pilot's unstabilized approach with a tailwind, which resulted in touchdown short of 
the runway and a subsequent nose-over.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
