Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Burnet, TX
Accident Number:
CEN17LA336
Date & Time:
09/02/2017, 1645 CDT 
Registration:
N50MP
Aircraft:
HUGHES 369A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 Minor, 1 
None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Business
Analysis 
The pilot and two passengers had conducted aerial hog hunt operations from a helicopter and 
were en route to an airport when the engine lost power. The pilot conducted an autorotation to 
a road; however, the helicopter landed hard, resulting in substantial damage. An examination 
of the helicopter revealed that the fuel tank was empty, and no residual fuel was found in the 
system. Since the pilot was en route to an airport where fuel was available, it is likely that he 
spent too much time airborne and misjudged the amount of fuel needed to reach the 
destination. The accident is consistent with a fuel exhaustion event.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate inflight decision making, which resulted in a total loss of engine power 
due to fuel exhaustion.

Factual Information
On September 2, 2017, about 1645 central daylight time, a Hughes 369A helicopter, N50MP, 
conducted an autorotation near Burnet, Texas. The pilot was not injured, one passenger 
received minor injuries, and one passenger received serious injuries. The helicopter was 
substantially damaged during the landing. The helicopter was registered to and operated by 
Lyft, LLC, Missoula, Montana, under the provisions of 14 
Code of Federal Regulations Part 
91. 
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. 
According to the responding Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, the pilot and 
two passengers were conducting aerial hog hunt operations. The helicopter was en route to the 
Burnet Municipal Airport-Kate Craddock Field Burnet Municipal airport (KBMQ), Burnet, 
Texas, when the engine lost power. The pilot conducted an autorotation to a road; however, the 
helicopter landed hard, resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage and tailboom.
The FAA inspector used a dip stick to check the fuel tank; the fuel tank was empty. The 
inspector also looked at the pump/injector and check valve; however, no residual fuel was 
found. The inspector checked the last place the helicopter was refuel, noting that the station's 
filters were not contaminated and that other people had purchased fuel and no problems had 
been reported.
The pilot did not return a completed an NTSB 6120 form.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=95941
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
