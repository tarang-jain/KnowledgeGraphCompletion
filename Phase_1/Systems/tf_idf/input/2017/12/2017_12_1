On December 1, 2017, about 1615 eastern standard time, a Champion 7EC, N7586E, was 
substantially damaged while landing at Jackson County Airport (I18), Ravenswood, West 
Virginia. The commercial pilot was not injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by 
an individual as a Title 14
 Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 91 personal flight. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident and no flight plan was filed for 
the local flight.
According to the pilot, he performed a circuit in the traffic pattern that was uneventful. The 
airplane was on final approach, at 50 mph and aligned with the runway centerline. The pilot 
then performed a three-point landing, and as the airplane's speed decreased, it began to veer to 
the right side of the runway. The pilot applied left aileron and full left rudder; however, the 
airplane continued off the right side of the runway. He applied full power to attempt to abort 
the landing, but after about 60 ft of ground roll, the airplane went down an embankment and 
came to rest. The pilot then egressed without injury and noted tire marks approximately 200 ft 
long on the runway and an additional 100 ft in the grass prior to going off the embankment.
Initial examination of the airplane revealed that the right wing, right horizontal stabilizer, right 
elevator, and fuselage were substantially damaged. In addition, the right main landing gear 
separated from the airplane. The airplane was retained for further examination.
