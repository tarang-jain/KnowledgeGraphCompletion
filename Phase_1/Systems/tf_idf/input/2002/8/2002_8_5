08/01/2002, 1300 CDT 
Registration:
N1029G
Aircraft:
Giroux Air Cam
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The amateur built airplane collided with trees during the climb phase of an aborted landing.  
The pilot reported that while on short final the airplane seemed to be traveling faster than 
normal although the airspeed indicator was indicating a normal approach speed of about 45 
mph.  He stated the airplane floated during the landing.  He reported that he applied the 
brakes when the main gear touched down, but the airplane still seemed to be going too fast.  He 
stated that he decided to go around when he reached a point approximately two-thirds the way 
down the 650 foot long landing area.  The pilot reported he added full power, but was unable to 
gain sufficient altitude to clear trees at the end of the landing area.  The airplane contacted the 
trees at an estimated altitude of about 20 feet.  The pilot reported the landing area was a 
combination of a gravel driveway and grass area.  He stated the normal landing distance for the 
airplane is about 250 feet.  The normal takeoff distance with two adults and at gross weight is 
about 160 feet.  The landing was being made to the west and the pilot reported the local winds 
were from the west southwest at 5 to 8 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's delay in aborting the landing.  A contributing factor was the excessive airspeed.

Factual Information
On August 1, 2002, at 1300 central daylight time, an amateur built Air Cam, N1029G, collided 
with trees during the climb phase of an aborted landing on private property near the town of 
Ozawkie, Kansas.  The private pilot and his passenger were not injured.  The airplane was 
substantially damaged.  The Title 14 CFR Part 91 flight was operating in visual meteorological 
conditions without a flight plan.  The flight originated from Topeka, Kansas, at 1030.
The pilot reported that while on short final the airplane seemed to be traveling faster than 
normal.  He stated that the airspeed indicator was indicating about 45 mph which is a normal 
approach speed.  He stated the airplane floated during the landing.  He reported that he 
applied the brakes when the main gear touched down, but the airplane still seemed to be going 
too fast.  He stated that he decided to go around when he reached a point approximately two-
thirds the way down the 650 foot long landing area.  The pilot reported he added full power, 
but was unable to gain sufficient altitude to clear trees at the end of the landing area.  The 
airplane contacted the trees at an estimated altitude of about 20 feet.
The pilot reported the landing area was a combination of a gravel driveway and grass area.  He 
stated the normal landing distance for the airplane is about 250 feet.  The normal takeoff 
distance with two adults and at gross weight is about 160 feet.
The landing was being made to the west and the pilot reported the local winds were from the 
west southwest at 5 to 8 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
