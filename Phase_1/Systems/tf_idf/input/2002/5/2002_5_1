Analysis 
The airplane was damaged during a wheels-up landing.  The flight was a non-revenue dual-

happened had each of us been alone.  We got involved with each other and we both missed the 
final check."  The repair work order did not list any landing gear components that were 
repaired or replaced.

Factual Information
On May 1, 2002, about 1505 central daylight time, a Beech BE58, N4097S, was substantially 
damaged during a wheels-up landing on runway 09 (3,395 feet by 75 feet, asphalt) at the 
Lansing Municipal Airport, Lansing, Illinois.  The 14 CFR Part 91 positioning flight was 
operating in visual meteorological conditions without a flight plan.  The flight was being 
conducted by an airline transport pilot seated in the right seat and a commercial pilot seated in 
the left seat.  It was reported that the right seat pilot was providing flight instruction to the left 
seat pilot.  Neither pilot was injured.  The flight originated from Detroit, Michigan, at an 
undetermined time.  The extent of the aircraft damage was originally reported to have been 
minor.  The National Transportation Safety Board was not informed of the true extent of the 
damage until April of 2004.
A work order provided by the aircraft owner indicates that the repairs to the airplane included 
lower fuselage skins, angles, stiffeners, and stringers.  No repairs or replacement of landing 
gear components was indicated on the work order.
As of August 20, 2004, the right seat pilot has not submitted a report of the accident.
The aircraft owner provided a notarized questionnaire signed by the pilot that was seated in the 
left seat.  The left seat pilot stated that the airplane was landed with the landing gear still in the 
retracted position.  He also stated that he was the pilot flying the airplane and receiving dual-
instruction on a non-revenue flight when the accident occurred.  The left seat pilot stated that 
the accident, "...would not have happened had each of us been alone.  We got involved with 
each other and we both missed the final check."
At the time of the accident, the pilot-in-command did not possess a multi-engine flight 
instructor rating.
At the time of the accident, both pilot's possessed pilot certificates with multi-engine ratings.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
