Hailey, ID
Accident Number:
SEA02LA046
Date & Time:
03/01/2002, 1936 MST 
Registration:
N421DG
Aircraft:
Cessna 421C
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
While on approach to the Friedman Memorial airport (Hailey, Idaho), the pilot  of the Cessna 
421C lowered the landing gear but failed to receive a gear down and locked indication on the 
right main gear.  He attempted to lower the landing gear utilizing the nitrogen blow down 
system, again without success.  The pilot then executed a landing with the nose and left main 
gear extended.  Post-crash examination revealed a small amount of water in the landing gear 
hydraulic lines.  When the landing gear system was purged and replenished with 
uncontaminated fluid the gear operated without malfunction both normally and with the use of 
the blow down system.  Temperature at Hailey, Idaho, remained well below freezing before and 
after the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Water contamination within the aircraft's landing gear hydraulic line(s) which froze and 
blocked the line(s) preventing extension of the right main gear.  A factor was the below freezing 
environmental conditions which the aircraft was operating in prior to and during the approach 
and landing.

Factual Information
On March 1, 2002, at 1936 mountain standard time, a Cessna 421C, N421DG, registered to and 
being flown by a private pilot, sustained substantial damage during a gear up landing on 
runway 31 at the Friedman Memorial airport, Hailey, Idaho.  The pilot and passenger were 
uninjured.  Visual meteorological conditions existed and an IFR flight plan had been activated.  
The flight, which was personal, was operated under 14CFR91, and originated from Santa 
Monica, California, earlier in the day, and was destined for Hailey.
As the aircraft approached Hailey, the pilot reported that he was unable to obtain a down and 
locked status on the right main landing gear.  He then attempted a manual extension of the 
landing gear using the nitrogen blow down system, but again was unable to get a down and 
locked indication on the right main gear.  The aircraft was landed with the nose and left main 
gear extended and during the initial landing roll the right wing impacted the runway.
An examination and testing of the aircraft's landing gear and associated hydraulic systems was 
conducted under the oversight of an inspector from the Federal Aviation Administration's 
(FAA) Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) at Boise, Idaho.  The hydraulic system was 
drained and the fluid was captured.  Examination of the fluid yielded no particulate 
contaminants but a small amount of water was found in the fluid.  The hydraulic system was 
subsequently replenished and the aircraft was placed on jacks.  The landing gear was then 
cycled up and down repeatedly with no malfunction noted.  The landing gear was then 
extended utilizing the emergency extension system, again with no malfunction (refer to 
ATTACHMENT FAA-I).
The surface temperature at Friedman airport was well below freezing several hours before and 
after the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
