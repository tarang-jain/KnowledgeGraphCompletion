Factual Information
On June 1, 2002, about 0700 eastern daylight time, a homebuilt Comp Air 7SL, N753KD, was 
substantially damaged during a landing rollout at Cross Keys Airport (17N), Cross Keys, New 
Jersey.  The certificated private pilot, two pilot-rated passengers, and one additional passenger 
were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time.  No flight plan had 
been filed for the flight, from Old Mans Airport (7N7), Pedricktown, New Jersey.  The personal 
flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
The pilot reported that during the landing rollout on runway 27, the "tail wheel broke."  It then 
jammed into the rudder and elevator, "which caused [us] to lose our steering and control of the 
airplane."
One of the pilot-rated passengers stated that the "tail wheel broke and flipped up between the 
elevator, jamming the rudder and causing the aircraft to skid."  The airplane subsequently 
swerved off the right side of the runway, and came to rest in a drainage ditch.  
According to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, the tailwheel spring fractured 
and jammed the rudder.  The airplane veered off the runway, the main landing gear collapsed, 
and the fuselage and wings were damaged.  Examination of the spring revealed previous 
damage, including beach marks and rust on the fracture surfaces.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
