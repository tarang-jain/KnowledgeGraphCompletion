Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot said the airplane was parked on a remote beach on an Island.  He noticed an 
approaching storm, and decided to reposition the airplane on a logging road away from the 
beach.  During the landing roll on the logging road, the right wing struck a tree, and as the 
airplane turned sharply to the right, the left main landing gear struck a berm and collapsed, 
allowing the left wing to impact the ground.  The airplane sustained damage to both wings, the 
left landing gear and propeller.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's selection of unsuitable terrain for landing and his failure to maintain obstacle 
clearance which resulted in the airplane colliding with a tree and a berm.
Findings
Occurrence #1: ON GROUND/WATER COLLISION WITH OBJECT
Phase of Operation: LANDING - ROLL
Findings
1. OBJECT - TREE(S)
2. TERRAIN CONDITION - BERM

On December 1, 2002, about 1530 Alaska standard time, a Piper PA-18-150 airplane, N7002Z, 
sustained substantial damage when it collided with a tree during the landing roll on a logging 
road, about 20 statute miles southeast of Chenega Bay, Alaska.  The airplane was being 
operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) personal flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the 
accident occurred.  The solo airline transport pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed.
During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)

a beach in San Juan Bay, Montague Island, Alaska, when he noticed an approaching storm.  
The pilot said he decided to reposition the airplane on a logging road away from the beach.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
