Factual Information
On September 2, 2002, about 1700 Alaska daylight time, a tundra tire-equipped Piper PA-12 
airplane, N3233M, sustained substantial damage when it nosed over during landing at a 
remote airstrip, about 20 miles north of Chickaloon, Alaska.  The airplane was being operated 
as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country positioning flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91, when 
the accident occurred.  The airplane was operated by Grasshopper Aviation, Wasilla, Alaska.  
The commercial certificated pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed, and VFR company flight following procedures were in effect. The flight 
originated at the Wasilla Airport, about 1615.
During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
investigator-in-charge (IIC), on September 3, the pilot reported he was landing on an airstrip 
known as 30 mile strip to pick up a hunter.  The gravel surface airstrip, oriented north/south, 
is about 900 feet long and 10 feet wide.  The pilot said he was landing toward the north.  
During the landing roll, the pilot reported that the tail came up too high, and the airplane 
nosed over.  The airplane received damage to the propeller, cowling, right wing, the right wing 
lift strut, and the top of the rudder.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
