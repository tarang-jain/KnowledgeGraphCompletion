Factual Information
 On August 1, 1993, at approximately 0915 central daylight time, a Cessna 150M, N66081, 
sustained substantial damage near Bald Knob, Arkansas, during a forced landing following a 
loss of engine power. The private pilot was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed for the personal cross country flight.
During interviews, conducted by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, with the 
pilot the following information was revealed. The pilot departed Lexington, Mississippi, at 
0710 after adding ten gallons of fuel for the planned two hour flight to Batesville, Arkansas. 
Approximately 20 minutes from the destination, the engine lost power. A forced landing was 
initiated to a field. During the landing roll, the nose gear collapsed when it hit a hole in the 
uneven terrain.
The Pilot/Operator report submitted to the Safety Board, revealed that fuel on board at 
departure was 19 gallons.
During an on site examination of the fuel system by a FAA inspector, the fuel tank integrity had 
not been compromised and no fuel was found in the left fuel tank and less than one gallon was 
found in the right fuel tank.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
