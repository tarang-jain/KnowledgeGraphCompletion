Factual Information
 On August 1, 1993, at 1615 eastern daylight time, a Molino OY PIK-20, N3WX was 
substantially damaged following a collision with terrain during an attempted go around at 
Swan Creek Airport near Jonesville, North Carolina. The glider-only rated private pilot was not 
injured in the accident. The aircraft was being operated under 14 CFR Part 91 by the pilot. 
Visual meteorological conditions existed at the time, and no flight plan had been filed for the 
local, personal flight.
The pilot reported that he was high on his final approach for landing and attempted a go-
around. He stated that when he retracted the landing gear and flaps, the aircraft stalled and 
spiraled into the terrain about 1/4 mile from the runway. The glider impacted on its left wing 
tip in a nose-low attitude and came to rest inverted in a cornfield.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
