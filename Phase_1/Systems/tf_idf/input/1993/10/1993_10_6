Factual Information
 On Friday, October 1, 1993, at about 2100 eastern daylight time,  a Cessna 172, N736RZ, 
collided with a VASI light while landing at the Mt. Gilead Airport, Mt. Gilead, Ohio.  The 
airplane was substantially damaged.  The pilot and the three passengers were not injured.  
Visual meteorological         conditions prevailed at the time, and no flight plan had been     filed.  
The flight was being conducted under 14 CFR 91.          
The pilot had completed a night landing and heard a "thump."      After deplaning, he observed 
damage to the left horizontal        stabilizer.  Further investigation revealed that the airplane 
had collided with VASI lights located off the side of the runway in   the vicinity of the 
touchdown zone.                              
According to the pilot's statement on the NTSB Form 6120.1/2:

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
