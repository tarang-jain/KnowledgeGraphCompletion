Factual Information
 On October 1, 1993, at 2344 central daylight time, a Cessna 208B, N9762B, was substantially 
damaged following a loss of control while taxiing at the Dallas Fort Worth International 
Airport (DFW), Texas.  The airline transport rated pilot was not injured.
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the 14 CFR Part 135 on demand air taxi flight.     
According to the pilot, the all cargo flight operating under the call sign "Martinaire 639" 
departed Tulsa, Oklahoma, at 2201 on an IFR flight plan.  A normal approach and landing were 
executed to Runway 17R at the DFW Airport.  The pilot was instructed to hold short of Runway 
17L, on taxiway 18, prior to taxiing to the northeast cargo area.
According to the enclosed ATC transcript, Martinaire 639 was instructed to cross Runway 17L 
at 2236:53, behind a heavy MD-11 that was previously cleared for takeoff at 2235:53. Prior to 
issuing the clearance to cross, the pilot was issued a wake turbulence caution.  The pilot stated 
that as he was in the process of crossing the runway, the MD-11 advanced its engines to takeoff 
power.  The jet blast from the departing MD-11 struck the Cessna 208B and "blew my aircraft 
off of the runway."  
The left wing impacted the ground resulting in structural damage to the wing spar.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
