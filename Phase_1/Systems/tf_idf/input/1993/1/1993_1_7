Analysis 
 DURING A TOUCH AND GO AT MID STATE AIRPORT, UPON TOUCH DOWN AND 
LOWERING OF THE AIRPLANE'S NOSE ON RUNWAY 24, THE STUDENT PILOT AND CFI 
NOTICED A SNOW BANK ACROSS THE RUNWAY AT THE INTERSECTION OF RUNWAY 
16/34.  THE CFI INSTRUCTED THE STUDENT TO TAKEOFF IMMEDIATELY.  THE 
STUDENT APPLIED FULL TAKEOFF POWER, AND JUST AFTER LIFT OFF THEY HEARD 
A 'THUMP'.  THE AIRPLANE'S LEFT MAIN GEAR IMPACTED THE SNOW BANK AND WAS 
TORN AWAY FROM THE AIRPLANE CAUSING SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE TO THE 
HORIZONTAL STABILIZER AND LEFT WING AND FLAP.  THE STUDENT AND CFI 
CONTINUED THE TAKEOFF AND RETURNED TO THEIR BASE AIRPORT WHERE A FLY 
BY WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND A DAMAGE ASSESSMENT WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY 
GROUND PERSONNEL.  THE CFI MADE AN EMERGENCY LANDING AND THE AIRPLANE 
OCCUPANTS EXITED THE AIRPLANE WITH NO REPORTED INJURIES.  THE CFI STATED 
THAT THEY DID FLY OVER MID STATE AIRPORT PRIOR TO LANDING AND THAT THEY 
DID NOT SEE ANYTHING ON THE RUNWAY. THE MANAGER OF MID STATE AIRPORT 
REPORTED THAT THE PERSON WHO SNOW PLOWED RUNWAY 16/34 WAS NEW TO 
THE AIRPORT AND WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE OTHER RUNWAY WAS IN USE, 
HENCE, DID NOT REMOVE THE PLOWED SNOW FROM THE INTERSECTING RUNWAY.  
THERE WERE NO NOTICES TO AIRMEN PUBLISHED CONCERNING A CLOSURE OF 
RUNWAY 24.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
