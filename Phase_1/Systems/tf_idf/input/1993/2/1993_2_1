Analysis 
THE STUDENT PILOT WAS MAKING A FULL FLAP SOFT FIELD LANDING WHEN A GUST 
OF WIND MOVED THE AIRPLANE OFF THE RUNWAY AND ONTO GRASS DURING THE 
FLARE. THE PILOT RAISED THE FLAPS AND ADDED FULL POWER TO TAKE OFF FROM 
THE DENSE GRASS. HE THEN ABORTED THE TAKEOFF ATTEMPT AND THE AIRPLANE 
COLLIDED WITH A FENCE AND SEVERAL TREES. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE STUDENT PILOT'S INADEQUATE COMPENSATION FOR THE GUSTY CROSSWIND, 
AND HIS IMPROPER DECISION TO ATTEMPT A TAKEOFF AFTER TOUCHING DOWN 
OFF THE RUNWAY SURFACE. FACTORS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT 
WAS THE GUSTING WIND CONDITION AND THE HIGH GRASS.

Factual Information
 On February 1, 1993, at approximately 1645 central standard time, a Cessna 150M, N9199U, 
was substantially damaged when it impacted with a tree and a fence after an on ground loss of 
control occurred during takeoff from runway 35 at Bowie Municipal Airport, Bowie, Texas. The 
student pilot was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the solo 
instructional flight.
The information in the following paragraphs was reported to the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) inspector by the student and the instructor. The intent of the flight from 
McKinney Municipal Airport to Bowie and return was for cross country navigation and solo 
touch and go training before taking the private pilot FAA check ride. It was reported that the 
student had landed on runway 35 using full flaps and a soft field method before shutting down 
on the ramp. He restarted the airplane and taxied for takeoff.                                                                  
The student remained in the traffic pattern and proceeded to execute a simulated soft field 
landing to a touch and go. According to the student, the airplane had full flaps selected and an 
airspeed of approximately 60 knots. He stated that before touchdown, a wind gust moved the 
airplane off to the left side of the runway. He lost directional control of the airplane. One main 
landing gear touched onto the runway's surface and the other onto the grass. He then 
attempted to takeoff from the grass and raised the flaps. The airplane's main gear dragged in 
the dense grass for approximately 1,000 feet before the pilot aborted the takeoff attempt. The 
airplane impacted a fence and several trees approximately 250 feet west of the runway. The 
pilot reported the wind was from the north northeast at 5 knots, gusting to 10. He recalled that 
once the accident was "imminent" he reduced power and attempted to guide the airplane 
between the trees. See the student's flight track diagram, which is attached to his statement.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
