Factual Information
 On June 1, 1993, about 1558 hours Pacific daylight time, a Boeing B75N- 1, N218DL, crashed 
during landing at Whiteman Field, Pacoima, California.  The airplane was being operated as a 
visual flight rules (VFR) cross country personal flight to Pacoima when the accident occurred.  
The airplane, operated by the pilot, received substantial damage.  The certificated private pilot, 
the sole occupant, was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  The flight 
originated from Brackett Field, La Verne, California, at 1530 hours.
The pilot reported that while landing on runway 12, a cross wind condition from 180 degrees at 
9 knots was present.  During the landing roll-out, the airplane veered to the right and departed 
the runway.  The airplane began to ground loop and the pilot applied hard braking.  The 
airplane then nosed over.
The pilot holds a private pilot certificate with an airplane single engine land rating.  The most 
recent third class medical certificate was issued to the pilot on February 24, 1993, and 
contained the limitation that the pilot must have available glasses for near vision while 
exercising the privileges of his airman certificate.
According to the pilot/operator report submitted by the pilot, his total aeronautical experience 
consists of about 283.1 hours, of which 242.9 were accrued in the accident airplane.  In the 
preceding 90 and 30 days prior to the accident, the report lists a total of 35.5 and 3.7 hours 
respectively flown.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
