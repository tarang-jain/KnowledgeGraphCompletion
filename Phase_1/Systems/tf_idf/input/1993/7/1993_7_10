Factual Information
 On July 2, 1993, at 1000 Alaska daylight time, a float equipped Maule M4 airplane, N9872M, 
registered to and operated by the pilot in command, nosed over while taxiing on Char Lake, 
approximately 20 miles southwest of Iliamna, Alaska.  The private certificated pilot and one

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
