Analysis 
 THE AIRPLANE DEPARTED A RESTRICTED LANDING AREA RUNWAY FOR A LOCAL 
FLIGHT. SHORTLY AFTER DEPARTING, AT 300 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND, THE 
AIRPLANE'S ENGINE STOPPED RUNNING.  THE PILOT PERFORMED A 180 DEGREE 
TURN TOWARD THE DEPARTURE RUNWAY. DURING THE TURN THE AIRPLANE 
STALLED AND SUBSEQUENTLY COLLIDED WITH THE GROUND.  THE AIRPLANE WAS 
DESTROYED BY A POST IMPACT FIRE.  THE ON-SCENE INVESTIGATION REVEALED A 
CARBURETOR FLOAT WITH MULTIPLE CRACKS IN IT.  LIQUID EMERSION OF THE 
FLOAT REVEALED LIQUID PENETRATION INTO THE FLOAT. THE LAST ANNUAL 
INSPECTION WAS PERFORMED 21 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
