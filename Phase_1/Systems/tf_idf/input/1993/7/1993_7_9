Factual Information
 On July 2, 1993, at 1000 Alaska daylight time, a float equipped Cessna 206 airplane, N1801Q, 
registered to Alaska Bush Carriers, Inc. of Anchorage, Alaska, and operated by the pilot in 
command, nosed over while taxiing from a landing at the confluence of Lake Creek and the 
Yetna River, approximately 10 miles southeast of Skwentna, Alaska.  The commercial 
certificated pilot in command, the sole occupant, was not injured and the airplane sustained 
substantial damage.  The positioning flight, operating under 14 CFR Part 91, last departed the 
Lake Hood Seaplane Base at approximately 0930 and the destination was the accident site.  A 
company flight plan was filed and visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  
During a telephone interview, the pilot in command told the NTSB investigator in charge that 
just after coming off of the step from a water landing, the airplane collided with a sandbar and 
nosed over.  The pilot reported that the landing was performed to pick up a group of sport 
fishermen.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
