Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On July 1, 1993, about 0905 central daylight time, a Piper PA-28- 140, N5473S was 
substantially damaged following a collision with terrain during an emergency landing near 
Clayton, Alabama. The student pilot was fatally injured in the accident. The aircraft was being 
operated under 14 CFR Part 91 by the pilot. Visual meteorological conditions existed at the 
time of the accident, and no flight plan had been filed for the personal flight. The flight 
departed Enterprise, Alabama about 0830, and was enroute to Fayetteville, North Carolina at 
the time of the accident.
Personnel at the Columbus, Georgia, Air Traffic Control Tower (ATC) stated that the pilot was 
in radio communication with their facility prior to the accident. The personnel stated that the 
pilot advised that he was descending from 5500 feet to 3500 feet. He later reported that his 
altitude was 2800 feet. About 0900, the tower received a distress call from the pilot. He 
reported that he was having engine trouble and could not maintain altitude. The ATC 
personnel gave him directions toward the nearest airport. The last radio transmission received 
was at 0905, and the pilot reported his altitude as 900 feet.
The aircraft wreckage was located in a wooded area near Clayton, Alabama.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
The pilot held a student pilot certificate. He was enrolled in the United States Army Aviation 
School, and had completed all of the flight training for the helicopter pilot program. He was 
awaiting the graduation ceremony to receive his United States Army Aviator Wings.
Additional pilot information may be obtained on Page 3 of this report.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
Aircraft maintenance records showed that the last Annual Inspection was completed February 
8, 1993. An invoice, provided by the aircraft owner, showed that the carburetor was removed, 
disassembled, inspected, reassembled, and reinstalled in the aircraft on March 2, 1993. No 
record of this maintenance was recorded in the aircraft, nor engine log books.
Additional aircraft information may be obtained on Page 2 of this report.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
Meteorological information may be obtained on Page 4 of this report.
WRECKAGE INFORMATION
The aircraft wreckage was located in a wooded area. The wreckage was distributed over an area 
approximately 123 feet in length, and on a heading of approximately 195 degrees.
The first indication of the wreckage path were two pine trees approximately 12 inches in 
diameter and 60 feet in height, which had been severed at approximately 45 feet above ground 
level.
A section of the left outboard wing, approximately five feet in length, was located 
approximately 15 feet in the direction of and 30 feet to the left of the wreckage path. Tree bark 
was found on the leading edge of the wing section.

The remainder of the left wing was located approximately 66 feet in the direction of and 10 feet 
to the right of the wreckage path. This section of the wing also had evidence of tree bark on the 
leading edge. There was chordwise crushing of the leading edge of this section of the wing.
An outboard section of the right wing, approximately 5 feet in length, was located 
approximately 99 feet in the direction of and 5 feet to the right of the wreckage path. The 
leading edge of this section had a large "U" shaped indention just inboard of the wing tip 
faring.
The main wreckage, consisting of the fuselage, empennage, and remainder of the right wing 
were located, in an upright position, approximately 123 feet in the direction of the wreckage 
path. The engine and propeller were still attached to the fuselage. There was extensive 
deformation of the left side of the cockpit area. There was continuity of the aircraft flight 
controls from the rudder and elevator.
A test run of the aircraft engine was conducted after removing the aircraft from the wooded 
area. Prior to the test run, the spark plugs were removed and inspected. The spark plugs 
showed signs of sooting. The engine operated to 2550 revolutions per minute (RPM). The 
engine ran roughly at full rich mixture settings, but smoothed out and ran to full RPM after 
reducing the mixture control to approximately half. Inspection revealed that the carburetor 
housing bolts were loose, and could be rotated by hand. There was fuel leaking from the 
carburetor housing during the test run of the engine.  
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
An autopsy was performed by Dr. Allan D. Stillwell of the Alabama Department of Forensic 
Sciences on July 2, 1993.
The toxicological report was negative for the presence of ethanol and drugs.
TESTS AND RESEARCH
On January 25, 1994, an inspection of the aircraft carburetor, Marvel Schebler Model Number 
MA-45SPA, Part Number 10-5009, Serial Number BL 9 4397 was conducted. The inspection 
revealed that the carburetor had not been stamped MFV indicating compliance with an 
airworthiness directive requiring the installation of a one piece venturi. 
The carburetor housing bolts were loose, and could be turned by hand. The throttle shaft and 
bushings had excessive wear, and were loose in the housing. The carburetor still had the two 
piece venturi installed. The float pendulum was not even, with the right side resting lower than 
the left.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The aircraft wreckage was released to Mr. Donald R. Andersen, attorney for the owner on 
March 17, 1994.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
