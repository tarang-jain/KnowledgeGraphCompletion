Analysis 
A PICKUP TRUCK WAS POSITIONED AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY WITH ITS 
HEADLIGHTS ON TO GUIDE THE PILOT TO HIS UNLIGHTED PRIVATE STRIP. THE 
PILOT SAID HE WAS TOO LOW ON THE APPROACH, AND THE NOSE GEAR STRUCK THE 
TOP OF THE TRUCK CAB. THREE CHILDREN AND AN ADULT WERE SITTING IN THE 
TRUCK. A FOUR-YEAR-OLD CHILD RECEIVED SERIOUS HEAD INJURIES. THE 
AIRPLANE SUBSEQUENTLY MADE A WHEELS-UP LANDING. 
Probable Cause and Findings

THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE CLEARANCE FROM

AND THE DRIVER'S POOR JUDGEMENT IN NOT VACATING ALL PERSONNEL FROM 
THE TRUCK.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
