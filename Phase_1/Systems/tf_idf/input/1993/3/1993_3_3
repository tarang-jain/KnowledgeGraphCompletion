Analysis 
THE INSTRUMENT RATED PILOT DEPARTED DURING MARGINAL VFR CONDITIONS.  
ABOUT  48 MINUTES LATER, THE PILOT CONTACTED THE AIR ROUTE TRAFFIC 
CONTROL CENTER  AND ADVISED HIM THAT HE WAS UNSURE OF HIS POSITION AND 
REQUESTED ASSISTANCE. THE SECTOR CONTROLLER COULD NOT RADAR IDENTIFY 
THE AIRPLANE AND INSTRUCTED  THE PILOT TO CONTACT ANOTHER SECTOR 
CONTROLLER.  THE PILOT BECAME CONFUSED  AND ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT 
VARIOUS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS WITHOUT SUCCESS.   AN AIRCRAFT IN THE 
VICINITY OF THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE MADE INITIAL VISUAL  CONTACT, BUT THE 
ACCIDENT AIRPLANE ENTERED INTO THE CLOUDS AND COULD NOT BE RELOCATED.  
THE AIRLANE'S LEFT WING STRUCK SOME TREES IN A MOUNTAINOUS AREA WHILE 
IN A STEEP DESCENDING ATTITUDE.  THE WRECKAGE EXAMINATION DISCLOSED NO 
EVIDENCE OF ANY PREEXISTING MALFUNCTIONS OR FAILURES. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S POOR WEATHER EVALUATION AND CONTINUED FLIGHT INTO 
INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. THE LOW CEILING WAS A FACTOR.

Factual Information
 History of the Flight
On March 1, 1993, at about 1758 hours Pacific standard time, an amateur built Langerud 
Varieze airplane, N91CL, collided with some trees after encountering instrument 
meteorological conditions about 10 miles northwest of Zenia, California.  The pilot was 
conducting a visual flight rules (vfr) personal flight to Hayward, California, and he did not file a 
flight plan.  The airplane, owned and operated by the pilot, was destroyed.  The certificated 
private pilot, the sole occupant, sustained fatal injuries.  The flight originated at Roseburg 
Municipal Airport (RBG), Roseburg, Oregon, at about 1600 hours.  Search and Rescue 
personnel found the wreckage on March 12, 1993, at 0945 hours.
The registered owner told Mr. Pete Wilhelmson, airworthiness inspector, Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA), Sacramento [California] Flight Standards District Office, that the pilot 
purchased the airplane on the accident date.  The pilot only performed two or three high speed 
taxi runs before departing on the accident flight.
At 1040 hours, the pilot contacted the McMinnville [Oregon] Automated Flight Service Station 
(AFSS) and requested and received a weather briefing from Roseburg, Oregon, to Hayward, 
California.  The AFSS specialist provided the pilot with the current and forecasted weather 
which indicated that visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  The cloud bases along the 
pilot's intended route of flight varied between 4,500 feet to 7,500 feet msl along the northern 
route of the flight; the cloud bases varied between 2,500 msl feet to clear conditions along the 
southern route of the flight.  The AFSS specialist advised the pilot that a frontal system was off 
the coast and moving east and that the freezing level was between 6,000 to 8,000 feet msl.
The AFSS specialist advised the pilot that all navigational aids along the pilot's intended route 
of flight were operational.  He also advised the pilot that no notice to airman's (NOTAMS) 
existed at Hayward Airport.
At 1648:21 hours, the pilot contacted the Seattle ARTCC R-36 sector controller and reported 
that he was "...a little lost." The controller asked the pilot his location and instructed him to 
squawk [set code on his transponder] 6640.  The pilot acknowledged the controllers 
instructions and stated that he was "...about twenty miles or thirty er I'm not sure south of Fort 
Jones [VOR - a very high frequency omni range navigational facility] at 10,000 feet mean sea 
level (msl).
The R-36 sector controller asked the pilot his heading and the pilot responded 170 degrees [all 
headings/bearings in this report are oriented toward magnetic north].  At 1650:51 hours, the 
sector controller asked the pilot if he was receiving the Red Bluff [California] or Fort Jones 
[California] VOR; the pilot responded, in part, "...the VOR is broken or something."
At 1651:16 hours, the R-36 sector controller instructed the pilot to contact the Oakland ARTCC 
sector controller on either 132.2 or 124.85 Mhz frequency.  He also advised the pilot to call him 
back if he was unable to establish two-way communications with the Oakland ARTCC sector 
controller.  The pilot acknowledged the R-36 sector controller's instructions.
At 1651:41 hours, the Seattle R-36 sector controller called the Oakland R-42 sector controller 
and advised him of the lost airplane.  At 1655:43 hours, the Oakland R-42 sector controller 
advised the Seattle R-36 sector controller that the Oakland D-10 sector controller was talking 
Page 4 of 9LAX93LA148
to N91CL.
At 1653:27 hours, the pilot (N91CL) contacted the Seattle D-10 sector controller and reported 
that he was lost and with an inoperative VOR. The D-10 sector controller instructed the pilot to 
squawk transponder code 6640 and asked him if he was in vfr conditions.  The pilot 
responded, "...I'm vfr but I have a layer of clouds below me so I can't see the ground."
At 1654:41 hours, the D-10 sector controller asked the pilot what was his last known position.  
The pilot responded, "It was about Crescent City [California} about fifteen [or] twenty minutes 
ago."  At 1655:04 hours, the pilot stated that he was flying at 10,500 feet msl in response to the 
controller's inquiry.
At 1656:10 hours, the D-10 sector controller instructed the pilot to squawk 7700 [the 
emergency transponder code].  The pilot did not respond.  The D-10 sector controller contacted 
the Oakland ARTCC sector controller and advised him that he lost communications with 
N91CL.  The Oakland sector controller advised the Seattle D-10 sector controller that Oakland 
ARTCC has no traffic information on N91CL.
At 1657:19 hours, America West Flight 54 attempted to contact N91CL, but without success.  At 
1659:03 hours, the Seattle D-10 sector controller asked United Airlines Flight 1473 to attempt 
contact with N91CL.  Flight 1473 called N91CL several times and at 1700:03 hours, the N91CL 
pilot responded, "are you speaking with me?"  The pilot aboard Flight 1473 told N91CL pilot 
that the D-10 sector controller asked them to try and contact him.  N91CL's pilot did not 
respond. Flight 1473 reattempted to contact N91CL several more times, but without success.
At 1701:02 hours, the pilot called the D-10 sector controller; the controller responded, but the 
pilot did not acknowledge the response. At 1701:56 hours, the pilot [N91CL] called the Seattle 
R-30 sector controller twice.  The R-30 sector controller responded, but did not receive a 
response from the pilot.
At 1703:43 hours, the pilot [N91CL] called the D-10 sector controller. Flight 1473 responded 
and instructed the pilot [N91CL] to squawk 7700 Again, the pilot [N91CL] did not respond. The 
sector controller did not receive N91CL's call.
There were no other known communications between N91CL and any other FAA Air Traffic 
Facilities or any other airborne aircraft. In a recorded land line communications at 2201 hours 
between the Seattle and Oakland area managers, the Oakland area manager stated that he 
talked with N91CL's previous owner.  The owner told him that the pilot had only performed 
some high speed taxiing before departing on the accident flight.
The Oakland area manager also stated that one of the Oakland sector controllers had an 
Ameriflight aircraft fly next to N91CL, but the Ameriflight pilot was unable to get N91CL's 
pilot's attention.  The Ameriflight pilot reported that N91CL was flying "in and out of the 
clouds" at 11,000 feet msl. Due to inclement weather at the accident site, the wreckage was not 
found until March 12, 1993.
The accident coordinates are:  40 degrees, 07 minutes north latitude and 123 degrees, 30 
minutes west longitude.
Crew Information
The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with airplane single engine land, multiengine land, 
and instrument - airplane ratings.  The pilot received the airplane - instrument rating on May 
Page 5 of 9LAX93LA148
29, 1992, and the commercial pilot certificate with a multiengine rating on July 5, 1992.  A 
designated airman medical examiner issued the pilot a second- class medical certificate on 
February 10, 1992; the certificate did not contain any limitation endorsements.
Safety Board investigators obtained and examined the pilot's personal flight hours logbook.  
The flight times reflected on page three of this report were obtained from the examination. The 
logbook examination also revealed that the pilot had logged 2.9 hours in the preceding 90 days 
before departing on the accident flight;  the 90 days column on page three includes the 
accident flight.
The pilot's commercial pilot's application form, FAA Form 8710-1, dated July 4, 1992, 
indicated that he flew two airplane's on the commercial pilot's flight test; a Cessna 172 and a 
Cessna 310. Satisfactory completion of the flight test satisfied the biennial flight review 
requirements of the current federal aviation regulations.
The accident airplane's previous owners reported that the pilot had not flown the accident 
airplane before departing on the accident flight. One of the owner's said that they tried to 
dissuade the pilot from flying that day due to the approaching inclement weather.  The pilot 
demurred and elected to depart.
Aircraft Information
The aircraft and engine data reflected on page 2 of the report were obtained from the 
examination of the airframe/engine maintenance logbooks.  The logbooks examination 
revealed that a certificated airframe/powerplant mechanic performed the last annual 
inspection on the airplane on January 4, 1993.  There were no reported deferred maintenance 
discrepancies noted during the examination.
Meteorological Information
The weather data reflected on page 4 of this report was the Redding Airport, Redding, 
California, 1830 hours surface weather observation. Search and rescue personnel reported that 
a search was initiated on March 1, 1993, and was terminated east of the accident area due to 
clouds obscuring the mountainous terrain. The clouds reduced the visibility to about 1/4 mile.
Communications
A review of the communications transcripts between the pilot and the FAA Air Traffic Control 
Facilities, disclosed several communications difficulties.  The two-way communications 
between the pilot and sector controllers were only momentarily established.
The FAA provided the Safety Board with a National Track Analysis Program (NTAP) radar data 
on what is believed to be the accident airplane.  The air traffic control facility provided a radar 
plot on a portion of a sectional chart.  The NTAP data showed that the last transponder target 
on code 7700 occurred at 1744:37.  At this time the airplane's altitude was 11,200 feet msl and 
its coordinates were 40 degrees, 45.34 minutes north latitude and 112 degrees, 27.55 minutes 
west longitude.  The last coordinates were 53 miles northeast of the accident site.
Wreckage and Impact Information
The FAA, Sacramento FSDO, conducted the on scene investigation. The inspectors reported 
that the broken tree branches and the wreckage examination disclosed the airplane's left wing 
struck some trees while on a heading of 320 degrees while in a "steep declining [flight] path." 
After the initial tree impact, the airplane continued about another 90 feet and then struck more 
Page 6 of 9LAX93LA148
trees leaving the entire main gear assembly in the branches about 40 feet above the ground.  
The airplane came to rest at the base of a large girth oak tree trunk;  a section of the tree fell on 
the main fuselage area.  The wreckage was confined "within a 25-foot circle."
All of the airplane's major components and flight controls were found at the main wreckage 
site.  Both wings separated from their respective wing-to-fuselage attach points.  The left wing 
and the airplane's aft section were found folded toward the fuselage; the right wing was found, 
inverted, about 15 feet forward and to the right of the main wreckage. The flight control 
surfaces remained attached at their respective attach points.  The flight controls could not be 
operated by their respective operational mechanisms due to severe impact damage.  All of the 
fractured control cables exhibited extensive overload characteristics.
The engine separated from its firewall attach points, but was found at the main wreckage area.  
The engine did not exhibit any catastrophic internal failures.  The oil tank, carburetor, vacuum 
pump, and a few minor external air ducts separated from the engine accessory section.
The propeller hub assembly remained attached at the engine crankshaft. One propeller blade 
broke into two pieces with the remaining section impacted in the ground.
There was no fire.
Medical and Pathological Information
The Trinity County Coroner's Office, Weaverville, California, conducted the post-mortem 
examination on the pilot.  The pathologist attributed the pilot's death to "multiple traumatic 
injuries."  There was no evidence that the pilot had any condition or disease which would have 
detracted from his ability to fly an aircraft.
The FAA, Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed the 
toxicological examinations for drugs and alcohol.  One of the specimens retained for 
toxicological examinations contained a 0.01% ethanol (alcohol) content and was negative for 
drugs;  the remaining two specimens were negative for ethanol or drugs.
The manager of the Civil Aeromedical Institute's Toxicology and Accident Research Laboratory 
attributed the 0.01% ethanol content to putrefaction.
Additional Information
Neither the Safety Board nor the FAA assumed custody of the wreckage. The FAA inspectors 
left the wreckage at the accident site.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
