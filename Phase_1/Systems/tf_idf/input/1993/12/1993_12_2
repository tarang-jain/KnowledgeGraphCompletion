Accident Number:
DCA94MA022
Date & Time:
12/01/1993, 1950 CST 
Registration:
N334PX

JETSTREAM BA-3100

Destroyed
Defining Event:

18 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Scheduled
Analysis 
WHILE ON A LOCALIZER BACK COURSE APPROACH THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH 
TREES AND THE TERRAIN APRX 3 MI FROM THE RUNWAY THRESHOLD. THE CAPTAIN 
DELAYED THE START OF THE DESCENT THAT SUBSEQUENTLY REQUIRED AN 
EXCESSIVE DESCENT RATE TO REACH THE FAF AND MDH. THE CAPTAIN'S ACTIONS 
LED TO DISTRACTIONS DURING CRITICAL PHASES OF THE APPROACH. THE 
FLIGHTCREW LOST ALTITUDE AWARENESS AND ALLOWED THE AIRPLANE TO 
DESCEND BELOW MANDATORY LEVEL OFF POINTS. THE CAPTAIN'S RECORD RAISED 
QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS AIRMANSHIP AND BEHAVIOR THAT SUGGESTED A LACK OF 
CREW COORDINATION DURING FLIGHT OPERATIONS, INCLUDING INTIMIDATION OF 
FIRST OFFICERS. COMPANY MANAGEMENT DID NOT ADDRESS THESE MATTERS 
ADEQUATELY. THE AIRLINE'S FLIGHT OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT FAILED TO 
IMPLEMENT PROVISIONS TO ADEQUATELY OVERSEE THE TRAINING OF THEIR 
FLIGHTCREWS AND THE OPERATION OF THEIR AIRCRAFT. FAA GUIDANCE TO THEIR 
INSPECTORS CONCERNING IMPLEMENTATION OF OPS BULLETINS IS INADEQUATE 
AND HAS FAILED TO TRANSMIT VALUABLE SAFETY INFORMATION AS INTENDED TO 
AIRLINES. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE CAPTAIN'S ACTIONS THAT LED TO A BREAKDOWN IN CREW COORDINATION AND 
THE LOSS OF ALTITUDE AWARENESS BY THE FLIGHTCREW DURING AN 
UNSTABILIZED APPROACH IN NIGHT INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. 
CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANY 
MANAGEMENT TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED 
DEFICIENCIES IN AIRMANSHIP AND CREW RESOURCE MANAGEMENT OF THE 
CAPTAIN; THE FAILURE OF THE COMPANY TO IDENTIFY AND CORRECT A 
WIDESPREAD, UNAPPROVED PRACTICE DURING INSTRUMENT APPROACH 
PROCEDURES; AND THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION'S INADEQUATE 
SURVEILLANCE AND OVERSIGHT OF THE AIR CARRIER. (NTSB REPORT AAR-94/05)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
