Factual Information
 On Thursday, September 2, 1993, at 1000 eastern daylight time, N7507P, a Piper PA-24-250, 
owned and operated by Donald Doran of Vero Beach, Florida, lost engine power shortly after 
takeoff and collided with the ground in a field at Caribou, Maine.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed.  The certificated commercial pilot and his 
passenger received minor injuries.  The airplane was substantially damaged.  The personal 
flight was being operated  under 14 CFR 91 and was destined for Auburn-Lewiston, Maine.
According to the pilot, he had completed his pretakeoff checks and run-up successfully.  He 
stated that after departing runway 29 at about 200 feet above the ground, the engine lost 
power.  The pilot stated that the fuel selector was on the left tank and that he tried switching 
tanks to restart the engine, but he was unsuccessful.  He made a forced landing in a field about 
a quarter mile from the airport.
According to the FAA Inspector who examined the wreckage,  both auxiliary fuel tanks and the 
left main fuel tank were full and the right main fuel tank was empty.  A witness at the accident 
site stated that he turned the fuel selector off after he smelled fuel, but he does not recall which 
tank the selector was on.  The pilot had reported to the FAA that the tanks were topped off 
about a week prior to the accident, and that he had flown about 2.12 hours since the refuelling.  
The airplane's main tanks capacity is 30 gallons per tank, and the fuel consumption according 
to the FAA is 14.3 gph.
The engine was examined after the accident under the supervision of an FAA inspector.  The 
engine was installed with a test club propeller and a slave carburetor in order to test run the 
engine.  The engine was started and operated without difficulty.  According to the FAA there 
was no evidence of mechanical malfunction that would have prevented the engine from 
operating.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
