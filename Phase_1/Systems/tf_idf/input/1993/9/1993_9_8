Analysis 
THE PILOT AND THREE PASSENGERS WERE ON A LOCAL SIGHTSEEING FLIGHT 
WHEN ON HIS RETURN TO THE AIRPORT, ONE OF THE PASSENGERS IN THE REAR 
SEAT BECAME ILL.  THE PILOT STATED THAT HE EXPEDITED THE APPROACH BY 
REDUCING THE POWER TO IDLE, AND COMMENCING A DESCENT OF ABOUT 1000 
FEET PER MINUTE ON THE DOWNWIND LEG.  HE STATED THAT THE AIRPLANE 
TOUCHED DOWN MIDFIELD AND HE WAS UNABLE TO STOP THE AIRPLANE IN TIME 
TO AVOID THE EMBANKMENT (BERM) AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY. THE AIRPLANE 
STRUCK THE EMBANKMENT AND CAME TO REST ABOUT 60 FEET FROM THE END OF 
THE RUNWAY.  THE PILOT STATED THAT THERE WAS NO MECHANICAL 
MALFUNCTION. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT MISJUDGED HIS AIRSPEED AND ALTITUDE WHICH RESULTED IN THE 
PILOT'S FAILURE TO ATTAIN THE PROPER TOUCHDOWN POINT RESULTNG IN THE 
AIRPLANE EXITING THE RUNWAY AND COLLIDING WITH THE BERM.  A RELATED 
FACTOR WAS THE LOCATION OF THE BERM.

Factual Information
 On Thursday, September 2, 1993, at 1750 eastern daylight time, N2406U, a Piper PA-28-161, 
operated by Air Atlantic Airlines of Centre Hall, Pennsylvania, and piloted by Duane Watkeys 
of Boalsburg, Pennsylvania, sustained substantial damage during landing at Penns Cave 
Airport, Centre Hall, Pennsylvania.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight 
plan was not filed.  The certificated commercial pilot and his three passengers were not 
injured.  The local sightseeing flight was conducted under 14 CFR 91.
According to the pilot, on the downwind leg to runway 25, one of the passengers in the rear 
seat became ill.  He stated that he expedited the approach by reducing the power to idle, 
lowering full flaps, and attaining a rate of descent of about 1000 fpm.  He stated that upon 
flare/touchdown about midfield, the airplane bounced about 3 times.  He reported that when 
the main wheels were firmly on the runway, he applied the brakes, but the airplane exited the 
runway and went down an embankment.  The pilot reported that there was no mechanical 
malfunctions and the accident could have been prevented if he had not expedited the approach 
which resulted in a higher airspeed and higher rate of descent.  He also stated that a timely 
balked landing would have prevented the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
