Factual Information
 On November 2, 1993, at 1000 Alaska standard time, a wheel equipped Aeronca Champ 7DC 
airplane, N2532E, owned and operated by the pilot-in-command, crashed during a go-around 
attempt on runway 07 at Goose Bay, Alaska.  The private certificated pilot and his passenger, 
the sole occupants, were not injured and the airplane sustained substantial damage.  The 
personal pleasure flight, operating under 14 CFR Part 91, last departed the Lake Hood gravel 
strip at approximately 0915 and the destination was Goose Bay.  Visual meteorological 
conditions existed and a visual flight rules flight plan was not in effect.
The pilot-in-command told the NTSB investigator-in-charge during a telephone interview, that 
he was performing his first wheel landing in the airplane.  Upon making contact with the 
runway, the airplane porpoised once and bounced into the air to a height of about 4 feet.  The 
airplane settled back onto the runway, bounced again, and turned about 40 degrees toward the 
left edge of the runway.  He applied power and attempted a go-around but collided with trees 
during the process.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
