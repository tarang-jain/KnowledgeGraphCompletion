The initial portion of the airplane's takeoff on runway 17 was normal. The wind was from 250 
degrees at 15 knots. Just as the airplane lifted off, a crosswind blew it off the left side of the 
runway. The airplane struck a fence and nosed over. The pilot said that it was "likely that a 
wind gust in excess of the aircraft's capability was encountered."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to maintain directional control during takeoff. A contributing factors was the 
gusty crosswind condition.

Factual Information
On April 1, 2001, approximately 1045 mountain daylight time, N679WB, a Fox Pegazair 100, 
owned and operated by the pilot was substantially damaged when it collided with terrain 
during takeoff from Angel Fire, New Mexico, Airport. The commercial pilot, the only occupant 
aboard, was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had 
been filed for the personal flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91. The flight was 
originating at the time of the accident.
In a telephone interview, the pilot said he was making a takeoff on runway 17. Just as the 
airplane lifted off, a crosswind blew it off the left side of the runway. The airplane struck a 
fence and nosed over. At the time of the accident, the wind was from 250 degrees at 15 knots.
In his accident report, the pilot said the initial portion of the takeoff was normal, but after the 
airplane had rolled 520 feet, "directional control was lost and the aircraft departed the runway 
at about a 30 degree angle." The airplane became airborne and continued 524 feet before 
crossing a small ditch and colliding with a barbed wire fence. The airplane traveled another 40 
feet before striking the ground in a right wing low attitude. The right main landing gear 
collapsed and the airplane skidded another 16 feet before nosing over. The pilot said that there 
were gusty crosswinds at the time of the accident and that is was "likely that a wind gust in 
excess of the aircraft's capability was encountered."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
