Factual Information
On April 2, 2001, at 1849 hours Pacific daylight time, a Cessna 172S, N669SP, made a hard 
landing on runway 25L at the Long Beach/Daugherty Field Airport, Long Beach, California.  
The airplane sustained substantial damage after it veered off the right side of the runway and 
struck a taxiway sign with the lower portion of the left wing strut.  The airplane was operated 
by Surface to Air as an instructional flight under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91.  The student 
pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the 
local landing pattern-work flight.  No flight plan had been filed.
The Long Beach/Daugherty Field (LGB) aviation routine weather report (METAR) issued at 
1856 reported: visibility 10 miles with few clouds at 4,000 msl; wind from 160 degrees at 9 
knots; temperature 57 degrees Fahrenheit; dew point 48 degrees Fahrenheit; and altimeter 
29.85 inHg.
A Safety Board investigator interviewed the operator of the airplane.  He stated that this was 
the student pilot's fifth solo.  The pilot had been approved to practice landing pattern work.  On 
the first landing the student landed the airplane hard.  The airplane ballooned and veered to 
the right off the runway, where it struck a taxiway sign.
Repeated unsuccessful attempts were made to obtain airplane and pilot information from both 
the airplane owner and the student pilot.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
