Factual Information
On October 1, 2001, about 1700 mountain daylight time, a Cessna 172, N3910F, was destroyed 
when it collided with terrain near Lindsay, Montana.  The airplane was owned by the pilot, and 
was being operated as a personal/pleasure flight under the provisions of Title 14, CFR Part 91, 
when the accident occurred.  The private pilot, the sole occupant of the airplane, received 
serious injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a visual flight rules (VFR) 
flight plan was filed and activated for the cross-country flight.  The flight originated from 
Glendive, Montana (GDV), approximately 30 minutes prior to the accident.  The pilot's 
planned destination was Helena, (HLN), Montana.  
During a telephone interview with a NTSB investigator on October 1st, the pilot reported that 
he was adjusting the airplane's radio while in a cruise configuration at an altitude of 300 feet 
above ground level (AGL). The pilot reported in a written statement that the communications 
radio on the copilot side was making noise due to airflow from the vent, and he was attempting 
to adjust its position just prior to the accident. He reported that he remembered "pulling up" 
just before the airplane collided with terrain.  The pilot stated that he was unable to recall any 
of the detailed events leading up to the accident. 
The pilot reported in a written statement that prior to the flight, he amended the flight plan 
cruise altitude from 6500 feet to 4500 feet. The pilot reported on the Pilot/Operator Aircraft 
Accident Report Form no mechanical malfunction or failure at the time of the accident. 
The automated weather observation at Glendive, Montana (GDV), at 1655 reported winds from 
160 degrees at 6 knots, 10 statute miles visibility, and clear skies. Glendive is approximately 25 
nautical miles west of the accident site.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
