Factual Information
On November 2, 2001, about 1410 eastern standard time, a Cessna 172D, N36SK, was 
substantially damaged when it impacted terrain near Argyle, New York.  The certificated 
private pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was 
filed for the local personal flight conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
The pilot stated that he took off from runway 21 at Argyle Airport  (1C3), Argyle, New York.  
Shortly after departure, about 150 feet above the ground, the oil access door opened.  The pilot 
decided to return for a landing, and made a left turn back towards the airport.  The pilot added 
that due to strong winds, the airplane "lost lift," and it impacted the ground.  The airplane 
came to rest in an alfalfa field about 1/2 mile from the airport.  The nose gear, propeller, wings, 
and fuselage sustained substantial damage.  The pilot further stated that he did not experience 
any pre-impact mechanical malfunctions with the airplane.  
The reported wind at an airport about 8 miles northwest of the accident site, at 1353, was from 
190 degrees at 14 knots, gusting to 18 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
