Analysis 
The first officer landed the airplane upon completion of a night ILS approach.  Just after

crossing the runway from left to right.  The captain shut down the engine and taxied to the 
gate.  Post-accident examination of the airplane revealed that the engine firewall was cracked, 
one propeller blade was bent, and another blade had separated near the hub.  The separated 
portion of the blade was found about 300 feet from where the collision occurred.  Weather at 
the time included a 600-foot overcast layer.

Factual Information
On November 1, 2001, at 2145 eastern standard time, a Beech 1900C, N210CJ, operating as 
U.S Airways Express flight 5955, was substantially damaged when it collided with a deer while 
landing at Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport (BHB), Bar Harbor, Maine.  The certificated 
airline transport pilot, the first officer, and the 11 passengers were uninjured.  Night 
instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The flight was 
operating on an instrument flight rules flight plan between General Edward Lawrence Logan 
International Airport (BOS), Boston, Massachusetts, and Bar Harbor.  The scheduled 
passenger flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 121.
The flight was operated by Colgan Air, Inc.  According to the Director of Safety, the first officer 
had just completed an ILS RWY 22 approach.  She landed the airplane, and just after 
touchdown, it struck a deer that was crossing from left to right.  The captain took control of the 
airplane and stopped it on the runway.  As the airplane slowed to a stop, the left engine began 
to vibrate.  The captain secured the engine, and after shutdown, noted that one of the 
composite propeller blades was missing.  After assessing the damage, the captain taxied the 
airplane to the ramp, where the passengers deplaned uneventfully.
Post-accident examination of the airplane revealed that the engine firewall was cracked, one 
propeller blade was bent, and another blade had separated near the hub.  The separated 
portion of the blade was found about 300 feet from where the collision occurred.  
Weather at the time included a 600-foot overcast layer.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
