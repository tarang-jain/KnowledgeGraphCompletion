Factual Information
On May 3, 2001, at 2040 hours Pacific daylight time, a Cessna T210N, N6425N, veered off the 
runway while landing on runway 28, and struck a landing light and taxiway sign at the 
Truckee-Tahoe Airport, Truckee, California.  The airplane was operated by the pilot/owner 
under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91, and sustained substantial damage.  The private pilot 
and one passenger were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the 
personal flight that departed Oakland, California, at 1920.  The flight was scheduled to 
terminate at the Truckee-Tahoe Airport.  No flight plan had been filed.
The pilot stated that the airplane landed hard on the first attempt, and the landing was 
aborted.  On the second attempt, the airplane landed hard again, the pilot lost directional 
control, and the horizontal stabilizer was damaged after it struck a landing light and taxiway 
sign.
The Safety Board Investigator-in-Charge (IIC) interviewed a witness to the accident.  The 
witness stated that the airplane made a hard landing and departed the runway where it struck a 
sign, and then it took off again with the sign embedded in the airplane.  The airplane went 
around in the pattern and landed normally.
A Federal Aviation Administration inspector conducted an on-scene investigation.  He 
reported that part of a taxiway sign was embedded in the horizontal stabilizer and compression 
wrinkles were observed on the left side of the airplane near the baggage door.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
