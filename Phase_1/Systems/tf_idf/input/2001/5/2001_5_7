Factual Information
On May 3, 2001, about 1050 Alaska daylight time, a wheel-equipped Piper PA-32-300 airplane, 
N4089W, operated under 14 CFR Part 135 as an on-demand cargo flight by Bellair, Inc., 
received substantial damage while landing at the Chefornak Airport, Chefornak, Alaska.  The 
solo commercial-certificated pilot was not injured. The  flight operated in visual meteorological 
conditions, and a VFR and company flight plan were in effect.  The flight departed Bethel, 
Alaska, about 1000, en route to Chefornak.
During a telephone interview with the NTSB investigator-in-charge on May 3, the pilot of the 
accident airplane related that he departed Bethel with 1,000 pounds of U.S. mail for 
Chefornak.  It was his intent to deposit the mail at Chefornak, and return to Bethel.  He said 
the flight to Chefornak was uneventful.  He elected to land on runway 34, and noted the surface  
wind  was nearly a direct crosswind from the west, at 10-15 miles per hour.  As he approached 
the landing threshold, he said his indicated airspeed was about 80 miles per hour, when the 
airplane suddenly stalled, landed hard, and bounced off the right side of the runway.  The pilot 
said the airplane received substantial damage to the right wing and fuselage.  He also said there 
were no preimpact mechanical problems with the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
