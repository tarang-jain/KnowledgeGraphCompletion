Factual Information
On June 1, 2001, approximately 1400 mountain daylight time, a Cessna TR182, N4602S, 
registered to Leeward Winery and operated by the private pilot as a 14 CFR Part 91 personal 
flight, collided with a runway light during the landing roll at Boise Air Terminal (Gowen Field), 
Boise, Idaho.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and a visual flight rules 
flight plan was filed.  The aircraft was substantially damaged and the private pilot and his 
passenger were not injured.  The flight departed from Concord, California, about 1115.  
The pilot reported to a Federal Aviation Administration Inspector from the Boise Flight 
Standards District Office and in a subsequent written statement, that during the landing roll 
with a 90 degree crosswind on runway 28L, the aircraft encountered a gust of wind.  The 
aircraft veered to the side of the runway and the right wing contacted a runway edge light, and 
the propeller contacted the ground.  Maintenance personnel performing repairs on the aircraft 
reported that the former tip rib on the right wing was damaged, and approximately 12 to 16 
inches of leading edge wing skin, requiring an additional seam, was spliced in.  
At 1406,  the Boise airport was reporting winds from 180 degrees at nine knots, gusting to 16 
knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
