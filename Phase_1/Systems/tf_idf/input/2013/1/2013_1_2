Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
After the private pilot and flight instructor conducted a low pass over a snow-covered runway, 
the private pilot proposed returning to their home airport. However, the flight instructor 
elected to demonstrate a soft field touch-and-go landing on the snow-covered runway before 
the return flight. When the airplane touched down, the snow was deeper than the flight 
instructor anticipated, and the airplane slowed faster than he expected. The pilots added full 
power and increased back pressure on the control yoke; however, the airplane pitched forward 
on its nosewheel and then rolled right and left, striking both wings and substantially damaging 
both main wing spars. The pilots reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures 
with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor™s failure to maintain airplane control during a landing on a snow-covered 
runway.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=85920
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
