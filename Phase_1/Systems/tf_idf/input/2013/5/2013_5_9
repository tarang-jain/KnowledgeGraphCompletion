Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Hamilton, MT
Accident Number:
WPR13CA253
Date & Time:
05/01/2013, 0830 MDT 
Registration:
N322MH
Aircraft:
SCHWEIZER 300C
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Hard landing
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The flight instructor reported that during an instructional flight, the helicopter was 500 feet 
above ground level when he rolled the throttle off with the intent for the student to respond by 
initiating a straight-in autorotation. The student pilot did not respond properly, so the 
instructor took the controls to initiate a power recovery. The helicopter subsequently landed 
hard, deforming both skids and substantially damaging the airframe. The pilot did not report 
any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter that would have 
precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot™s failure to maintain helicopter control during a practice autorotation and the 
flight instructor's delayed remedial action.
Findings
Aircraft
Descent rate - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Delayed action - Instructor/check pilot (Cause)
Aircraft control - Student pilot (Cause)

Note:

to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=87040
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
