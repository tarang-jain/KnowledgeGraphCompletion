Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Boise, ID
Accident Number:
WPR13LA111
Date & Time:
02/02/2013, 1924 MST 
Registration:
N8465L
Aircraft:
CESSNA T210L
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Abnormal runway contact
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Other Work Use
Analysis 
The pilot had been with the company about 2 weeks, and a pilot-rated passenger was on board 
the airplane to instruct the pilot on the use of the equipment associated with aerial survey 
work. The pilot had not previously flown this make/model airplane, so the passenger was also 
facilitating the pilot™s understanding of the airplane and its individual characteristics. The pilot 
completed about 3 hours of survey work and then proceeded to the airport for an instrument 
landing system approach. The pilot reported that, as the airplane neared the decision height, 
he observed lights on the ground, which he believed were part of the airport environment, so 
he continued the approach. When he subsequently determined that the approach was unstable, 
it was too late to execute a missed approach, and he landed the airplane short of the runway. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. The pilot and passenger safely 
exited the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain a proper glidepath and stabilized approach, which resulted in the 
airplane touching down short of the runway.
Findings
Aircraft
Descent/approach/glide path - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Incorrect action performance - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Runway/taxi/approach light - Effect on personnel

Factual Information
On February 2, 2013, about 1924 mountain standard time, a Cessna T210L, N8465L, collided 
with terrain at Boise Air Terminal, Boise, Idaho. Mat-Tech Engineering LLC was operating the 
airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The commercial 
pilot and one pilot-rated passenger sustained minor injuries; the airplane sustained substantial 
damage to the fuselage from impact forces. The cross-country aerial survey flight departed 
Twin Falls, Idaho, about 1530, with a planned destination of Boise. Instrument meteorological 
conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed.
The pilot had been with the company about 2 weeks, and the passenger was on board to 
instruct the pilot on the use of the equipment associated with aerial survey work. The pilot had 
not flown this airplane so the passenger was also facilitating understanding of the airplane and 
its individual characteristics.
The pilot reported that the airplane had a full tank of fuel at departure, and the plan was to 
complete 3.5 hours of survey work; the work took about 3 hours. The pilot-rated passenger was 
to perform the radio calls. In addition to the automated terminal information system airport 
weather, the pilot asked approach control about the conditions at the airport. The pilot had 
apprehension about the weather, but proceeded to Boise for lack of a more suitable airport 
nearby that reported weather.
The pilot reported that he received an IFR clearance, and was on an instrument landing system 
approach to runway 10R. As he neared decision height, he observed a light, which he believed 
was part of the airport environment, so he continued the approach. However, when he 
determined that the approach was unstable, it was too late to execute a missed approach, and 
the landing was short of the runway. The pilot and passenger exited the airplane safely under 
their own power.
The pilot did not complete the National Transportation Safety Board Pilot/Operator Aircraft 
Accident/Incident Report Form 6120.1.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
