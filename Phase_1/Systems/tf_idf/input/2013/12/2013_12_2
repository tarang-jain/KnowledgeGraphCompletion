Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The student pilot reported that following an uneventful flight, as he entered the airport traffic 
pattern on the downwind leg, was notified by another pilot that there was an airplane operating 
within the traffic pattern with no radio. The student pilot established visual contact with one 
airplane, however, did not establish visual contact with the airplane operating without a radio 
until reaching the mid-field point on downwind. The student pilot stated that throughout the 
approach to landing, he maintained visual contact with the airplane until it would not be a 
factor. The student pilot subsequently landed the airplane with the landing gear in the 
retracted position, which resulted in structural damage to the fuselage. The student pilot stated 
that his attention was diverted between maintaining airspeed and a stable approach to the 
runway, while maintaining visual contact with the airplane that was not in radio contact. He 
added that he failed to do his before landing checklist as he normally does at the mid-field 
point on downwind and each turn in the traffic pattern. The pilot reported no preaccident 
mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal 
operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to extend the landing gear prior to landing. Contributing to the accident was 
the pilot's diverted attention and not using a checklist.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
