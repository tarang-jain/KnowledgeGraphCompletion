Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Crescent City, FL
Accident Number:
ERA14CA061
Date & Time:
12/03/2013, 0937 EST 
Registration:
N71DF
Aircraft:
AERO COMMANDER 680E
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
4 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that the airplane "hesitated" during the takeoff roll due to the added weight 
of the passengers on board and the grass surface of the departure airstrip. He said he then 
added "extra" engine power at rotation, and that the left engine accelerated more quickly than 
the right, which resulted in an adverse yaw to the right and collision with trees along the right 
side of the runway. The subsequent collision with trees and terrain resulted in substantial 
damage to the airframe. According to the pilot, there were no mechanical deficiencies with the 
airplane that would have prevented normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during takeoff.
Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
