Registration:
N581TC
Aircraft:
ANDERSON ANDREAS RANS S-6S
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
VFR encounter with IMC
Injuries:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
According to the pilot, he departed the Nashville, Tennessee area earlier in the day and was en 
route to his destination of Greenville, South Carolina at 9500 feet above mean sea level (msl). 
He stated that he checked the automated surface observing systems weather report and that 
the clouds in the Morristown, Tennessee area were reported to be at 7,000 feet above ground 
level. He added that he knew that he would be able to clear the mountains just below the 
recorded ceiling height when needed. The pilot was operating under the provisions of day 
visual flight rules (VFR) on top of the broken/overcast cloud layer prior to beginning the 
descent through the clouds. During the descent, the pilot stated that the ceiling appeared lower 
than reported and he elected to climb back up to VFR on top. During this process, the pilot 
became disoriented, hit a tree, and impacted the side of a mountain. Examination of the 
airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed substantial damage to the 
fuselage, wings, and empennage. The recorded ceiling and visibility at Greenville Downtown 
Airport, Greenville, South Carolina, about 10 nautical miles to the southeast of the accident site 
was an overcast ceiling at 800 feet msl and the visibility was 9 statute miles. The pilot reported 
that there were no pre-impact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to continue visual flight into deteriorating weather, which resulted in an 
encounter with instrument meteorological conditions and subsequent inability to maintain 
clearance with terrain.

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=88509
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
