Aircraft:
BEECH P35

Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel starvation

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The pilot and flight instructor were making touch-and-go landings when the engine lost power. 
Unable to glide to the runway, they made a forced landing in an open field. During the forced 
landing, the landing gear was sheared off and the firewall was buckled. The student sustained a 
serious injury and the flight instructor received minor injuries. A Federal Aviation 
Administration inspector examined the airplane and reported the fuel selector was positioned 
on the left fuel tank. When electrical power was applied, the left fuel gauge registered empty. 
No fuel was observed in the left fuel tank. The right fuel tank had not been compromised and 
contained fuel.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of both the flight instructor and the pilot to monitor and manage the fuel on board, 
which resulted in an engine failure due to fuel starvation.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=87368
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
