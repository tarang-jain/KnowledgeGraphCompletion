Analysis   
The pilot reported that he was practicing touch and go landings in the tail wheel equipped 
amateur-built airplane. During the landing, the airplane became "squirrely" and the pilot 
increased throttle in an effort to straighten the track on the runway. The airplane became 
airborne, however, did not have sufficient power to continue the takeoff climb. The airplane 
subsequently traveled off the runway and nosed over in a field. The underside of the fuselage 
and the rudder were substantially damaged. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control during landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
