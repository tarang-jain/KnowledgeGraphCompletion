ROBINSON R22 - BETA

Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The student pilot stated they had been practicing hovering for about 30 minutes, and were 
about two feet above the ground. He recalled that he was "controlling the cyclic and maybe the 
collective, but not the pedals." The flight instructor thought they were three to five feet above 
the ground. The helicopter experienced a pendular motion and began traveling backwards and 
to the right. The right skid made contact with the ground, which resulted in the tail impacting 
the ground and the helicopter rolling onto its side. The helicopter sustained substantial 
damage to the tail rotor.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's failure to take remedial action in a timely manner.
Findings

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=88293
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
