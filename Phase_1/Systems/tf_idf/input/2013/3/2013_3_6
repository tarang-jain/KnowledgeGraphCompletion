Analysis   
While waiting in the run-up area to taxi onto the runway, the pilot of the Cessna heard a loud 
noise and felt his airplane move. He shut down the engine and, after getting out of the airplane, 
he observed that the left wing of a Piper had collided with the left side of the Cessna™s rudder 
and vertical stabilizer, tipping the vertical stabilizer to the right and twisting and buckling the 
fuselage. The pilot of the Piper reported that, while he was taxiing to get fuel with no intent for 
flight, he saw the tail of the Cessna directly in front of him. He applied right brake action and 
swiveled his airplane to avoid directly hitting the Cessna with the propeller. The pilot added 
that he had no idea why he was unable to see the Cessna in time to avoid the collision.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the pilot of another airplane, who was taxiing with no intent for flight, to 
maintain proper visual lookout.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
