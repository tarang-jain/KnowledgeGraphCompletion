Analysis   
The pilot of the amphibian airplane reported that she was flying a visual approach to a lake, 
over mountainous terrain. On an approximate 3/4 mile final approach to the lake, she 
observed a boat near her intended landing area and performed a go-around to circle for 
another approach. During the go-around and turn, the pilot did not move the throttle lever to 
full power. About one-fourth through the turn, she noticed the airplane was descending and 
increased engine power. The airplane continued to descend and she increased engine power a 
second time; however, one of the airplane's floats contacted a tree and the airplane impacted 
the ground. The pilot further stated that the accident could have been prevented if she had 
flown a higher approach and increased the throttle to full engine power immediately during the 
go-around. Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector 
revealed substantial damage to the wings and the fuselage. The pilot reported no preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions with the airplane and the inspector did not observe any.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to set the engine throttle to full power during a go-around.
Findings
Aircraft
Power lever - Incorrect use/operation (Cause)

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=87695
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
