Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Spearfish, SD
Accident Number:
CEN13LA220
Date & Time:
04/04/2013, 1640 MDT 
Registration:
N525PW
Aircraft:
Walker Phil RV-6A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
While climbing through 6,000 feet, the engine suddenly lost power. The pilot stated that, 
although he subsequently switched on the auxiliary fuel pump and ignition system, the engine 
did not restart; therefore, he executed a forced landing to a nearby pasture. The nose landing 
gear collapsed during the landing, and the airplane came to rest inverted. Examination of the 
automotive engine, which had been adapted for aviation use, found that the coil-distributor 
wire had loosened and was not connected to the coil. It is likely that the wire came loose during 
flight, which rendered the automotive ignition system inoperative and caused the engine to 
lose power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The coil-distributor wire loosening in flight, which rendered the ignition system inoperative 
and subsequently caused the loss of engine power.
Findings
Aircraft
Dist (ignition harness) - Not specified (Cause)
Power plant - Failure (Cause)

Factual Information
On April 4, 2013, about 1640 mountain daylight time, an RV-6A airplane, N525PW, 
experienced a loss of engine power and conducted a forced landing near Spearfish, South 
Dakota. The private rated pilot and flight instructor received minor injuries and the airplane 
was substantially damaged. The airplane was registered to and operated by a private individual 
under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that operated without a flight plan. The flight 
originated from the Black Hills Airport Œ Clyde Ice Field, Spearfish, South Dakota, about 1630.
According to the pilot, he had recently purchased the airplane and was flying the airplane back 
to his home airfield.  After stopping at an en route airport for fuel, they departed, and were 
climbing through 6,000 feet when the engine suddenly lost power. The pilot added that he 
switched on the auxiliary fuel pump and ignition system; however, the engine did not restart.   
He then selected a pasture for the forced landing.  During landing, the nose gear collapsed and 
the airplane came to rest inverted.
The responding Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector examined the airplane on 
site and noted that the airplane™s fuselage and vertical stabilizer sustained substantial damage 
during the accident.  The airplane was equipped with an automotive Chevrolet 4.6L engine 
adapted for aviation use.   Further examination of the engine revealed that the carburetor™s air 
filter was dirty and partly clogged.  Additionally, a wire that runs from the coil to the 
distributor was found disconnected from the coil terminal. The wire and distributor were the 
automotive type and had the traditional terminal male/female plug arrangement, without an 
additional locking mechanism.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
