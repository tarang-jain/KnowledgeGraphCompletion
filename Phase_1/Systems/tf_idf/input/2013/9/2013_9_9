Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The student pilot reported his glider was about one mile from his destination airport and 
thought he had enough altitude to make the field, but then he encountered a sink rate. He 
realized that he would not be able to clear power lines at the edge of the runway so the student 
pilot decided to make an off field landing in a large open field bordered by several obstructions. 
During the landing the right wing struck a small tree when the glider was still several feet 
above ground. The glider landed abruptly and the impact resulted in substantial damage to the 
right wing. The student pilot added that the accident could have been prevented if he had 
earlier recognized the need to land out and if he had prepared for the event at a higher altitude.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's inadequate compensation for landing area conditions during an off-airport 
landing which resulted in a collision with an obstruction.
Findings
Personnel issues
Delayed action - Student pilot (Cause)
Monitoring environment - Student pilot (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
