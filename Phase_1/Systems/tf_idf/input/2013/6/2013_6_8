Substantial
Defining Event:
Abnormal runway contact

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that he had flown into the airport previously, but never in the accident 
airplane. While on final approach, he noticed power lines between his position and the runway, 
and he "pulled back" on the pitch control to overfly the power lines. The pilot continued the 
approach and landing, but in the flare, the airplane "dropped and bounced." When the airplane 
was airborne after the bounce, he added power to initiate a go-around. However, the airplane 
did not climb as expected, and he was experiencing directional control problems. The pilot 
reduced power, and landed the airplane in a field adjacent to the runway. During the rollout in 
the field, the pilot noticed a ditch ahead of him, perpendicular to his direction of travel, and 
about 5 to 10 feet wide. He added power to attempt to fly over the ditch, but the main gear 
struck the far side of the ditch, which damaged the landing gear and fuselage structure. The 
airplane came to rest about two to three airplane lengths beyond the ditch. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage to the lower fuselage, right wing, and empennage, including the 
rudder control system. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures 
with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
