Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Hamlin, TX
Accident Number:
CEN13LA323
Date & Time:
06/01/2013, 1030 CDT 
Registration:
N4946X
Aircraft:
ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL S-2R
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
During the landing, the airplane encountered a strong, gusting right crosswind. The pilot 
attempted to perform a go-around; however, the airplane ground-looped. The prevailing wind 
resulted in a right quartering tailwind with a gusting crosswind component of 23 knots. The 
maximum crosswind velocity for the accident airplane was 15 miles per hour; therefore, the 
calculated crosswind component exceeded the capability of the airplane. The pilot should not 
have landed with a crosswind that exceeded the airplane's capabilities. The pilot reported no 
preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded 
normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to land the airplane with a crosswind that exceeded the airplane's 
capabilities.
Findings
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Crosswind - Effect on operation

Factual Information
On June 1, 2013, about 1030 central daylight time, a Rockwell International S-2R airplane, 
N4946X, impacted terrain while landing at the Hamlin Municipal Airport (14F), Hamlin, 
Texas. The commercial pilot sustained minor injuries. The airplane sustained substantial 
damage. The airplane was registered to and operated by Tri-County Sprayers, Inc., under the 
provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 as an aerial application flight. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was operated without a flight plan. 
The flight originated from 14F at 0925.
According to the pilot, during the landing to runway 34 (3,200 feet by 50 feet, asphalt), the 
airplane encountered a "strong and gusty" crosswind from the right. The pilot attempted to 
perform a go around; however, the airplane groundlooped resulting in substantial damage to 
both wings, the empennage, and the firewall. The pilot reported that the wind was 090 degrees 
at 23 knots, gusting to 28 knots. The closest official weather station, located 28 miles to the 
southwest of 14F, recorded the wind as 100 degrees at 12 knots, gusting to 18 knots. The 
maximum crosswind was calculated to be 23 knots based upon the reported winds from the 
pilot. The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
