Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
FARGO, ND
Accident Number:
CHI98LA001
Date & Time:
10/01/1997, 0830 CDT 
Registration:
N5168A
Aircraft:
Cessna T210N
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot extended the landing gear 3 to 4 miles prior to landing.  During the landing flare the 
landing gear warning horn sounded.  The pilot reported that it was too late to initiate a go-
around so he continued the landing during which the landing gear collapsed.  Postaccident 
testing of the landing gear system revealed the hydraulic pump circuit breaker would pop when 
the landing gear was extended.  This resulted in the gear being in a trailing unlocked position. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the circuit breaker for the hydraulic pump popped during gear extension which resulting in the 
failure of the landing gear to lock in the extended position.

Factual Information
 On October 1, 1997, at 0830 central daylight time, a Cessna T210N, N5168A, operated by a 
commercial pilot collided with the terrain when the landing gear collapsed on touchdown.  The 
landing was being made on runway 17 at the Hector International Airport, Fargo, North 
Dakota.  The 14 CFR Part 91 flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions without a 
flight plan.  The pilot was not injured.  The airplane was substantially damaged.  The flight 
originated from a private airstrip in Hillsboro, North Dakota, at 0800.
The pilot reported he extended the landing gear 3 to 4 miles prior to touchdown at an airspeed 
of 120 knots.  He reported that he kept his hand on the gear lever until it was down at which 
time he made a visual check to assure it was down.  He reported that during the landing flare 
he heard the gear warning horn; however, it was too late to initiate a go-around.  The landing 
gear collapsed as the airplane touched down.
Post accident testing of the landing gear system revealed the hydraulic pump circuit breaker 
would pop when the landing gear was extended leaving the gear in a trailing unlocked position.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
