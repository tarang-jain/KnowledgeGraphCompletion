Location:
ORLANDO, FL
Accident Number:
MIA97LA079
Date & Time:
02/01/1997, 1400 EST 
Registration:
N599T
Aircraft:
Beech V35
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor (CFI) and private pilot had reviewed airwork, turns, stalls, slow flight, take 
off and landings. They elected to practice procedures for a simulated engine failure. According 
to the CFI, 'on go-around, engine failed to produce power, resulting in forced landing....'  The 
FAA inspector stated that during the approach, they were at a fast landing speed and high on 
the approach. At an altitude of about 100 feet above the ground, they attempted to go around 
and advanced the throttle, but the engine did not respond. Subsequently, during the forced 
landing, the airplane collided with a tree. The engine was removed from the airframe, and a 
test run was conducted under the supervision of the FAA. The engine run revealed no 
discrepancies. The private pilot did not submit a statement to explain her account of the 
events. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
loss of engine power for undetermined reason(s).  Trees in the emergency landing area were a 
related factor.

Factual Information
 On February 1, 1997, about 1400 eastern standard time, a Beech V35, N599T, registered 
to a private owner, was substantially damaged while on approach, near Orlando, Florida.  The 
airline transport-rated pilot, certified flight instructor (CFI), and a private pilot were not 
injured.  Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed in the vicinity, and no flight plan 
had been filed.  The local training flight originated at 1300, and was being conducted in 
accordance with Title 14 CFR Part 91.
According to the CFI's statement he and the private pilot had reviewed "airwork, turns, 
stalls, slow flight, take off and landings."  On the accident landing he said, "...conducting 
simulated engine failure...on go-around, engine failed to produce power, resulting in forced 
landing...."
The FAA inspector stated that on this approach they were at a "fast" landing speed, and 
"high" on the approach.  At an altitude of about 100 feet above the ground they attempted to go 
around, advanced the throttle, and landed in a tree.
The engine was removed from the airframe and shipped to Continental Motor's 
facilities, in Mobile, Alabama, where an engine test run was conducted under the supervision of 
the FAA, on March 16, 1997.   The engine run revealed no discrepancies.
The first pilot did not submit a statement pertaining to the facts in this accident, and her 
account of the events of the accident are not known.  According to the FAA they made several 
attempts to contact the pilot and were unsuccessful.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
