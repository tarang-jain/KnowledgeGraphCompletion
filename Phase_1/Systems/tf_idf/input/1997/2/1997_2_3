1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that during the landing roll, the airplane veered to the right. He stated he 
was unable to correct the direction of travel. The airplane continued off the right side of the 
runway and into a 5 to 6 foot deep ditch located approximtely 30 feet from the edge of the 
runway. Postaccident inspection of the brake system failed to reveal any mechanical 
failure/malfunction. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane.  A factor relating to the 
accident was: the ditch, which the airplane contacted.

Factual Information
 On February 1, 1997, at 1115 central standard time, a Cessna 182, N2898R, operated by a 
private pilot collided with a ditch following a loss of directional control while landing on 
runway 16 at the El Dorado Thomas Airport, El Dorado, Kansas.  The 14 CFR Part 91 personal 
flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions without a flight plan.  The airplane was 
substantially damaged and the pilot was not injured.  The flight originated from Ponca City, 
Oklahoma, at 1035 cst.
The pilot reported that after touching down on runway 16 the airplane began to veer to the 
right side of the runway.  He reported that he was unable to straighten the direction of travel.  
The right main landing gear traveled off the side of the runway into soft terrain.  The pilot 
reported that it seemed as if the right wheel was sliding and that this action pulled the airplane 
even more to the right.  The airplane traveled into a ditch located approximately 30 feet off the 
side of the runway.  The ditch was described as being 5 to 6 feet deep.  The pilot reported the 
airplane heading was almost perpendicular with the ditch when it contacted it.
The airplane was removed from the ditch by an A&P/IA.  He stated that the wheels turned 
smoothly with no binding noted as the airplane was moved.  The A&P/IA further inspected the 
brake system and reported he was unable to find any mechanical discrepancies which would 
have resulted in the loss of directional control.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
