Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
INTRACOASTL CTY, LA
Accident Number:
FTW97FA208B
Date & Time:
06/01/1997, 1125 CDT 
Registration:
N2773A
Aircraft:
Bell 206L-1
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Positioning
Analysis 
N115AL, a Bell 206B helicopter, and N2773A, a Bell 206L-1 helicopter, collided in midair 
approximately 3 nm west of Intracoastal City, Louisiana.  N2773A was in cruise flight, 
transiting through the Intracoastal City traffic advisory area from northeast to southwest.  
N115AL departed Intracoastal City westbound.  Radar data indicated that the angle between 
the flight paths was about 60 degrees.  The pilot of N115AL reported that he had just leveled 
out at 700 feet agl when he saw N2773A to his right at a 'slightly' lower altitude and banked 
hard left.  A witness and physical evidence indicated that the main rotor blades of N115AL 
struck the tail rotor of N2773A.  N2773A was not observed to take evasive action.  
Subsequently, N2773A impacted the ground in an uncontrolled descent, and N115AL made a 
forced landing in a slough and sank.  Prior to departure, the pilot of N115AL communicated his 
intentions on the local traffic advisory frequency.  There were no radio communications from 
N2773A on the advisory frequency, and the operator of N2773A did not include the use of 
traffic advisory services as a company standard operating procedure in its operations manual. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of both pilots to see and avoid each other's aircraft.  Factors were the failure of the 
pilot of N2773A to use the available traffic advisory service and the failure of the operator of 
N2773A to make the use of traffic advisory services a company standard operating procedure.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
