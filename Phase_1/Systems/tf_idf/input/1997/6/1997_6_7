Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot departed on a local flight.  While over flying his farm, he decided to land on 
the farm's 1,600 foot grass strip.  The pilot stated the wind sock was pointing straight down the 
runway and he executed a soft field landing.  Immediately after the main gear touched down, 
the airplane began to veer right.  The right wing struck trees, and bent upward.  The airplane 
spun around 180 degrees, and was thrown backward.  The left wing also impacted trees. The 
pilot reported that the right brake had grabbed after landing, which caused the airplane to veer 
into the trees. Examination of the aircraft on site, could not confirm that the right brake had 
grabbed. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control, which resulted in the airplane veering right, 
and striking trees.

Factual Information
 On June 1, 1997, about 1600 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 150, N22935, was 
substantially damaged during landing to a  private grass strip in Elkton, Maryland.  The 
certificated private pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no 
flight plan had been filed for the personal flight conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
According to the pilot, he departed on a local flight from Summit Airport, Middletown, 
Delaware.  While over flying his farm, he decided to land on the farm's 1,600 foot grass strip.  
The pilot stated the wind sock was pointing straight down the runway, and he executed a soft 
field landing with the stall warning horn being heard intermittently.  Immediately after the 
main gear touched down, the airplane began to veer right.  The right wing struck trees, and 
bent upward.  The airplane spun around 180 degrees, and was thrown backward.  The left wing 
also impacted  trees.  
The pilot reported that the right brake had grabbed after landing, which caused the 
airplane to veer into the trees.
Examination of the brake system by a Federal Aviation Administration Inspector could 
not confirm that the right brake had grabbed.  It was noted that 72.2 hours had elapsed since 
the brake discs had been replaced with new discs on October 1, 1995.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
