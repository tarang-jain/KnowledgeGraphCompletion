The pilot reported to the operator that the engine experienced a loss of power during the return 
leg of a cross-country flight.  A forced landing was made on an open field.  During the landing 
roll, the airplane collided with a fence. Inspection of the fuel tanks revealed that the left fuel 
tank was empty, and no fuel was produced when sumped.  The right fuel tank contained 
approximately 1/8 of an inch of fuel, and produced approximately eight ounces of fuel when 
sumped.  No fuel was added during the course of the cross-country flight.

Factual Information
 On November 1, 1997, at 1833 Pacific standard time, a Cessna 152, N5190B, operated by Aerial 
Communications of America as a 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight, collided with a fence during a 
forced landing in a field located 14 miles northwest of Eugene, Oregon.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed.  The aircraft was substantially 
damaged and the private pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured.  The flight originated from 
Eugene at about 1400 and was destined for Elma, Washington.  The flight was returning from 
Elma to Eugene, when the accident occurred.
The pilot reported to the operator that the engine experienced a loss of power.  A forced 
landing was made on an open field.  During the landing roll, the airplane collided with a fence.
Personnel from the airport, who helped recover the aircraft, reported that the tachometer 
indicated that 4.0 hours had been accumulated, and the Hobbs meter indicated that a total of 
4.4 hours had been accumulated for the flight.  The fuel tanks and sumps were inspected to 
determine the quantity of fuel remaining in the tanks.  It was reported that there was no visible 
sign of fuel in the left fuel tank, and no fuel was produced when sumped.  The right fuel tank 
contained approximately 1/8 of an inch of fuel, and produced approximately eight ounces of 
fuel when sumped.  The engine sump produced approximately 14 ounces of fuel.
Fueling records indicate that the aircraft was last fueled on October 31, 1997.
The structural damage was not reported to the National Transportation Safety Board until 
January 27, 1998.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
