CHI97LA241
Date & Time:
08/01/1997, 2045 EDT 
Registration:
N8237R
Aircraft:
Bellanca 17-30A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot said that he had departed with a main fuel tank selected to feed the engine.  Once the 
airplane got above '4,500 feet,' the pilot switched to an auxiliary fuel tank.  'Fuel usage was 
timed using a countdown clock for each tank.  Approaching Lansing, [Michigan] I requested 
and got flight following to Detroit.  A few minutes later, my fuel countdown clock signaled time 
for a fuel cell change.'  The pilot switched to a full tank.  At that time, the engine lost power.  
The pilot switched to another full tank, but the engine wound not start.  'I told Lansing 
Approach of my problem; they gave me the direction to the nearest airport, and I did the 
Bellanca Viking restart procedure.  The plane would not restart.'  The pilot declared an 
emergency and force landed the airplane in a cornfield.  Examination of the wreckage revealed 
that one of the airplane's five fuel tanks was empty.  The remaining fuel tanks were full of fuel. 
No other anomalies were revealed with the airplane. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's inaccurate fuel consumption calculations, his decision to switch fuel tanks too late, 
and fuel starvation.

Factual Information
 On August 1, 1997, at 2045 eastern daylight time (edt), a Bellanca 17-30A, N8237R, operated 
by a private pilot, sustained substantial damage when during cruise flight, the airplane's engine 
lost power.  During the subsequent forced landing, the airplane impacted the terrain.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The flight was being conducted 
under 14 CFR Part 91.  No flight plan was on file.  The pilot reported no injuries.  The flight 
originated at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, at 1800 central daylight time (cdt), and was en route to 
Detroit, Michigan.
In his written statement, the pilot said that he had departed with a main fuel tank selected to 
feed the engine.  Once the airplane got above "4,500 feet," the pilot switched to an auxiliary 
fuel tank.  "Fuel usage was timed using a countdown clock for each tank.  Approaching 
Lansing, [Michigan] I requested and got flight following to Detroit.  A few minutes later, my 
fuel countdown clock signaled time for a fuel cell change."  The pilot switched to a full tank.  At 
that time, the engine lost power.  The pilot switched to another full tank, but the engine would 
not start.  "I told Lansing Approach of my problem; they gave me the direction to the nearest 
airport, and I did the Bellanca Viking restart procedure.  The plane would not restart." The 
pilot declared an emergency and force landed the airplane in a cornfield.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector who examined the wreckage found the 
airplane's engine and cowling bent upward and aft.  The nose gear was separated from the 
airplane.  The engine mounts were bent upward and aft.  There was a large gouge in the leading 
edge of the left wing running aft to the forward spar.  The left wing spar was bent aft.  Flight 
control continuity was confirmed.  One of the airplane's five fuel tanks was empty.  The 
remaining fuel tanks were full of fuel.  Examination of the engine, engine controls and other 
airplane systems revealed no anomalies.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
