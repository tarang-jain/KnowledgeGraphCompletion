Factual Information
 On March 1, 1997, at 1155 mountain standard time, a Cessna TR182, N2396S, sustained 
substantial damage when the nose gear failed to extend for landing at Pueblo Municipal 
Airport, Pueblo, Colorado.  The private pilot and passenger were not injured on this personal 
flight operating under 14 CFR Part 91.  No flight plan was filed and visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed.  The flight departed Alamosa, Colorado, at 1115.
This was the first flight after repairing the nose landing gear following a ground incident which 
occurred on February 21, 1997.  The flight departed Alamosa with the pilot occupying the left 
seat and his 2 year old daughter in a car seat strapped in the right seat.  On arrival in Pueblo, 
the nose gear failed to extend.  After attempts to lower the gear failed, the pilot elected to raise 
the landing gear and landed with all the landing gear in the up position.
Examination of the aircraft by a certified repair station following the accident revealed the nose 
gear doors were not properly adjusted when maintenance was performed on the landing gear 
following the previous incident.  The lack of proper adjustment prevented the nose landing 
gear from extending.  Aircraft damage was to the left wing and underside of the fuselage in the 
area of the nose landing gear assembly.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
