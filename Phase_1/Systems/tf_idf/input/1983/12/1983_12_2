Analysis 
EARLIER IN THE DAY, AN ANNUAL INSPECTION HAD BEEN COMPLETED. THERE 
WERE NO REFUELING FACILITIES ON THE ARPT, SO THE PLT/MECHANIC DROVE TO 
ANOTHER LOCATION & PURCHASED A CAN OF GASOLINE (6 GALS) WHICH HE ADDED 
TO THE TANKS. HE THEN STARTED THE ENG & SATISFACTORILY COMPLETED A TEST 
FLT. AT ABOUT 1425 EST, A POTENTIAL BUYER WAS BOARDED & A DEMONSTRATION 
FLT WAS BEGUN. DURING THE INITIAL CLIMB, AT ABOUT 300 FT AGL, THE ENG 
BEGAN SPUTTERING. THE PLT TRIED TO RETURN TO THE RWY, BUT THE ENG LOST 
ALL POWER. DURING A FORCED LANDING, THE ACFT COLLIDED WITH A FENCE. THE 
FUEL SYS WAS CHECKED & APPEARED TO OPERATE NORMALLY. NOTHING WAS 
FOUND IN THE GASCOLATOR OR FUEL SCREEN TO BLOCK THE FUEL FLOW. THE PLT 
SUSPECTED THAT ICE MAY HAVE FORMED IN A LOW POINT IN THE FUEL PLUMBING 
THAT COULD NOT BE DRAINED. HOWEVER, THE TEMP ROSE ABOVE FREEZING 
ABOUT 2.4 HRS BEFORE THE FLT. WATER WAS DRAINED FROM A T-FITTING THAT 
ACTED AS A SUMP, BUT COULD ONLY BE DRAINED BY REMOVING A PLUG.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
