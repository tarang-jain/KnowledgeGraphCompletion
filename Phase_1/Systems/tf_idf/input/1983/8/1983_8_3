Analysis 
THE PLT REPORTED THAT A NEIGHBOR HAD FLOWN THE ACFT EARLIER IN THE DAY 
& HAD PROBLEMS ADJUSTING THE ELEVATOR TRIM WHEN AIRBORNE. THE PLT 
STATED THAT BEFORE TAKEOFF, HE CHECKED THE TRIM, BUT IT WORKED 
NORMALLY, SO HE SET IT FOR CRUISE & MADE A NORMAL TAKEOFF. WHILE 
TURNING TO A X-WIND LEG, HE TRIED TO ADJUST THE ELEVATOR TRIM, BUT IT 
WOULD NOT OPERATE. THE PLT THEN TRIED TO RELIEVE THE AIRLOAD ON THE 
STABILIZOR BY PULLING BACK ON THE STICK TO GO INTO A CLIMB, THEN 
RELEASING THE BACK PRESSURE TO PUT THE ACFT IN A NEAR ZERO 'G' CONDITION. 
HE WAS STILL UNABLE TO MOVE THE TRIM. THE PLT PULLED UP AGAIN, BUT A 
LITTLE HARDER. HOWEVER, THIS TIME THE ACFT STALLED & WENT INTO A SPIN. 
THE PLT WAS UNABLE TO RECOVER BEFORE THE ACFT HIT THE GROUND. AN 
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE ELEVATOR TRIM WAS IN A SLIGHT NOSE 
DOWN POSITION, BUT NO PREIMPACT/MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION WAS DETECTED.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
