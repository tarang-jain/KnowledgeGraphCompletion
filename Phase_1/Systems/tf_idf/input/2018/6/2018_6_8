Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The flight instructor reported that, after demonstrating a simulated emergency landing, he 
taxied the airplane off the runway and prepared to back taxi for departure. While taxiing, the 
instructor and student monitored the right-wing tip clearance to the overgrown brush on the 
right side of the runway, but the right wing became entangled, and the airplane veered right. 
The instructor added left rudder and brake, but the airplane impacted a ditch. 
Postaccident examination revealed that the right wing struck a tree and sustained substantial 
damage.
The instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions 
with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's failure to maintain adequate clearance from overgrown brush during 
taxi, which resulted in entanglement with the brush and a subsequent impact with a tree.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=97398
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
