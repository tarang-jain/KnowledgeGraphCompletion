Location:
Ferris, TX
Accident Number:
GAA18CA149
Date & Time:
03/01/2018, 1100 UTC 
Registration:
N77MM
Aircraft:
BEECH B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Ferry
Analysis   
The pilot in the multi-engine, retractable landing gear airplane reported that, during an 
instrument flight rules cross-country flight, about 5,000 ft above mean sea level, the left engine 
surged several times and he performed an emergency engine shutdown. Shortly afterward, the 
right engine lost power. 
During the emergency descent, the airplane struck treetops, and landed hard in a field with the 
landing gear retracted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings, the engine mounts, and the lower 
fuselage.
The pilot reported that he had requested 200 gallons of fuel from his home airport fixed base 
operator, but they did not fuel the airplane. The pilot did not check the fuel quantity during his 
preflight inspection.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration Airplane Flying Handbook, Chapter 2, page 
2-7, pilots must always positively confirm the fuel quantity by visually inspecting the fuel level 
in each tank.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Page 2 of 4GAA18CA149
The pilot's improper preflight inspection of the fuel level, which resulted in a loss of engine 
power due to fuel exhaustion. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to lower the 
landing gear before the emergency landing.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=96829
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
