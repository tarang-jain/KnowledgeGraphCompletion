Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
On February 2, 2018, about 1105 Pacific standard time, a Beech 95, N128W, departed runway 
30L after landing at the North Las Vegas Airport (VGT), Las Vegas, Nevada. The airplane was 
operated by Sheble Aviation as an instructional flight under 14 
Code of Federal Regulations
 
Part 91. The flight instructor and student pilot were not injured. The airplane sustained 
substantial damage to the left wing. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local 
area training flight that departed VGT at 0830; No flight plan had been filed.
According to the flight instructor, the student was practicing single-engine approaches to 
runway 30L, with a simulated engine out of the number 2 (left engine). The airplane was low 
on the approach, and the student was instructed to add power to the number 1 engine (right). 
The student advanced the throttle for the right engine, but there was no increase in 
power/thrust. The flight instructor told the student to push both throttles full forward and 
make a go-around. The right engine returned to full power; however, the left engine failed to 
produce any thrust. The airplane entered a VMC (minimum control speed) roll condition 
toward the critical engine (left), and impacted terrain.
The airplane was recovered for further examination.
