Aviation Accident Preliminary Report
Location:
Willow, AK
Accident Number:
ANC19LA005
Date & Time:
11/01/2018, 1700 AKD 
Registration:
N3227M
Aircraft:
Piper PA 12
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On November 1, 2018, about 1700 Alaska daylight time, a Piper PA-12 airplane, N3227M, 
sustained substantial damage during a forced landing, about 8 miles northwest of Willow 
Airport (PAUO) near Willow, Alaska. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot 
as a 14 
Code of Federal Regulations
 (CFR) Part 91 visual flight rules flight when the accident 
occurred. The commercial pilot sustained serious injuries. Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and no flight plan had been filed for the local area flight. The flight had departed a 
private airstrip located about 1 mile east of the accident location about 1659.
According to the pilot, just after departure and during the initial climb, all engine power 
ceased. When the loss of power occurred, it was accompanied by "three pops like a backfire." 
He then switched from operating on the left fuel tank to the right fuel tank and turned on 
carburetor heat, but the engine failed to respond. Faced with the decision to land in a river or 
trees, the pilot selected the trees. During the forced landing, the airplane sustained substantial 
damage to the wings and fuselage. 
A friend of the pilot stated that this was the first flight following engine maintenance. They had 
been troubleshooting engine events, to include excessive magneto drops and a cold cylinder. 
The Fine Wire spark plugs had just been reinstalled following removal and cleaning utilizing a 
blasting technique. Believing the issues were resolved, the pilot was departing for a local flight 
when the accident occurred.
The airplane was equipped with a Lycoming O-320 series engine. A detailed engine 
examination is pending.
