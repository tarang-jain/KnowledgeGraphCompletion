Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The pilot receiving instruction in the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the 
landing roll, the airplane veered to the left. He applied right rudder and brake to correct, but 
the airplane continued to veer to the left. In an attempt to maintain directional control, he 
added power with left rudder and brake. Subsequently, the flight instructor pulled the engine 
power back and applied right rudder, but the airplane continued to the left and the right wing 
impacted the ground.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and aileron.
The pilot reported that the airplane previously had a tendency to veer to the left during the 
landing roll. He further reported that, repairs were made during a recent annual inspection 
and noted that "thicker brake spaces" had been installed.
The instructor reported in a telephone conversation that there were no preaccident mechanical 
failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing. Contributing to the accident 
was the flight instructor's delayed remedial action.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=96970
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
