Aviation Accident Preliminary Report
Location:
La Verne, CA
Accident Number:
WPR19FA001
Date & Time:
10/01/2018, 1150 PDT 
Registration:
N7997M
Aircraft:
Beech V35
Injuries:
1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On October 1, 2018, about 1150 Pacific daylight time, a Beech V35 airplane, N7997M, was 
destroyed when it impacted terrain while on approach to landing at Brackett Field Airport 
(POC), La Verne, California. The private pilot sustained fatal injuries. The airplane was 
registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of Title 14 
Code of Federal 
Regulations
 Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for 
the personal flight. The flight originated from Blythe, California, about 1020, with an intended 
destination of POC.
Preliminary information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration revealed that the air 
traffic control tower controller cleared the accident pilot to make a straight-in approach for 
runway 8R. During the approach, the pilot was advised by the controller about another 
airplane that was inbound for runway 8L, and the pilot was then cleared to land on runway 8R.
Witnesses located near the accident site reported that they heard a noise and observed the 
accident airplane in a left bank that progressively continued to steepen before the airplane 
impacted the ground in a left wing, nose low attitude. The witnesses further reported that 
shortly after the impact, a post impact fire ensued.
Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane struck a tree, approximately 50 ft in 
height, about 900 ft from the approach end of runway 8R, and about 185 ft left of the runway 
centerline. The wreckage debris path was about 400 ft in length, oriented on a heading of about 
070째 magnetic. The forward portion of the fuselage and the inboard sections of both wings 
were mostly consumed by fire. All major structural components of the airplane were identified 
within the debris field. The wreckage was recovered to a secure location for further 
examination.
