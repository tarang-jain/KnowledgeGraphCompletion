Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Auxvasse, MO
Accident Number:
CEN09CA092
Date & Time:
12/05/2008, 1400 CST 
Registration:
N1521Q
Aircraft:
CESSNA 150
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The pilot departed the local airport with intent of practicing traffic pattern work and basic 
flight maneuvers.  After 3 touch and go maneuvers, the pilot departed the traffic pattern and 
flew the airplane to the designated practice area.  After performing a couple 360-degrees turns 
and slow flight, the pilot attempted a power-off stall.  In order to prepare for the power-off 
stall, the pilot retarded the throttle and applied the carburetor heat.  During the recovery of the 
power-off stall, the pilot "rapidly" applied engine power, closed the carburetor heat, and the 
engine lost power.  The pilot attempted to restart the engine, however, the restart was 
unsuccessful.  The pilot elected to perform an emergency off-airport landing.  During the 
forced landing to a field, the pilot landed the airplane in a downwind direction and was high on 
the final approach.  The pilot stated that he should have slipped the airplane during the 
approach which would have allowed for "use of more of the chosen field...a longer flare and a 
lighter touchdown at a lower airspeed."  The airplane impact crops and terrain and came to rest 
on its nose.  Examination of the airplane revealed the firewall was buckled.  According to a 
designated pilot examiner, the rapid throttle application can result in engine flooding and 
subsequent engine failure.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's improper engine recovery procedures after a power-off stall which resulted in a loss 
of engine power.  Contributing factors were the pilot's improper off-field landing procedures, 
and the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
