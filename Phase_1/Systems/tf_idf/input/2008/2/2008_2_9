Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Mukilteo, WA
Accident Number:
SEA08LA068
Date & Time:
02/02/2008, 1230 PST 
Registration:
N8794V
Aircraft:
Bellanca 17-30A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
While the pilot was on short-final for a touch-and-go landing, the airplane's engine lost all 
power. Because he was at such a low altitude, he did not have time to go through a complete 
restart procedure, so after switching fuel tanks, he aligned the airplane to land on a paved road 
that was under his approach path. While attempting to land on that road, the airplane clipped a 
power line and descended into the surface of the road. An inspection of the engine, fuel system, 
and air induction system did not reveal any system or component anomaly that would have 
prevented the engine from producing rated horsepower. Both the fuel tank that was selected 
prior to the power loss, and the fuel tank that was selected after the power loss contained 
sufficient fuel to maintain operation of the engine. Fuel was also found in the fuel manifold 
valve. The reason for the loss of power was not determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Loss of engine power while on final approach for undetermined reasons. Contributing to the 
accident was a power line.

Factual Information
On February 2, 2008, about 1230 Pacific standard time, a Bellanca 17-30A, N8794V, collided 
with a power line during an attempted forced landing at Snohomish County Airport (Paine 
Field), Mukilteo, Washington. The commercial pilot, who was the sole occupant of the airplane, 
received serious injuries, and the airplane, which was owned and operated by the pilot, 
sustained substantial damage. The local 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 personal 
pleasure flight, which departed the same airport about 15 minutes prior to the accident, was 
being operated in visual meteorological conditions. No flight plan had been filed. There was no 
report of an ELT activation.
According to the pilot, the airplane's engine lost all power while he was on short-final for a 
touch-and-go landing. Because he was at such a low altitude, he did not have time to go 
through a complete restart procedure, so after switching fuel tanks, he aligned the airplane to 
land on a paved road that was under his approach path. While attempting to land on that road, 
the airplane clipped a power line near the edge of the road. After hitting the power line, the 
airplane rolled to a steep angle of bank, and descended into the surface of the road.
The engine, fuel system, and air induction system underwent a post-accident teardown 
inspection. That inspection did not reveal any system or component anomaly that would have 
prevented the engine from producing rated horsepower. In addition, both the fuel tank that 
was selected prior to the power loss, and the fuel tank that was selected after the power loss 
contained sufficient fuel to maintain operation of the engine. Fuel was also found in the fuel 
manifold valve, and the use of water detection paste determined that there was no water 
present in the valve.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
