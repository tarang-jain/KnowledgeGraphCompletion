Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Alexandria, MN
Accident Number:
CHI08LA180
Date & Time:
07/02/2008, 0700 CDT 
Registration:
N601TS
Aircraft:
SMITH Aerostar 601P
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
4 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Business
Analysis 
The pilot reported that on the previous flight the left engine surged at 14,700 feet and the flight 
could not be conducted at the planned altitude of 19,000 feet. He stated that during descent to 
land the engines performed normally at lower altitudes. After landing he talked with a 
mechanic on the telephone and a decision was made to conduct the next leg of the trip at a 
lower altitude. During the takeoff, a loss of power was experienced and the pilot attempted to 
return to the airport.  During the turn back to the airport, the airplane lost altitude and the 
pilot decided to turn away from the populated areas and land the airplane in a field. During the 
landing the airplane struck a ditch. An examination of the airplane subsequent to the accident 
did not reveal any defects that would have resulted in a loss of engine power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons. Contributing to the accident was the 
unsuitable terrain for the forced landing.
Findings

Factual Information
On July 2, 2008, about 0700 central daylight time, a Smith Aerostar 601P, N601TS, piloted by 
an airline transport pilot, sustained substantial damage during a forced landing following a loss 
of engine power on takeoff from the Chandler Field Airport, Alexandria, Minnesota.  The 14 
CFR Part 91 business flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions on an instrument 
flight rules flight plan.  There were no injuries reported to the pilot or three passengers.  The 
flight was originating at the time of the accident and Saint Louis, Missouri, was the intended 
destination.
The pilot reported that on the previous flight the left engine experienced surging at 14,700 feet 
and the flight could not be conducted at the expected altitude of 19,000 feet.  He stated that 
during descent the engines performed normally at lower altitudes. After landing, he talked with 
a mechanic on the telephone and a decision was made to conduct the next leg of the trip at a 
lower altitude. He stated that during the takeoff, as he rotated, he noticed that the airplane's 
performance was less than usual. He determined that insufficient runway remained to abort 
the takeoff and he elected to continue and return to the airport.  He stated that he was unable 
to determine which engine was the reason for the power loss. He stated that he was unable to 
climb higher than 150 feet above the ground or to accelerate beyond 110 miles per hour. The 
pilot reported that while attempting to turn back to the airport he lost speed and decided to 
turn the airplane away from the populated areas and land in a field that was southeast of the 
airport.  He reported that he touched down on level terrain, but the airplane subsequently 
struck a drainage ditch during the landing.
Both engines were Lycoming model IO-540-S1A5 engines and each had 4,316.5 hours total 
time in service.  The most recent overhaul of the engines was performed on July 1, 1994, and 
each engine had accumulated 458 hours since that overhaul. 
The airplane was examined subsequent to the accident. Both engines were rotated by hand and 
"thumb" compression was evident. Fuel was found in the fuel lines leading to the fuel servos 
and to the fuel manifolds. Fuel was found within the airplane's fuel tanks. Magneto timing was 
checked and was found to be within specifications.  Examination did not reveal any defects that 
would have resulted in a loss of engine power.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
