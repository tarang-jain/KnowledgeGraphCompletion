Factual Information
On June 1, 2008, at 1330 eastern daylight time, a Bell 47D1 helicopter, N74898, sustained 
substantial damage during a forced landing to a field after it experienced a severe shaking in 
the cyclic control during cruise flight near Carrollton, Ohio.  The commercial helicopter pilot 
was not injured. The 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight departed the 
Carrollton County-Tolson Airport (TSO), Carrollton, Ohio, at 1315 en route to Wheeling, West 
Virginia.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed.    
The pilot reported he had departed TSO and had flown about 8 miles when the helicopter's 
cyclic began to shake violently.  When he attempted to land, he could not get the helicopter to 
hover so he attempted a run-on landing.  The pilot reported that the helicopter's skid caught 
some high grass or rough terrain and the helicopter rolled on its side.  The pilot reported that 
the helicopter was operating normally prior to the accident.  
The inspection of the helicopter by a helicopter mechanic revealed no preexisting anomalies.  A 
broken hydraulic hose was sent to the National Transportation Safety Board's Investigator-In-
Charge (IIC) for inspection.  The inspection of the hose revealed no pre-impact anomaly.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
