Location:
Whitmore Lake, MI
Accident Number:
CHI08CA060
Date & Time:
01/04/2008, 1545 EST 
Registration:
N85393
Aircraft:
American Champion (ACAC) 7AC
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot encountered a partial loss of engine power during flight.  The use of carburetor heat 
did not regain the lost power.  The pilot performed a precautionary landing to a grass landing 
strip he had landed at before.  The airplane nosed over in the snow upon landing.  No pre-
impact anomalies were detected.  The local temperature and dew point was -2 degrees C and -9 
degrees C respectively.  The owner's recommendation was to "replace the metal tube with scat 
tube on carb heat side."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The partial loss of engine power for undetermined reasons during cruise and the unsuitable 
terrain encountered during the precautionary landing.  A factor was the snow-covered ground.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
