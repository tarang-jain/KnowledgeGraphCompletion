Analysis 
While on short final approach the pilot reduced engine power to idle and the engine lost power. 
A forced landing was made in a field short of the runway and the airplane incurred substantial 
damage. Examination of the engine by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, and a 
representative of the engine manufacturer revealed that the carburetor mixture and throttle 
stop were found to be out of adjustment. The Rotax maintenance manual requires checking of 
these adjustments during each 100-hour inspection.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power due to the failure of company maintenance personnel to comply with 
engine manufacturers requirements for carburetor adjustment during the 100-hour inspection.

Factual Information
On January 3, 2008, at 1545 eastern standard time, a Costruzioni Aeronautiche Techna P2002 
Sierra, certificated Light Sport airplane, N26WR, lost engine power during final approach and 
collided with the ground during the subsequent forced landing, at the Bay Bridge Airport 
(W29), Stevensville, Maryland. The airplane was substantially damaged. The commercial pilot 
was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight. The 
airplane was registered to and operated by CSP Leasing LLC under the provision of Title 14 
Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The flight originated from W29 at 1440. 
The pilot stated that during approach to W29 he reported downwind, base, and then final to 
runway 29. At about 100 feet above ground level he reduced the engine power to idle and 
subsequently lost engine power. He then made an emergency landing in a field short of runway 
29.
Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, and the engine's 
manufacturer revealed that there were 10 gallons of AVGAS in the wing tanks. During the 
examination of the engine the mechanical settings of the carburetor mixture and throttle stop 
were found to be out of adjustment. According to the Rotax maintenance manual the 
carburetor adjustments and synchronization should be checked at the 100-hour inspection. 
Review of the engine maintenance logbook revealed that the 100-hour inspection was 
conducted on December 17, 2007 at a Hobbs and total time of 113.4 hours, 19 flight hours 
before the accident. There were no recorded entries of the carburetor inspection or adjustment.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
