Registration:
N331MD
Aircraft:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
This was the certificated flight instructor's (CFI) first instructional flight with this new primary 
student. They did a preflight inspection of the helicopter together, and departed for the 
practice area. Once the student had a general understanding of the controls, they did an 
approach to a point on the ground that terminated in a hover.  The CFI was letting the student 
manipulate the controls more and more during the hover.  The CFI positioned the helicopter 
for a slight right quartering headwind to compensate for translating tendencies.  During hover, 
the helicopter exhibited a pendulum oscillation that is common for new students learning to 
hover.  During one of the right lateral oscillations, the helicopter unexpectedly lost altitude.  
The right skid contacted the ground, and the helicopter rolled onto its right side.  Within 
seconds, it caught on fire.  Both pilots exited immediately.  The CFI stated that the airplane and 
engine had no mechanical failures or malfunctions during the flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The instructor's inadequate supervision and delayed remedial action that resulted in ground 
contact and a rollover.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
