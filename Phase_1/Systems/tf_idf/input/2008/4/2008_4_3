Analysis   
The student was on a solo flight to practice touch-and-go landings. He said he made six 
successful landings, but noticed that the winds were increasing. On the seventh approach, the 
winds were variable and started to gust. The student said that he maintained 55 knots as he 
came over the approach end of the runway. The airplane suddenly drifted to the left side of the 
runway. He used ailerons, and corrected to the centerline. The airplane touched down hard, 
and bounced. After the airplane came to rest, he saw smoke and fire, and evacuated from the 
airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the student pilot's inadequate compensation for gusty, crosswind conditions, and failure to 
maintain an adequate airspeed.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
