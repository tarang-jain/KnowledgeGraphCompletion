Accident Number:
DFW06CA150
Date & Time:

Registration:
N8225K
Aircraft:
Grumman G-164B
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis   
The single-engine agricultural airplane collided with a set of power transmission lines while 
performing an aerial application flight.  The 15,000-hour pilot sustained serious injuries and 
the airplane was destroyed.  During an interview with a Federal Aviation Administration 
inspector, the pilot stated that prior to the accident the airplane was operating "fine."  
However, the pilot added that he had "no recollection" of the accident.  The FAA inspector 
reported that there were two sets of wires, a small local line and a set of tall, high-power 
transmission lines.  The pilot also told the inspector that the normal practice for them was to 
fly over both lines before descending to perform the application run.  The FAA inspector 
reported that he found a portion of the lower right wing resting near the location of the high 
power lines. The visibility at the time of the accident was reported at 10 statute miles, with no 
obstructions.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from the power transmission line(s).   A contributing 
factor was the low altitude selected by the pilot.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
