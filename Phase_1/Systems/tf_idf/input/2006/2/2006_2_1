Analysis   
The pilot stated that he entered a left downwind for runway 06 and extended his downwind 
due to another airplane being on left base for the same runway. He turned final and made 
several s-turns while waiting on the other airplane to clear the runway. Once the other airplane 
cleared the runway the pilot stated, "I lined up with the runway 06 and flared to land. My main 
landing gear struck the end of the pavement and sheared the left main gear." The pilot did not 
report any mechanical problems before the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's misjudgment of altitude/distance which resulted in an undershoot of the runway 
and subsequent impact with the runway collapsing the main landing gear.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
