Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The glider sustained substantial damage when it ground looped and skidded to a stop while 
landing at a grass airstrip.  The pilot reported that after releasing from the tow airplane at 
3,000 feet above ground level (agl), no thermal lift was encountered so he returned to the 
airstrip for landing.  He reported that he experienced a sink rate that "seemed very excessive" 
during the downwind leg.  He "cut the pattern short" and turned onto the base leg, which 
resulted in the glider being high on the base leg.  The pilot reported that he deployed the 
spoilers, but he was slow to retract the spoilers due to the "heavy force required to push the 
handle forward."  The glider lost altitude.  The pilot reported that the left wing caught the grass 
about the same time the glider touched down with the nose about 20 degrees off the runway 
heading.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate approach for landing and his failure to attain a proper descent rate.

Phase of Operation: LANDING
Findings
1. (C) PLANNED APPROACH - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
