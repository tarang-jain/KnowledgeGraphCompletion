Analysis   
The 164-hour private pilot reported that when the single-engine turbine powered helicopter 
was seven miles from the airport, the fuel boost pump caution light illuminated, and the fuel 
gauge was indicating approximately 15 gallons of fuel remaining.  The pilot elected to continue 
to fly towards the airport; however, while on final approach the engine lost power.  The pilot 
entered an autorotation, but due to his low altitude, he realized the descent angle would have 
placed the helicopter onto a busy four-lane highway.  The pilot added that he increased the 
collective, which increased altitude, and he was able to cross over the highway and a fence; 
however, this maneuver reduced inertia in the main rotor system.  As a result, the pilot flared 
over a wet, grassy field about 30 feet, leveled the helicopter and landed with some forward 
speed.  During touchdown, the skids dug into the ground and the helicopter came to an abrupt 
stop, toppled over, and came to rest upside down.  The tail boom separated and came to rest 
about 20 feet from the fuselage.  Examination of the helicopter revealed there was no fuel in 
the fuel nozzle or in the external fuel filter.  There was no indication of a fuel spill during the 
mishap sequence.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper pre-flight planning, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to 
fuel exhaustion.  A contributing factor was the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
