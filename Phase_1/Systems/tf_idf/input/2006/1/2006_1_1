Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The private pilot was on a visual flight rules cross country flight when he began encountering 
instrument conditions. The pilot continued into the instrument conditions for about 30 
minutes before asking Atlanta Approach Control for directions to the nearest airport for 
landing. The controller directed the pilot to two different nearby airports but both were below 
minimums. The pilot informed the controller that he was low on fuel and needed to land as 
soon as possible. The controller directed the pilot to the Columbus Metropolitan Airport, 
Columbus, Georgia. The pilot told the controllers that he would attempt an Instrument 
approach. The pilot attempted four unsuccessful approaches with the controllers talking him 
through each approach. On the fifth approach, at five miles from the runway the pilot stated 
that both engine's quit due to fuel exhaustion. The pilot called "mayday" and during the forced 
landing the airplane collided with trees and the ground separating the right wing, half of the 
left wing, and coming to rest inverted. The pilot did not report any mechanical deficiencies 
with the airplane during the attempted approaches.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate decision to continue VFR flight into IMC conditions, which resulted in a 
loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
