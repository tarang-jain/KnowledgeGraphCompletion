Analysis   
The pilot reported that after takeoff from runway 31, the airplane climbed to approximately 75 
feet above ground level and encountered a downdraft. The airplane impacted the runway 
causing substantial damage. An examination of the airplane's systems revealed no anomalies. 
Prior to departure, the pilot estimated the wind as 280 degrees at 15 knots. After the accident, a 
hand held wind meter recorded the winds at 8 knots, gusting to 18 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control during the departure climb. Contributing factors 
included the gusty winds and the downdraft.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
