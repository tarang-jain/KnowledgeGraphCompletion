Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The commercial certificated pilot reported that he was landing a tailwheel-equipped airplane 
while conducting a Title 14, CFR Part 91 personal flight.  During the landing roll, as the pilot 
was making a right rudder application, the nose abruptly veered to the right.  The pilot 
reported that the airplane ground looped to the right, and the left wingtip and left aileron 
struck the ground.  The lens covering a runway edge light fixture was also broken.  He said that 
he inadvertently applied the right brake as he was applying the right rudder correction.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during the landing roll, which 
resulted in the left wing striking the ground and a runway edge light.  Factors contributing to 
the accident were the pilot's inadvertent application of the right brake, and an inadvertent 
ground loop.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
