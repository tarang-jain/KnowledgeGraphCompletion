Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The 20,000-hour flight instructor reported that while on an instructional flight at about 700 
feet above ground level (AGL), he reduced the engine power to idle, applied carburetor heat, 
and asked the student pilot to perform a simulated forced landing.  The student pilot elected to 
land in a nearby field on a southerly heading  The flight instructor added that the field was 
adequate for the emergency landing; however, it would require the use of full flaps to make the 
approach.  At approximately 150 feet above ground level (AGL), the student pilot applied 
partial power and began retracting the electric flaps.  According to the flight instructor's 
statement, he increased the throttle to full power and slightly lowered the airplane's nose high 
attitude.  However, the airplane continued to lose altitude and then stalled just before entering 
the trees.  There was no fire and all three occupants were able to egress from the airplane 
unassisted.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's delayed remedial action during a simulated emergency landing, which 
resulted in an inadvertent stall.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
