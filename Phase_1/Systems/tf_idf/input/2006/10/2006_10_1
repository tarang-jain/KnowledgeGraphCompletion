Location:
Barton City, MI
Accident Number:
CHI07CA001
Date & Time:
10/01/2006, 1040 EDT 
Registration:
N64257
Aircraft:
Cessna 180K
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The airplane was substantially damaged when it overran the end of the runway on landing.  
The pilot reported that the intended destination was a private airstrip with an east-west 
oriented runway about 1,200 feet long, and a north-south oriented runway about 2,000 feet 
long.  The pilot stated that when he overflew the windsock before landing, it appeared that 
winds were about 10 knots directly out of the north.  He set up for a landing to the east; 
however, he "landed long" and subsequently  "ran out of runway."  The airplane encountered a 
rock pile located off the end of the runway.  The pilot reported that upon exiting the airplane 
after the accident, he noticed that the wind was variable and appeared to have shifted.  He 
commented that the wind might have gotten behind him on landing.  Winds recorded at the 
Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport (OSC), located about 16 nautical miles southeast of the accident 
site, at 1058, were from 280 degrees at 11 knots, gusting to 16 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to attain a proper touchdown point and his inadvertent selection of a 
downwind runway, which resulted in the overrun.  A contributing factor was the tailwind 
encountered during landing.  Additional factors were the wet, turf runway, and the rock pile 
located off the end of the runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
