Since the causes of aviation accidents and risks are complicated, concealed, unpredictable and difficult to be investigated, in order to achieve the efficient organization and knowledge sharing of the historical cases of aviation risk events, this paper put forward the method of constructing vertical knowledge graph for aviation risk field. Firstly, the  data-driven  incremental  construction  technology  is  used  to  build  aviation  risk  event  ontology  model.  Secondly,  the pattern-based knowledge mapping mechanism, which transform structured data into RDF (Resource Description Framework) data for storage, is proposed. And then the application, update and maintenance of the knowledge graph are  described.  Finally,  knowledge  graph  construction  system  in  aviation  risk  field  is  developed;  and  the  data  from  American Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) is used as an example to verify the rationality and validity of the knowledge  graph  construction  method.  Practice  has  proved  that  the  construction  of  knowledge  graph  has  a  guiding  significance for the case information organization and sharing on the field of aviation risk. Aviation accident is one of the most complex events. It is influenced by the aircraft performance, crew   contingency, bad weather, geographical conditions and other factors. The various influencing factors and  the  event  itself  constitute  a  complex  network  relationship  for  each  aviation  risk  event, and the same event set make up a huge knowledge network system, so two-dimensional relationship table canâ€™t show the complex relationships at all. Knowledge graph, as a direct representation of the relationship,  is more conducive to our effective analysis of the specific potential risks existing in those complex relationships.
