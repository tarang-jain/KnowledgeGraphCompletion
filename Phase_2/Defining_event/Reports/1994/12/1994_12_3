Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Ferry
Analysis 
THE AIRCRAFT WAS BEING OPERATED AS A FLIGHT OF TWO ON A FERRY FLIGHT 
FROM THE MARSHALL ISLANDS TO HONOLULU, HAWAII. THE AIRPLANE WAS 
EQUIPPED WITH AUXILIARY FUEL TANKS AND WAS OPERATED ON A SPECIAL 
AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATE THAT ALLOWED FOR 10 PERCENT OVER GROSS 
WEIGHT OPERATIONS.  ABOUT 2 HOURS AFTER DEPARTURE, WHILE AT AN ALTITUDE 
OF 7,000 FEET MEAN SEA LEVEL, THE ACCOMPANYING AIRPLANE NOTICED SMOKE 
TRAILING FROM THE LEFT ENGINE OF THE ACCIDENT AIRCRAFT.  THE TWO 
AIRCRAFT TURNED AROUND AND THE PILOT DECLARED AN EMERGENCY.  THE LEFT 
ENGINE OF THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE QUIT AND THE PILOT FEATHERED THE 
PROPELLER.  THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN LEVEL FLIGHT AND THE 
AIRCRAFT WAS DITCHED IN ROUGH WATER AND SUBSEQUENTLY SANK. THE PILOT 
WAS RESCUED ABOUT 20 HOURS AFTERWARDS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
An undetermined failure of the left engine.  The inability of the airplane to maintain level flight 
and exceeding the one-engine capability was a factor in the accident.

Factual Information
 On December 2, 1994, at 0348 hours Universal coordinated time, a Britten-Norman Islander 
BN2B-20, N16VM, ditched in the Pacific Ocean about 200 miles northeast of Majuro, Marshall 
Islands.  The airplane was being operated as an instrument flight rules (IFR) ferry flight to 
Honolulu, Hawaii, when the accident occurred.  The airplane, registered to Trans Island Air, 
Barbados, West Indies, and operated by Southern Cross Aviation, Camarillo, California, was 
destroyed.  The certificated commercial pilot, the sole occupant, received serious injuries.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  The airplane, departed at Majuro Airport, as a 
flight of two aircraft, at 0104 hours Universal coordinated time.
The pilot reported that the airplane was in cruise flight at 7,000 feet.  The pilot of the 
accompanying aircraft reported smoke trailing from the left engine of the accident airplane.  
The accident aircraft pilot then observed smoke and oil emanating from the left engine 
cowling.  The pilot advised air traffic control personnel that he was returning to Majuro as a 
precautionary measure and, shortly thereafter, declared an emergency.  The pilot operated the 
left engine until it failed completely.  He was unable to maintain level flight and slowly 
descended.  The airplane was ultimately ditched and the pilot was observed in a raft.  The pilot 
was rescued by search personnel about 20 hours after the ditching.  The airplane was not 
recovered.
The pilot holds a commercial pilot certificate with airplane single-engine land, multiengine 
land, and instrument airplane ratings.  In addition, the pilot holds a flight instructor certificate 
with airplane single- and multiengine and instrument ratings.  The most recent first-class 
medical certificate was issued to the pilot on August 1, 1994, and contained no limitations.
According to the pilot/operator report submitted by the operator, the pilot's total aeronautical 
experience consists of about 9,900 hours, of which about 150 hours were accrued in the 
accident aircraft make and model.  In the preceding 90 and 30 days prior to the accident, the 
report lists a total of 180 and 60 hours, respectively, flown. 
The aircraft had been operated in China prior to the accident flight.  Prior to the accident flight, 
an auxiliary fuel tank system was installed and the aircraft was being operated on a special 
airworthiness certificate that allowed for 10 percent over maximum gross weight operations.  
Review of the maintenance records revealed that a 2,000-hour inspection was conducted on 
April 26, 1994.  A 100-hour inspection was completed on November 3, 1994.  At that time, the 
aircraft had accrued 2,302 hours of operation.  On November 18, 1994, the last recorded 
maintenance entry indicated that the airplane had accumulated a total time in service of about 
2,359 flight hours.
The left engine was overhauled on January 19, 1994.  No record of the engine's total accrued 
time was noted.  On November 10, 1994, the No. 2 cylinder rod and cover was replace due to 
deformation.  The logbook entry indicated an accrued time of 2,359 hours.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
