designated parking areas.

Factual Information
     On December 3, 1994, about 1730 eastern standard time, a Sikorsky UH-60A, serial number 
23321, registered to U.S. Army Aviation Command, operated by the U.S. Customs Service, on a 
public-use positioning flight, collided with a hangar while ground taxiing into a parking area at 
the St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport, St. Petersburg, Florida. The helicopter 
sustained substantial damage. The airline transport-rated pilot, commercial pilot, copilot, air 
interdiction officer, and two occupants were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and an agency flight plan was filed. The flight originated from Jacksonville Naval Air 
Station, Jacksonville, Florida, about 1 hour before the accident.
     The airline transport-rated pilot-in-command (PIC), and copilot stated after landing they 
taxied to the U.S. Customs ramp where they were met by maintenance personnel. The PIC was 
asked to park in a grassy area. They informed the maintenance employee that they had night 
vision goggles and weapons on board the helicopter, and needed to park in a secure area 
between the two hangers. No request was made by the PIC, nor was he asked by maintenance 
personnel if he wanted marshalling support while taxiing the helicopter. He taxied into the 
unmarked parking area along the northwest corner of the ramp, made a right turn towards the 
south, and continued towards the southeast corner of the ramp. As they started the final right 
turn, a crewmember stated, "we are getting close," and the main rotor blades collided with the 
hanger.
     Information pertaining to aircraft information is contained in NTSB Form 6120.1/2 and 
NTSB Form 6120.4.
     Toxicology studies of specimens from the pilot-in-command, and copilot were negative for 
neutral, acidic, and basic drugs.
     Review of written procedures at the Jacksonville Air Branch, Tampa Air Unit, SERV-AIR 
Inc., Standard Operating Procedures, and the Aviation Operations Handbook for U.S. 
Customs, revealed there are no written procedures concerning designated parking areas, 
marking of parking areas, and marshalling of aircraft.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
