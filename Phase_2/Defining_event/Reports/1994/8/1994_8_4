Analysis 
AT APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND, THE PILOT TURNED OFF THE 
SPRAYING NOZZLES AND INITIATED A CLIMBING TURN-AROUND MANEUVER. 
OBSTRUCTIONS BLOCKED THE WITNESSES VIEW OF THE AIRPLANE DURING THE 
TURN-AROUND AND IMPACT. THE AIRPLANE CAME TO REST IN A VERTICAL 
POSITION WITH THE AIRPLANE HOPPER AND ENGINE BURIED IN 2 1/2 FEET OF 
WATER AND MUD IN A RICE FIELD. THE COMMERCIAL PILOT'S TRAINING INCLUDED 
AERIAL APPLICATION. HIS COMMERCIAL CERTIFICATE WAS OBTAINED ON MAY 18, 
1994. SCHOOL PERSONNEL REPORTED THAT INSTRUCTORS CAUTIONED THE PILOT 
ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS TO HAVE RESPECT FOR THE AIRPLANE AND TO 
PERFORM A SLOW PULL UP DURING THE TURN-AROUND MANEUVER. ASSOCIATES 
STATED THEY OBSERVED THE PILOT PERFORM STEEP  TURN-AROUND MANEUVERS 
ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
INADVERTENT STALL DUE TO PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AIRSPEED. A FACTOR 
WAS THE PILOT'S OVER CONFIDENCE IN HIS PERSONAL ABILITY.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT:
On August 1, 1994, at 1030 central daylight time, an Air Tractor AT-301, N23358, was 
substantially damaged while maneuvering near Hunter, Arkansas.  The commercial pilot 
received fatal injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the aerial application 
flight.
Witnesses and the operator reported the following information.  The aerial application flight 
departed from a private grass airstrip at the rice farm.  The pilot started spraying about 0900 
and was dispensing fungicide on the rice field.  During the pilot's second spray run, he was 
dispensing the fungicide in a west to east flight path above the rice field.  At approximately 50 
feet above the ground, the pilot turned off the spraying nozzles and initiated a climbing turn-
around maneuver.  Obstructions blocked the witnesses view of the airplane during the turn 
around.  Witnesses heard the impact, reported the accident, and assisted the pilot.      
PERSONNEL INFORMATION:
The pilot began flight training on June 21, 1993, and obtained his private pilot rating on 
February 28, 1994.  A review of the pilot's logbook revealed that he accumulated a total flight 
time of 28.6 hours (17.3 spraying training) in the PA-18-150, 20 hours of spraying training in 
the PA-25-235, and 31.5 hours of spraying training in the AT-301.  He satisfactorily completed 
the commercial rating on May 18, 1994.  The Pilot/Operator Report states 150 hours total time 
in the AT-301.  
During interviews, associates and training personnel reported the following information.  The 
pilot was among the top 5 percent of the students trained in the agricultural training school. 
Instructors at the school had to make the pilot wear his helmet during the agricultural training.  
They recalled telling the pilot on numerous occasions to have respect for the airplane.  They 
emphasized to the pilot how important it was for a slow pull up during the turn around 
maneuver.  Associates described the pilot as wearing a cowboy hat instead of the helmet and 
"cowboying the airplane."  They observed the pilot perform steep turn-around maneuvers on 
numerous occasions.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION:
Local authorities stated the airplane remained intact and came to rest in a vertical position.  
The airplane hopper and engine was found buried in 2 1/2 feet of water and mud in the rice 
field.  The top of the cabin was facing in an easterly direction with the leading edges of the 
wings resting in the rice plants.
Major components were recovered prior to the on scene arrival of the investigator-in-charge.  
The leading edges of the wings were crushed and buckled.  Horizontal stabilizer rods were 
separated consistent with overload.  Flight control continuity was established.
The engine exhibited impact damage on the cylinders and accessories.  There were no 
anomalies found with the engine or accessories.  The metal chip detector and oil filter were 
clean.  Fuel continuity was established to the engine.  The propeller blades exhibited bending 
and torsional twisting.  Fuel tank lines were compromised.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
