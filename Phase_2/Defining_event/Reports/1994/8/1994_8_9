Registration:
N7GJ
Aircraft:
GROCE VANS RV-4
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
An airline customer service agent observed the aircraft during takeoff, noting that it was 
airborne at 10 to 15 feet above the ground and 'not really gaining altitude.' She did not witness 
the crash. The captain of a commuter flight noted that 'after rotation approx 25' or so, his left 
wing dipped downward, aircraft seemed under powered. It was hot, Density alt(itude) 5200' 
lite gusty winds.' The commuter captain did not see the aircraft crash. Witnesses noted that the 
airplane became airborne in the  first quarter of the runway. During on-site inspection, FAA 
inspectors noted that the aft cockpit was loaded with camping gear, including a tent, 
campstove, six cans of food, a large clothing bag, camera, headset, and five or six jars, as well as 
an extensive collection of aviation literature. When the wreckage was inspected, no mechanical 
discrepancies were noted by FAA personnel. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
AIRSPEED WAS NOT MAINTAINED AFTER TAKEOFF.  A FACTOR WAS HIGH DENSITY 
ALTITUDE. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER
Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - INITIAL CLIMB
Findings
1. (F) WEATHER CONDITION - HIGH DENSITY ALTITUDE
2. (C) AIRSPEED - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND

Factual Information
 On August 1, 1994, at 1415 mountain daylight time, an experimental Groce Vans RV-4, N7GJ, 
was destroyed when it collided with terrain after takeoff from runway 20 at Glendive, Montana.  
The commercial pilot, the sole occupant, was fatally injured in the crash.  There was no flight 
plan filed for the flight, which was conducted in visual meteorological conditions.  The aircraft 
was destroyed by post-crash fire.  No report of an ELT was made.  
The pilot had stopped at Glendive to refuel his aircraft after visiting a fly-in in Oshkosh, 
Wisconsin.  The aircraft was fueled with 17.5 gallons of auto gas.  Before leaving, the pilot 
stated that he thought the fuel required to top off the aircraft would have been 16 gallons.  
A Big Sky Airlines customer service agent observed the aircraft during takeoff, noting that he 
was airborne at 10 to 15 feet above the ground and "not really gaining altitude."  She did not 
witness the crash.  The captain of the commuter flight noted that "after rotation approx 25' or 
so, his left wing dipped downward, aircraft seemed under powered.  It was hot, Density 
alt(itude) 5200' lite gusty winds."  The commuter captain did not see the aircraft crash.  
During on-site inspection, FAA inspectors noted that the aft cockpit was loaded with camping 
gear, including a tent, campstove, six cans of food, a large clothing bag, camera, headset, and 
five or six jars, as well as an extensive collection of aviation literature.  Witnesses observed the 
takeoff, but did not see the crash.  They noted that the aircraft became airborne in the first 
quarter of the runway.
When the wreckage was inspected, no mechanical discrepancies were noted by FAA personnel.  
Empty weight of the aircraft was noted to be 875 pounds, May 23, 1987.  At the time of 
weighing, the aircraft was unpainted, landing gear leg fairings and wheel pants, metal wing 
fairings, seat cushions, rear control stick, and avionics were not installed on the aircraft.  
Maximum gross weight is 1500 pounds, and total fuel capacity is 32 gallons.  Density altitude 
was calculated to be 5332 feet.
An autopsy was performed on the pilot by Pathology Consultants, PC, Billings, Montana, for 
the Dawson County Coroner.  The Pathologist noted that the pilot died from blunt force 
injuries.  No causes predisposing to the accident could be seen on post morem examination.  
Toxicological testing was done by the FAA with negative results for drugs and ethanol.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
