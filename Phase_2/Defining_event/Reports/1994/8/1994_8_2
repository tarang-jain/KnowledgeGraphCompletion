II
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation -
Analysis 
The pilot was demonstrating the capabilities of the experimental amphibious airplane to the 
passenger.  The pilot reported that during the initial climb following her second water touch-
and-go landing, the airplane was approaching the trees on the edge of the lake.  She attempted 
to turn but the airplane descended and impacted the water.  A witness reported the airplane 
stalled and the wing struck the water. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's inadvertent stall of the airplane.  Factors were the tailwind condition and the pilot's 
inadequate compensation for the tailwind. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - IN FLIGHT
Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - INITIAL CLIMB
Findings
1. (F) WEATHER CONDITION - TAILWIND
2. (F) COMPENSATION FOR WIND CONDITIONS - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND
3. (C) STALL - INADVERTENT - PILOT IN COMMAND

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On August 1, 1994, at 0920 central daylight time, an experimental Charles J. Keuthan 
Buccaneer II airplane, N5296C, sustained substantial damage during a water touch-and-go 
landing at the Vette Seaplane Base in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.  The commercial pilot and the sole 
passenger sustained minor injuries.  The business flight departed the Wittman Regional 
Airport, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, about 0900 and was conducted under CFR Part 91 in visual 
meteorological conditions.  The planned destination was the Wittman Regional Airport and no 
flight plan was filed.
The pilot said she was employed by the operator to give demonstration rides to potential 
customers.  The flight was conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the experimental 
amphibious airplane to the passenger.  They departed the Experimental Aircraft Association 
(EAA) convention at Wittman Regional Airport and flew to the Vette Seaplane Base.  
She flew one uneventful touch-and-go landing on the water.  Following the second touch-and-
go landing, during the initial climb,  she felt like the airplane was not climbing at a normal rate.  
She said all engine instruments were normal and she thought the airplane was going to impact 
the trees at the edge of the lake.  She attempted to turn and perform an emergency landing, but 
the airplane descended and impacted the water.
A witness to the accident said he saw the airplane takeoff downwind on a heading of about 210 
degrees with northerly winds of about 10 knots.  He said it was approaching the trees, turned, 
and then stalled.  A wing tip caught in the water and the airplane spun in.
PERSONAL INFORMATION
The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with a single engine land rating.  She did not hold 
a single engine sea rating.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The NTSB on scene investigation began about 1100.  The airplane was located on the shore at 
the western edge of the Vette Seaplane Base.  A witness said he helped to move the airplane up 
from the water and had extended the landing gear.
The front four feet of the hull was fractured circumferentially in the upward direction.  The 
trailing edge of the right wing was bent downward outboard of the lift struts and the right 
sponson was twisted.  The left forward lift strut was fractured.  The engine assembly was 
twisted on the mount and the fuselage mounted fuel tank was filled with water.
ADDITIONAL DATA/INFORMATION
Following the on scene portion of the investigation, the wreckage was released to the owner.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
