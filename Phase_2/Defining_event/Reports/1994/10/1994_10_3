Factual Information
 On October 1, 1994, about 1700 central daylight time, a Cessna 188, N731PS, groundlooped 
during the landing roll at Covington, Tennessee. The airplane was operated by Baker Flying 
Service under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 137, and visual flight rules. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed. A flight plan was not filed for the aerial application flight. There were 
serious injuries to the commercial pilot, and the airplane was substantially damaged. 
Origination of the flight was Covington, Tennessee, about 1615.
The pilot reported that the airplane veered left during the landing and that the right rudder 
pedal and brake did not operate to oppose the divergent ground path. An inspector from the 
Tennessee Flight Standards District Office, Memphis, Tennessee, spoke with the pilot, and 
examined the accident site and the airplane, after the accident. He reported that the pilot said 
he was attempting to land on the runway, and overshot it. The airplane landed in the grass 
beside the runway. Tire tracks showed a normal landing roll, until about the last 700 feet 
where the tracks showed the airplane veered left, then entered a skid, breaking off the right 
main landing gear at the attachment point. The right wing then, struck the ground. According 
to the inspector, the rudder pedal, rudder cable, and rudder functioned. The brake pad did not 
exhibit excessive wear and the hydraulic line did not exhibit any pre-impact failure.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
