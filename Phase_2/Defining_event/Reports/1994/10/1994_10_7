Analysis 
PRIVATE PILOTS, ENROLLED IN A PROFESSIONAL PILOT COURSE, WERE BUILDING 
CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT TIME FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL CERTIFICATION. ON THE 
RETURN FLIGHT FROM CALIFORNIA TO TEXAS, ROUTING WAS PLANNED THROUGH 
COLORADO FOR THE INSTRUCTIONAL PORTION OF THE MOUNTAIN CURRICULUM. 
AIRMETS INCLUDED WEATHER ADVISORIES FOR TURBULENCE. THE FLIGHT 
INSTRUCTOR AMENDED THE FLIGHT ROUTE AND CONTINUED EVEN THOUGH 
FLIGHT WATCH ISSUED THE AIRMET FOR TURBULENCE AND THAT VFR WAS NOT 
RECOMMENDED. COMPANY PERSONNEL REPORTED THAT THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR 
HAD MADE NUMEROUS FLIGHTS ALONG THE REGULAR MOUNTAIN FLYING 
CURRICULUM ROUTE (HIGHEST ELEVATION 9,927 FEET); HOWEVER, 'THIS WAS THE 
INSTRUCTOR'S FIRST TRIP CROSSING THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE THROUGH THE 
CANYON AT ELWOOD PASS' AN ELEVATION OF 11,875 FEET. DENSITY ALTITUDE WAS 
CALCULATED AT 14,000 FEET. THIS WAS THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR'S SECOND 
DEMONSTRATION THAT DAY FOR A 180 DEGREE TURN- AROUND PROCEDURE IN A 
BOX CANYON ENVIRONMENT. THE INSTRUCTOR STATED THAT 'NEAR THE 
COMPLETION OF THE TURN, WE EXPERIENCED A SEVERE UNEXPECTED 
DOWNDRAFT' WITH A RESULTING RATE OF DECENT OF '6,000 FPM' AND THE 
AIRPLANE HIT THE TREES. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S CONTINUED FLIGHT INTO KNOWN ADVERSE WEATHER. FACTORS WERE 
THE PILOT'S LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA, THE 
TURBULENCE AND HIGH DENSITY ALTITUDE.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT:
On October 1, 1994, at 1420 mountain daylight time, a Piper       PA-28R-200, N1480X, was 
destroyed while maneuvering to reverse flight direction near Pagosa Springs, Colorado.  The 
airline transport rated pilot/flight instructor and the two private pilots received serious 
injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the cross country mountain flying 
instructional flight.
During interviews and on the enclosed statements the operator and flight instructor reported 
the information in this paragraph.  The flight originally departed the Le Tourneau University 
Flight School on September 29, 1994, at Longview, Texas, for a cross country flight to Palm 
Springs, California.  The two private pilots were enrolled in Le Tourneau University Title 14 
CFR Part 141 professional pilot course and were building cross country flight time toward their 
commercial certification.  On the return flight, routing was planned through Colorado for the 
mountain portion of the course curriculum.  
On October 1, 1994, the flight departed Page, Arizona, for Salida, Colorado.  The private pilot 
and flight instructor evaluated the in flight weather and amended the flight plan for a more 
southerly route with a destination change to Alamosa, Colorado.  The amended route was to 
follow the road from Pagosa Springs, Colorado, over Wolf Creek Pass, to Alamosa.  As the flight 
continued, they realized a selection of the "wrong road" and the flight instructor made the 
decision for a turn-around at about 2,500 feet above ground level according to the enclosed 
statement.  This was the flight instructor's second demonstration for the day on how to do a 
180 degree turn around procedure in a box canyon environment.  The flaps were fully extended 
prior to turning the airplane.  The instructor turned the airplane to the "right side of the 
canyon (south) and then began the turn back towards the left in a bank of approximately 35 
degrees."  The flight instructor stated that "near the completion of the turn, we experienced a 
severe unexpected downdraft" with a resulting rate of descent of "6,000 FPM"  and the 
airplane hit the trees. 
PERSONNEL INFORMATION:
Flight Instructor records from the school and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
indicated that he was designated as the chief flight instructor on August 24, 1989.  The 
designation included a standardization flight in the PA-28R-200.  On February 13, 1994, the 
flight instructor satisfactorily completed an AOPA Air Safety Foundation flight instructor 
refresher clinic and an FAA surveillance on July 21, 1995.  
During interviews, school personnel stated that the mountain flying curriculum route, with a 
departure from Longview, Texas, included Alexander Airport, Salida, Colorado; Buena Vista 
Airport, Buena Vista, Colorado; and Lake County Airport, Leadville, Colorado, with the highest 
elevation at 9,927 feet.  The school curriculum does not specify a minimum altitude in 
mountainous terrain.  They reported that the flight instructor had made numerous flights 
along this route; however, "this was the instructor's first trip crossing the continental divide 
through the canyon at Elwood Pass" an elevation of 11,875 feet.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION:
A review of the enclosed weather data revealed the information in this paragraph.  Winds aloft 
Page 4 of 7FTW95FA002
throughout the area from 9,000 feet MSL through 18,000 MSL feet were from the southwest at 
15 to 24 knots.  Temperature aloft was 35 degrees Fahrenheit with a surface temperature at 70 
degrees Fahrenheit.  The calculated density altitude at the accident elevation of 11,400 feet was 
14,000 feet.  Airmets for the area included occasional mountain obscurement (clouds, 
precipitation, and fog) and moderate turbulence throughout Colorado.  An airmet for 
occasional moderate mixed icing in clouds and precipitation between 12,000 feet MSL and 
FL200 was valid.  VFR flight was not recommended.
COMMUNICATIONS:
A review of flight service station data (enclosed) revealed the following summary information.  
All times are converted to mountain daylight time unless otherwise indicated.
1033:     The pilot obtained a standard weather briefing and filed a VFR flight plan via 
telephone with Prescott Flight Service Station (FSS), from Page (PGA), Arizona, to Salida 
(0V2), Colorado.  
1208:34   The pilot contacted Denver Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) facility via 
aircraft radio to activate the flight plan and was requested by facility specialists to refile the 
flight plan.  From the location of 24 miles south of Dove Creek, Colorado, at 9,500 feet MSL 
direct to Salida, Colorado, the estimated time of arrival was 1310. 
1211:17   Airmet sierra covered all of Colorado above 10,000 feet and VFR not recommended 
was issued to the pilot due to occasional moderate turbulence below FL200 and the possibility 
of occasional moderate mixed icing in the clouds and precipitation from 12,000 feet MSL to 
FL200. 
1239:13   During cruise at 10,500 feet MSL at 9.6 miles north of Durango, Colorado, the pilot 
contacted Denver AFSS and reported a flight deviation to the south with a change of 
destination to Alamosa, Colorado.  
1249:25   The pilot contacted Denver AFSS, reported a flight location 25 miles east of Durango, 
Colorado, and extended the arrival time to 1400.  Denver issued flight precautions for 
mountain obscurement along the route, VFR not recommended, occasional moderate 
turbulence, and the altimeter setting of 30.02.
1450:47   The pilot reported a smooth ride at 10,500 feet and the base of the clouds at 12,000.  
There were no additional communications.
Search and rescue (enclosed reports) was initiated and the airplane and occupants were located 
at 0213 on October 2, 1994. The remoteness of the site, rough terrain conditions, and darkness 
hampered the rescue.  
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION:
The airplane came to rest on a measured magnetic heading of 040 degrees at an elevation of 
11,400 feet MSL on the north slope of the canyon with the highest peak along the continental 
divide at 12,654 feet.  Trees, on a measured magnetic heading of 010 degrees, along the 35 
degree upslope of the canyon had their upper trunk areas separated and lying on the ground.  
The cockpit and cabin area remained intact.  The outboard section of the left wing separated 
from the airframe and the leading edge of both wings was crushed aft toward the main spar.  
Both fuel tanks were compromised and engine mounts separated.  One propeller blade was 
twisted and bent aft.  See the enclosed wreckage diagram for additional details.

Flight control continuity was confirmed.  Physical evidence of fuel was present at the site, fuel 
was present on the engine driven output side of the fuel pump, and the fuel selector was "ON" 
the right fuel tank.  Engine continuity was confirmed.  
TEST AND RESEARCH:
The engine was examined by a NTSB investigator on October 12, 1994, at Greeley, Colorado.  
There were no pre-impact anomalies.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
