Substantial
Defining Event:

Analysis 
THE PILOT WAS IN A HOVER AT 125 FEET AGL AND ZERO HORIZONTAL VELOCITY 
WHEN THE ENGINE QUIT. HE HAD BEEN CONDUCTING LOGGING OPERATIONS FOR 
APPROXIMATELY 40 MINUTES ON A 200 POUND FUEL LOAD. HE EXECUTED AN 
AUTOROTATION BUT LANDED HARD WITH THE HELICOPTER ROLLING OVER. THE 
PILOT REPORTED THAT HE RAN OUT OF FUEL WHILE IN THE HOVER. 
AUTOROTATION FROM 125 FEET AT ZERO AIRSPEED WAS OUTSIDE THE PARAMETERS 
OF THE AIRCRAFT'S 'HEIGHT - VELOCITY' DIAGRAM. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
FUEL EXHAUSTION, THE PILOT IN COMMAND'S FAILURE TO REFUEL THE AIRCRAFT, 
AND THE INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE AN AUTO- ROTATION LANDING 
BECAUSE OF THE LOW ALTITUDE.

Factual Information
 On April 1, 1994, approximately 1240 hours Pacific standard time (pst), a Hughes 369D, 
N5211R, registered to Rex Bailes Corp., being operated by Chet Rasberry, Inc., and being flown 
by Timothy D. Lyons, a certificated commercial rotorcraft pilot, was substantially damaged 
during a forced landing following a total power loss while in a hover near Rimrock, 
Washington. The pilot sustained minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions existed and 
no flight plan had been filed. The flight, which was concluding a long line operation, was to 
have been conducted in accordance with 14CFR133, and had departed approximately 1200 
local time with 200 pounds of fuel.
The pilot reported that while in a hover, approximately 125 feet above ground, he experienced a 
loss of power. He executed an autorotation and a hard landing followed during which the 
helicopter rolled over. The pilot reported to the operator that he had run out of gas.
A representative of the manufacturer stated that autorotations conducted from a zero airspeed 
hover of 125 feet above ground were within the "dead man's curve" area of the aircraft's 
"Height - Velocity" diagram.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
