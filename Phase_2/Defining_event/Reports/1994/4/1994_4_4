Factual Information
 On April 1, 1994, at 1354 mountain daylight time, a Piper PA-24- 260, N8961P, sustained 
substantial damge during cruise near Roswell, New Mexico.  The private pilot and the sole 
passenger did not receive injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal 
cross country flight.
Air traffic control data indicated the airplane was 35 miles southeast of Roswell, New Mexico, 
at 10,000 feet MSL en route to Albuquerque, New Mexico, when the pilot reported "severe 
downdrafts."  The airplane entered an uncontrolled altitude deviation and descent.  Recovery 
of airplane control, as reported by the pilot, was 4,400 feet MSL.  The flight diverted to 
Roswell, New Mexico, and landed without further incident.
An examination of the airplane by the pilot and a mechanic (statement enclosed) reported the 
horizontal stabilizers were bent downward.  The pilot reported that he closed the throttle as the 
speed approached the never exceed speed; however, the speed continued to increase.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
