Analysis 
The left main landing gear collapsed on landing rollout. Examination of the landing gear by the 
FAA and company maintenance personnel revealed a failure of left landing gear upper barrel 
and trunion assembly. Further examination of the components by the NTSB laboratory 
revealed fractures representative of overstress separations. There was no evidence of fatigue or 
other type of preexisting cracking. Review of aircraft logbooks revealed no recorded history of 
hard landings, or previous landing gear damage. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the left main landing gear upper barrel and trunion assembly due to overstress 
separations, resulting in the collapse of the left main landing gear on landing rollout.

Factual Information
 On November 1, 1994, about 1310 eastern standard time, a Cessna 402C, N5715C, registered to 
Airways International Inc., operating as a 14 CFR Part 135 scheduled domestic passenger flight, 
experienced a collapse of the left main landing gear on landing rollout at the Fort Lauderdale-
Hollywood International Airport, and collided with the runway lighting system. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage. The airline transport-rated pilot and two passengers reported no 
injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight plan was filed. 
The flight originated from Miami International Airport, 25 minutes before the accident.
          Examination of the landing gear by the FAA and Airways International Inc, maintenance 
personnel revealed a failure of the left main landing gear trunnion. Review of airplane logbooks 
revealed no recorded history of hard landings, or previous landing gear damage.
     Examination of pieces from the left main landing gear upper barrel and trunion assembly 
was performed by the NTSB materials laboratory. The examination revealed the fractures were 
representative of overstress separations. No evidence of fatigue or other type of preexisting 
cracking was found. (For additional information see NTSB Metallurgist's Factual Report No. 
95-17).
     Components retained for further testing were released to  Mr. Jagdesh Remkhalawam, Aero 
Parts International, Miami, Florida, on December 13, 1994.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
