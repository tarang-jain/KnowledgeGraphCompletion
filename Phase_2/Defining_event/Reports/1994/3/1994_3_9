Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
FLUSHING, NY
Accident Number:
DCA94MA038
Date & Time:
03/02/1994, 1759 EST 
Registration:
N18835
Aircraft:
MCDONNELL DOUGLAS MD-82
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
30 Minor, 86 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 121: Air Carrier - Scheduled
Analysis 
THE AIRPLANE RAN OFF THE END OF THE RUNWAY DURING A REJECTED TAKEOFF, 
COMING TO REST ON A DIKE AND A TIDAL MUD FLAT. FDR DATA CONFIRMED THAT 
THE PITOT HEAT HAD NOT BEEN SELECTED 'ON' BY THE FLIGHTCREW. A BUILDUP 
OF SNOW AND/OR ICE IN THE PITOT/STATIC SYSTEM TUBES AND PORTS RESULTED 
IN ERRONEOUS AIRSPEED READINGS DURING THE ATTEMPTED TAKEOFF. 
SUBSTANTIAL DEVIATIONS FROM CHECKLIST PROCEDURES WERE RECORDED ON 
THE CVR. 19 SECONDS ELAPSED BETWEEN THE TIME THAT THE AIRPLANE ACTUALLY 
ACCELERATED THROUGH 60 KIAS (THE FIRST MARK ON THE AIRSPEED INDICATOR) 
AND THE START OF THE REJECTED TAKEOFF. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE FAILURE OF THE FLIGHTCREW TO COMPLY WITH CHECKLIST PROCEDURES TO 
TURN ON AN OPERABLE PITOT/STATIC HEAT SYSTEM, RESULTING IN ICE AND/OR 
SNOW BLOCKAGE OF THE PITOT TUBES THAT PRODUCED ERRONEOUS AIRSPEED 
INDICATIONS, AND THE FLIGHTCREW'S UNTIMELY RESPONSE TO ANOMALOUS 
AIRSPEED INDICATIONS WITH THE CONSEQUENT REJECTION OF TAKEOFF AT AN 
ACTUAL SPEED OF 5 KNOTS ABOVE V1. (NTSB REPORT AAR-95/01)

Factual Information
 On March 2, 1994, at 1758 eastern standard time, a McDonnell Douglas  MD-80, N18835, 
operated by Continental Airlines as flight 795,  sustained substantial damage during an aborted 
takeoff at  La Guardia Airport in Flushing, New York (LGA).  Of the 116 persons  on board the 
airplane, two were flight crewmembers, four were cabin  crewmembers, and 110 were 
passengers.  There were seven minor injuries  during the accident sequence and evacuation.
A special weather observation, made about 5 minutes after the accident,  found the weather as 
drifting snow conditions, with an indefinite  ceiling at 500 feet, obscured, with the wind out of 
050 at 23 knots.
The flight was to have been from LGA to Denver Stapleton International  Airport, Colorado 
(DEN).  During the attempted takeoff on runway 13,  the first officer was at the controls.  The 
captain, seeing that the  airspeed indication was not increasing normally, but remained low,  
elected to abort by pulling back on the throttles, entering reverse  thrust , and taking control of 
the airplane.  The airplane came to  rest pitched downward, so that the nose of the airplane 
rested on a  mud flat of the Flushing Bay Tidal, which at the time of the accident,  was above 
the waterline.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
