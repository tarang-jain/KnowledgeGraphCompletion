Date & Time:

Registration:
N349SB

Part 121: Air Carrier - Scheduled
Analysis 
WHILE DESCENDING FOR LANDING AT BATON ROUGE, THE CAPTAIN ACTIVELY 
MOVED THE POWER LEVERS FROM THE FLIGHT IDLE GATE INTO THE BETA RANGE 
FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS. THE PROPELLERS AND ENGINES EXPERIENCED 
EXTREME OVERSPEED, NECESSITATING A POWER-OFF EMERGENCY LANDING AT 
NIGHT AND THE AIRPLANE RAN OFF THE END OF A 5,000-FT RUNWAY. ALTHOUGH 
THE DESIGN AND CERTIFICATION OF THE POWER LEVERS MET EXISTING 
REQUIREMENTS, THOSE REQUIREMENTS WERE INADEQUATE BECAUSE THEY 
PERMITTED A DESIGN THAT DID NOT PREVENT MOVEMENT INTO THE BETA RANGE 
IN FLIGHT. THE AIRFRAME & ENGINE INDUSTRY, THE FAA, AND THE CERTIFICATION 
AUTHORITIES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WERE SLOW IN REACTING TO SEVERAL 
PREVIOUS IN-FLIGHT BETA OCCURRENCES THAT LED TO SERIOUS INCIDENTS AND 
ACCIDENTS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE CAPTAIN'S MOVEMENT OF THE POWER LEVERS BELOW FLIGHT IDLE IN FLIGHT, 
THE INADEQUATE CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND CONSEQUENT DESIGN OF 
THE AIRPLANE'S POWER LEVERS THAT PERMITTED THEM TO BE MOVED BELOW THE 
FLIGHT IDLE POSITION INTO THE BETA RANGE, EITHER INTENTIONALLY OR 
INADVERTENTLY, WHILE IN FLIGHT, AND THE INADEQUATE ACTION TAKEN TO 
REQUIRE A POSITIVE MEANS TO PREVENT BETA OPERATION ON AIRPLANES FOR 
WHICH SUCH OPERATION IS PROHIBITED. (NTSB REPORT AAR=94/06)

Factual Information
 On February 1, 1994, at 2140 central standard time, a Saab 340B, N3495B, operated by 
Simmons Airlines as American Eagle flight 3641, sustained substantial damage during a forced 
landing at the False River Air Park in New Roads, Louisiana.  The flight had been requested to 
descend by air traffic control from FL210, into Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  The flightcrew stated 
after the accident that the captain was at the controls during the descent, and while passing 
through about 10,000 feet MSL, with the engine power levers in the flight idle position,  a 
"loud roar" was heard followed by a loss of power on both engines.  Passengers and the flight 
attendant stated that following the "roar," they observed "flames" or "sparks" coming from the 
rear of each engine.
The captain continued the descent and attempted several inflight  emergency airstarts, 
however, they were unsuccessful.  The first  officer observed the lights of an airport and 
directed the captain to the runway where he executed a dual-engine out approach.  The 
airplane touched down on runway 18 and continued off the end of the runway, accross the 
grass and a ditch, and came to rest upright on all three landing gear in a sugar cane field.
The passengers were evacuated via the airstair door.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
