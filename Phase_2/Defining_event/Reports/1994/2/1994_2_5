Factual Information
 On February 3, 1994, approximately 1721 central standard time, a Cessna T210H, N6914R, was 
destroyed during a forced landing about 8 miles northwest of the McAllen, Texas, Airport.  The 
pilot received minor injuries.  Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and an IFR 
flight plan had been filed.
The following is based on the pilot/operator report.  The pilot missed two instrument 
approaches to the Corpus Christi, Texas, Airport, so he diverted to McAllen, Texas, his 
alternate.  Shortly after intercepting the localizer course at McAllen, the engine lost power.  The 
pilot said both fuel gauges indicated 1/4 fuel in each tank.  He declared an emergency and, 
after emerging from the overcast, elected to land wheels up in an open field about 8 miles 
northwest of the airport.  He inadvertently stalled the airplane 25 feet above the ground.  The 
pilot said he had flown 4.0 hours and the airplane had an endurance of 5.5 hours.
Salvage personnel and a Federal Aviation Administration inspector who went to the site 
reported the fuel tanks had not been compromised, and there was no fuel in the tanks.  In 
addition, when the wings were demated from the fuselage, no fuel came out of the fuel lines.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
