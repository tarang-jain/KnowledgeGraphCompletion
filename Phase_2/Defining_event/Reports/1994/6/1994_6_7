Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Public Aircraft
Analysis 
DURING THE TAKEOFF ROLL, THE PILOT REPORTED A VIBRATION IN THE 
TAILWHEEL ASSEMBLY. HE CONTINUED THE TAKEOFF PROCEDURE BUT ELECTED 
TO RETURN TO THE AIRPORT FOR A PRECAUTIONARY LANDING BEFORE DISPENSING 
OR DUMPING THE 1500 POUNDS OF CHEMICALS. AT TOUCHDOWN THE TAILWHEEL 
ASSEMBLY COLLAPSED AND SEPARATED FROM THE AIRFRAME. THE PILOT LOST 
CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE AS IT SKIDDED TO A STOP ON THE RUNWAY. 
EXAMINATION OF THE AIRCRAFT FAILED TO DISCLOSE A MATERIAL FAILURE OR 
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION. ACCORDING TO THE OPERATOR, THE PILOT HAD NOT MADE 
A LANDING WITH THE AIRPLANE IN A HEAVY OR LOADED CONFIGURATION WITHIN 
THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. THE OPERATOR HAD NO FORMAL EMERGENCY 
DUMP POLICY TO PREVENT LANDING WITH CHEMICALS ONBOARD DURING AN 
EMERGENCY. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S IMPROPER LANDING FLARE WHICH RESULTED IN A HARD LANDING. A 
FACTOR WAS THE OPERATORS FAILURE TO PROVIDE A FORMAL EMERGENCY DUMP 
PROCEDURE.

Factual Information
 On June 2, 1994, at 1716 eastern daylight time, a Grumman G-164A, N9868, landed hard and 
ground looped on runway 09 at the savannah International Airport, Savannah, Georgia.  The 
public use flight operated under 14 CFR Part 91, with no flight plan filed.  Visual weather 
conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The airplane sustained substantial damage 
and the pilot was not injured.  The aerial application flight departed Savannah at 1710 hours.
According to the pilot, during the previous takeoff, he felt a vibration in the tailwheel assembly.  
He elected to continue the takeoff procedure, but returned to the airport for a precautionary 
landing.  Due to changing weather conditions at the airport, the pilot selected runway 09 for 
the landing (see attach pilot/operator aircraft accident report). During the landing attempt, the 
tailwheel broke off and was located several hundred feet west of where the airplane came to 
rest. 
Examination of the aircraft failed to disclose a mechanical problem with the airplane. The 
examination of the tailwheel assembly also failed to reveal a mechanical problem (see attached 
FAA Inspector's Statement). According to flight operation personnel from the county 
commission, they had no formal emergency dump procedure for onboard chemicals. The pilot 
elected to land with 1500 pounds of chemicals onboard. According to the same flight operation 
person, most spray missions usually ended with the complete dispensing of all chemicals. The 
pilot estimated that he had not landed with a heavy load within the last two years.

investigations. Dockets released prior to June 1, 2009 are publicly available from the NTSB™s

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
