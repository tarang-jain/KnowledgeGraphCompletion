Factual Information
 On June 1, 1994, at 1400 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Piper PA-12 airplane, 
N4380M, hit a 3-4 ft. deep trench during landing rollout, collapsing the landing gear, and 
damaging the wings and fuselage.  The personal flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91 in 
visual meteorological conditions.  The flight departed from Fairbanks and the destination was a 
sand bar on the Tanana river.  No flight plan was filed.  The Pilot in Command was uninjured.  
The aircraft was substantially damaged.
     According to the Pilot in Command, he was looking for a place to land and made two passes, 
one at 200 feet above the ground (AGL) and another at 150 AGL.  He then made two more 
passes perpendicular to the intended landing site at 50 AGL.  He stated he could see no 
obstruction.  He lined up on final and intended to do a "3 foot drag" and possibly touchdown.  
He touched down and stated the landing was smooth and he decided to brake and remain on 
the ground.  Approximately 2/3 of the way down the landing area he saw a ditch and was not 
able to execute a go around or stop before hitting the ditch.  When the airplane struck the 
ditch, the main landing gear separated from the fuselage and the airplane skidded to a stop 
while dragging its right wing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
