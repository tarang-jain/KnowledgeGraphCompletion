Analysis 
DURING TAKEOFF, THE PILOT FELT A JERK IN THE FLIGHT CONTROLS AND ELECTED 
TO ABORT THE TAKEOFF PROCEDURE AFTER THE AIRPLANE WAS AIRBORNE. 
ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT WAS MAINTAINED UNTIL 
THE AIRCRAFT ENTERED A LEFT TURN AT 40 MPH. THE AIRPLANE TOUCHED DOWN 
OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY, ROLLED OFF THE DEPARTURE END, AND 
THROUGH THE AIRPORT PERIMETER FENCE. EXAMINATION OF THE AIRPLANE 
FAILED TO DISCLOSE A MECHANICAL PROBLEM. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AIRSPEED DURING TAKEOFF.

Factual Information
 On June 2, 1994, at 1715 central daylight time, a Bellanca 8GCBC, N53819, collided with trees 
and a fence on the departure end of the south runway, during an aborted takeoff attempt from 
a private airstrip near Summerdale, Alabama. The flight operated under 14 CFR Part 91 with 
no flight plan filed. Visual weather conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The 
airplane sustained substantial damage and the pilot was not injured. The accident occurred 
during the initial takeoff attempt. 
During an attempted takeoff, the pilot felt a jerk in the flight controls and elected to abort the 
takeoff procedure after the airplane was airborne. According to the pilot, the airplane was 
controllable until the airplane entered a left turn at 40 mph. The airplane collided with a small 
stand of trees and a fence off the departure end of the runway. Examination of the airplane 
failed to disclose a mechanical problem. The pilot report that the left aileron push rod was 
broken and appeared to have jammed the flight controls. The metallurgist factual report of the 
left aileron push rod assembly stated that the examination of the assembly revealed features 
typical of a bending overstress, and there was no evidence of preexisting defects (see attached 
metallurgist's factual report). According to the operator's handbook, the airplane will stall 
between 51 and 52 mph with normal takeoff flaps and takeoff power; stall airspeed information 
in a turn was not determined, but typically the stall airspeed in a turn would be higher than 52 
mph.

investigations. Dockets released prior to June 1, 2009 are publicly available from the NTSB™s

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
