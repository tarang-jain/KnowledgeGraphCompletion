Factual Information
 On September 1, 1994, about 0641 eastern daylight time, N53184, a Cessna C-188B, registered 
to Indian River Flying Service, crashed in Indian River, Florida, while on a 14 CFR Part 137 
agricultural flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was 
filed for the local flight. The airplane was destroyed by postcrash fire and the pilot reported no 
injuries. The flight originated from New Hibiscus Airport about 10 minutes earlier.
     The pilot was en route to start applying a load of sulfur when he experienced a complete loss 
of engine power. He attempted a forced landing to a field and the airplane nosed over. After the 
pilot exited the airplane a fire consumed the airplane.
     FAA inspectors attempted to examine the engine and airplane but the airplane was 
destroyed and most of the engine accessories were consumed by fire.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
