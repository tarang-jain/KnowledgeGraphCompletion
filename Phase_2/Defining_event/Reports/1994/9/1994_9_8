AND DURING THE APPROACH TO RUNWAY 28L.  THE PILOT CANCELED HIS IFR 
FLIGHT PLAN 5 MILES FROM THE AIRPORT.  ACCORDING TO THE PILOT,'...THE 
AIRPORT WAS LOST FROM VIEW ON DOWNWIND.'  HE TURNED BASE, AND 
DESCRIBED THE TURN AS BEING MADE, '...AT A POINT WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO 
BE SOME WHAT PREMATURE IN ORDER TO REGAIN SIGHT OF THE AIRPORT.'  HE 
REGAINED SIGHT OF THE AIRPORT AFTER TURNING BASE, AND WROTE '...BUT THE 
ALTITUDE WAS PERCEIVED TO BE SLIGHTLY LOW FOR THE POSITION OF THE 
AIRCRAFT RELATIVE TO THE AIRPORT.' THE PILOT ADDED POWER, AND THE SINK 
RATE SUBSIDED. ON SHORT FINAL, AS THE AIRPLANE FLEW OVER A NORTH-SOUTH 
ORIENTED ROAD, AT THE APPROACH END OF THE RUNWAY, THE RIGHT WING TIP

Factual Information
 On September 1, 1994, about 1054 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 310Q, N7579Q, piloted by 
William McPherson, collided with a truck and a van while on final approach to the Salem 
Airpark, Salem, Ohio. The airplane was substantially damaged, the pilot and the 3 passengers 
were not injured.  There were no injures to any persons on the ground.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed, and a IFR flight plan had been filed.  The flight was operated under 14 
CFR 91.
The pilot had cancelled his IFR flight plan 5 miles from the airport.  According to the pilot's 
written statement on the NTSB Form 6120.1/2, "...the airport was lost from view on 
downwind."  He turned base, and described the turn as being made, "..at a point which was 
calculated to be some what premature in order to regain sight of the airport."  He regained 
sight of the airport after turning base, and wrote, "...but the altitude was perceived to be 
slightly low for the position of the aircraft relative to the airport."  The pilot added power, and 
the sink rate subsided.
While on short final for runway 28L, and flying over State Road (SR) 45, a north-south road, 
about 1000 feet from the approach end of the runway, the airplane struck the windshield of a 
dump truck, travelling in a southerly direction, with the right wing tip tank.  The airplane's left 
wing struck the roof of a van, in the north bound lane.  The airplane landed on a grass runway, 
the gear collapsed, and the airplane skidded on the ground coming to rest on the side of the 
runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
