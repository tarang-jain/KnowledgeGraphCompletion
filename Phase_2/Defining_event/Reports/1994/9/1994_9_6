Factual Information
 On September 1, 1994, at 1510 Pacific daylight time, a Cessna 310L, N3272X, collided with the 
ground during an attempted go- around at the Agua Dulce, California, airport.  The aircraft was 
owned and operated by West Winds Aviation, of Van Nuys, California, and was on a cross-
country business transportation flight.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time 
and no flight plan was filed.  The aircraft was destroyed in the ground collision sequence.  The 
certificated commercial pilot and two passengers were not injured; however, two passengers 
sustained minor injuries.  The flight originated at Mammoth Lakes, California, on the day of 
the accident at 1315 hours as a cross-country flight to Agua Dulce.
According to the aircraft owner, who is also a pilot, the aircraft and pilot departed Van Nuys, 
California, on the morning of the accident, stopped at Agua Dulce to pick up the owner and the 
other passengers, then proceeded to Mammoth Lakes for a business meeting.  The aircraft was 
returning the passengers to Agua Dulce when the accident happened.
The pilot and the aircraft owner both stated that there were no mechanical problems with the 
aircraft.  The pilot was on short final approach to runway 22 when the aircraft drifted right of 
the runway.  The pilot elected to do a go-around and applied full power; both the pilot and the 
aircraft owner stated that both engines responded with full power.  The pilot reached for the 
flap selector switch and the aircraft began rolling to the left.  Before the pilot could correct the 
left roll, the left wing tip collided with the ground and the aircraft cartwheeled to a stop.
The pilot stated that when he observed the windsock while on approach the wind appeared to 
be directly down the runway.  A ground witness, who is also a pilot, reported that the winds at 
the time of the accident were from 250 degrees at 15 knots, with higher gusts of unknown 
intensity.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
