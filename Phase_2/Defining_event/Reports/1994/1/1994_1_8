Analysis 
DURING PREFLIGHT THE PILOT CONFIRMED 11 QUARTS OF OIL IN THE ENGINE.  THE 
PILOT DEPARTED ON A NIGHT CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT AND CLIMBED TO A 
CRUISING ALTITUDE OF 4500 FEET.  FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTER TAKE OFF THE 
ENGINE LOST POWER.  AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT 
AFTER THE PILOT INITIATED A TURN TO RETURN TO THE DEPARTURE AIRPORT.  
THE PILOT WAS APPROACHING WATER AND ELECTED NOT TO SHUT THE ENGINE 
DOWN.  A SECOND EXPLOSION OCCURRED FOLLOWED BY A LOSS OF OIL PRESSURE.  
AFTER A THIRD EXPLOSION FOLLOWED BY FIRE ERUPTING FROM THE ENGINE 
COMPARTMENT, THE PILOT SECURED THE ENGINE AND SHUT THE FUEL OFF.  
DURING THE FORCED LANDING THE LEFT WING OF THE AIRPLANE STRUCK A TREE 
SHORT OF THE RUNWAY, AND THE AIRPLANE CAME TO REST IN A FIELD.  
EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED THAT AN EXHAUST VALVE HAD BROKEN 
FREE AND CREATED A HOLE IN THE PISTON.  THE ENGINE WAS FOUND ABSENT OF 
OIL.  TWO CONNECTING RODS FAILED AT THE CRANKSHAFT JOURNALS FROM A 
LACK OF LUBRICATION. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
an exhaust valve failure that created a hole in the piston, which allowed the complete loss of 
engine oil, resulting in the subsequent forced landing.

Factual Information
 On January 2, 1994, about 2223 eastern standard time, a Cessna 206A, N776P, piloted by 
Terry Brown, was substantially damaged during a forced landing near the Williamsburg 
Airport, Williamsburg, Virginia.  The pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed.  A visual flight rules flight plan had been filed for the flight operating under 14 CFR 
91.
    In the NTSB Form 6120.1/2, the pilot stated that during his preflight he confirmed there 
were 11 quarts of oil in the engine.  After a long warm-up due to the cold temperature, he 
departed the Williamsburg Airport (JGG) and climbed to 4500 feet.
About 15 minutes after take off, as he was preparing to file a flight plan, "...an instant decrease 
in power was noticed."
    He further stated:
     A turn was made to return to the A/P [airport] at      JGG...there was an explosion from the 
front left side      of the engine (all the flames came out there).  I was      approaching water...and 
did not want to shut down so      [I] kept engine on line,  30-45 seconds later a second      
explosion took place, this time fire came out right      front and oil pressure was lost.  I still 
needed      whatever I would get and kept the engine operating.       The cockpit filled with 
smoke and the third explosion      took place with fire coming out of the engine      
compartment.  I secured the engine and fuel...I was not      going to make the A/P, but 
remembered a road south west      of JGG, and...set up a pattern, and landed.  Evading      wires 
on short final I dodged the tree on the      right...over input left aileron and put the left wing      
into a tree...and ended up going backward nose-low."
    An engine examination was performed by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
Inspector and a representative of Teledyne Continental Motors on January 11, 1994, at the JGG 
Airport.  The Teledyne representative report stated:
     The engine failure was induced by the failure of the #2      cylinder exhaust valve.  This valve 
dropped into the      cylinder and the severe hammering opened a hole in the      piston.  
Combustion gases evacuated the oil through the      breather and the #4 and #5 connecting rods 
failed at      the crankshaft journals after lubrication failure.  The      relative damage to the 
connecting rods suggest the      connecting rod of the #5 cylinder (right front) failed      first 
followed by the connecting rod of the #4 cylinder      (middle left)...The exhaust valve, which 
may have been      replaced at an engine overhaul 440 hours earlier, was a      Superior valve,

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
