Factual Information
 On January 3, 1994, at 1230 hours Pacific standard time, a Beech 76, N8013Y, collided with 
wires after departing runway 22 about 7 miles south of Catalina Airport (AVX), Avalon, 
California.  The pilot declared an emergency and returned to AVX and landed without further 
incident.  The pilot was beginning a visual flight rules personal flight to Torrance, California.  
The airplane, operated by Rolling Hills Aviation, Torrance, California, sustained substantial 
damage.  A small fire erupted from the falling electrical wires, but was quickly extinguished by 
fire-fighting personnel.  The certificated commercial pilot and his two passengers sustained 
minor injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The pilot submitted a Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report, NTSB Form 6120.1/2, but he 
did not make any statement regarding the facts, conditions, and circumstances relating to the 
accident.  
Mr. Edward Mays, aviation safety inspector (airworthiness), Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA), Long Beach [California] Flight Standards District Office, conducted the on-scene 
investigation.  Inspector Mays reported that shortly after the accident airplane departed the 
airport the pilot declared an emergency.  The airplane landed on runway 22 with substantial 
damage.
Inspector Mays inspection of the airplane revealed major damage from "...wire strikes...."  "The 
left wing tip was missing and the outer leading edge was torn open and the left aileron was 
damaged.  The right wing was missing a 2 x 2.5 foot portion of the wing outboard of the fuel 
tank.  The right aileron was damaged.  There was evidence of wire damage across the aircraft 
wings, cowling, propellers, and lower antenna.  The center portion of the wind screen was 
broken approximately 2 x 1.5 feet."  
Inspector Mays reported that Mr. Cecil Andrews, Southern California Edison Company, 
reported that the wires spanned 1,000 feet from ridge to ridge on 40 foot poles.  The airplane 
contacted the wires about 180 feet above the ground.
The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department submitted their investigation report to the Safety Board.  
The investigating deputy reported that the pilot said he did not have his pilot or medical 
certificate with him; the certificates were in his automobile.  He also said that he had flown to 
AVX for lunch with his two cousins.  
When questioned by the deputy concerning the events of the accident, the pilot said that after 
departing runway he turned to the south and "...flew low between the saddle of Mt. Orizaba 
and Mt. Banning...."  He then turned right and angled toward Sweetwater Canyon at an altitude 
below the ridge line toward the ocean.  While flying low through the canyon the pilot heard a 
"...very loud noise and realized the top half of the windshield had broke and been blown into 
the cockpit..."   
The pilot was able to maintain control of the airplane and returned to the airport.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
