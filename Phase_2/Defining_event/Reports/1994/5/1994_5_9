Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot completed the preflight inspection of the aircraft and loaded his passengers on board. 
The aircraft had been idle for about a month. On the first start attempt, the engine turned over 
very slowly and the pilot discontinued the start cycle. The pilot got out of the aircraft to pull the 
propeller through several revolutions and, as he did so, the engine suddenly started and went 
to a high power setting. The pilot said he tried to get back into the cockpit, but he had trouble 
with the door latch. The pilot next attempted to restrain the aircraft by holding the tail, but he 
was knocked to the ground in the effort. The aircraft ran into a hangar, bending a wing spar. 
The pilot said that on reflection he believes that he forgot to turn off the magnetos completely 
before trying to turn the propeller through the revolutions. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to ensure that the magneto switch was in the off position prior to rotating the 
propeller by hand.

Occurrence #1: ON GROUND/WATER COLLISION WITH OBJECT
Phase of Operation: STANDING - STARTING ENGINE(S)
Findings
1. OBJECT - BUILDING(NONRESIDENTIAL)

Factual Information
 On May 1, 1994, at 1430 mountain standard time, a Cessna 182P, N1454S, collided with a 
hangar at the Deer Valley Airport, Phoenix, Arizona.  The aircraft ran away from the pilot after 
the engine inadvertently started while the pilot was pulling the propeller through several 
compression cycles.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan 
was filed for the operation.  The airplane incurred substantial wing damage.  The certificated 
private pilot incurred minor injuries; however, the two passengers on board the aircraft were 
not injured.  The flight was originating at the time of the accident as a personal cross-country 
flight to Tucson, Arizona.
In a verbal statement, the pilot reported that he had completed the preflight inspection of the 
aircraft and loaded his passengers on board.  The aircraft had been idle for about a month.  On 
the first start attempt, the engine turned over very slowly and the pilot discontinued the start 
cycle.  The pilot got out of the aircraft to pull the propeller through several revolutions and, as 
he did so, the engine suddenly started and went to a high power setting.  The pilot said he tried 
to get back into the cockpit, but he had trouble with the door latch.  The pilot next attempted to 
restrain the aircraft by holding the tail, but he was knocked to the ground in the effort.  The 
aircraft ran into a hangar, bending a wing spar.
During his statement, the pilot said that on reflection he believes that he forgot to turn off the 
magnetos completely before trying to turn the propeller through the revolutions.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
