Factual Information
 On May 1, 1994, about 1545 eastern daylight time, a Hesterlee  Rutan Vari Eze, N41ES, 
collided with the ground during a  forced landing at Statesville, North Carolina. The airplane  
was operated by the pilot under 14 CFR Part 91, and visual  flight rules. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed.  A flight plan was not filed for the personal flight. there  were no injuries 
to the private pilot, and the airplane was  substantially damaged. The flight was originating at 
the  time of the accident.
The pilot believed that he inadvertently turned the fuel  selector from the auxiliary tankposition 
to the off  position, instead of the main fuel tank position.  During the initial climb after takeoff, 
the engine quit.  A forced landing was attempted which resulted in a collision with a ditch, as 
the pilot tried to re-land on the runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
