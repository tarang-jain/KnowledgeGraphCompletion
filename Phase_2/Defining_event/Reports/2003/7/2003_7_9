Memphis, TN
Accident Number:
ATL03FA115
Date & Time:

Registration:
N36TL
Aircraft:
Beech 58P
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Fatal, 2 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane was on approach to runway 36R and had descended to approximately 10 to 15 feet 
above the runway. A witness reported the airplane then yawed left, rolled left, and collided with 
the ground inverted. Examination of the airframe, engines, and propellers revealed no 
evidence of mechanical malfunction. Both propellers exhibited twisting of the blades and chord 
wise gouges, and each propeller low pitch stop displayed an impression mark. Target 
separation analysis of the radar data for the accident airplane's approach to runway 36R 
showed that an Embraer ERJ 145 landed on runway 36C approximately 120 seconds before the 
accident airplane attempted to land on runway 36R. The last recorded horizontal separation 
between the two airplanes was 3.53 nautical miles. Radar data, wind data, and wake vortex 
characteristics were utilized to develop a ground track and wake vortex profile for the two 
airplanes. According to the study, "the wake vortex of the ... [Embraer ERJ 145] ... could have 
migrated toward the ... [Beech 58P's] flight path." The study also states, "[Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA)] ... guidance suggests that a separation of 120 sec[onds] is sufficient for 
the wake to dissipate or move away from the runway. Furthermore, wake dissipation is 
enhanced in ground effect." According to FAA guidelines, for purposes of wake turbulence 
separation, runways 36R and 36C are considered as a single runway because of their proximity 
to each other, and the separation minima for a "small" aircraft (Beech 58P) following a "large" 
aircraft (Embraer ERJ 145) is four miles.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
An encounter with wake turbulence on approach, which resulted in the pilot's inability to 
maintain control and subsequent in-flight collision with the ground.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On July 2, 2003, at 1005 central daylight time, a Beech 58P, N36TL, registered to private 
owners and co-owned and operated by the private pilot, collided with the ground during 
approach to land at the Memphis International Airport, Memphis, Tennessee. The personal 
flight was operated under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91 with an instrument flight plan 
filed. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed. The private pilot and the front-seated 
passenger received fatal injuries, the two passengers seated in the second row received serious 
injuries, and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The flight departed Peter O. Knight 
Airport, Tampa, Florida, about 0758 eastern daylight time on July 2, 2003.
A review of air traffic control data revealed the flight was inbound from the southeast when the 
pilot contacted the Memphis Air Traffic Control Arrival Final East controller at 0954:55 and 
reported the flight was at 4,000 feet mean sea level (MSL). The controller stated the pilot could 
expect the ILS runway 36R approach, the pilot acknowledged, and the controller subsequently 
cleared the flight to descend and maintain 3,000 feet MSL. At 0958:11, the controller 
instructed the pilot to reduce speed to 170 knots, and the pilot acknowledged. The controller 
then stated, "... caution wake turbulence when on final you'll be operating four miles in trail of 
an e one forty five," and the pilot acknowledged. A review of radar data revealed an Embraer 
ERJ 145 regional jet was on approach to runway 36C, approximately four miles north of the 
pilot's position. At 0959:46, the controller provided the pilot a vector to join the localizer for 
runway 36R and instructed him to reduce speed to 160 knots. The pilot acknowledged, and the 
controller cleared the flight for the ILS runway 36R approach. At 1000:47, the controller 
stated, "... caution wake turbulence contact tower ...," and the pilot acknowledged . The pilot 
contacted the Memphis Air Traffic Control Local Two controller, and at 1000:59, the controller 
cleared the flight to land on runway 36R. The pilot acknowledged, and no further radio 
communication was received from the flight. 
A witness in an airplane taxiing southbound between runways 36R and 36C observed the 
accident airplane on final approach. The witness stated the airplane descended to 
approximately 10 to 15 feet above the runway on 36R, and it "had the runway made." The 
witness stated the airplane then simultaneously and slowly yawed left and rolled left, and he 
stated he thought it looked like the pilot might be trying to make "a last minute play for the 
other runway." The witness stated the airplane then pitched up approximately 15-degrees, and 
then abruptly "snap rolled" to the left. He stated the airplane's left wing barely cleared runway, 
and the airplane "pancaked" onto the ground inverted. Another witness in an observation 
tower west of the runway reported the airplane appeared to be positioned off the left side of the 
runway during the approach, and it appeared to nose straight down toward the ground while 
turning to the left. Both witnesses stated they did not see any other airplanes on the ground 
near the approach areas of the runways.  
The passenger seated in the second row right-side seat of the accident airplane stated the 
airplane approached the runway. The passenger looked down inside the airplane during the 
approach. He stated that when he looked back out the window, he could see the runway off to 
the right side of the airplane, that the airplane had turned. He stated the next thing he 
remembered was hearing the airplane hit the ground.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
The six-seat Beech 58P was manufactured in 1981 and was powered by two Teledyne 
Continental TSIO-520-WB, 325-horsepower engines. A review of maintenance logbooks for the 
airplane revealed a major overhaul was completed on the left engine February 8, 2001, and on 
the right engine March 6, 2001. The overhauled engines were installed on the airframe April 9, 
2001. Each engine was equipped with a Hartzell PHC-J3YF-2UF propeller with three 
FC7663DR blades. A review of maintenance records revealed an overhaul of each propeller was 
completed July 3, 2002. The maintenance records revealed an annual inspection of the 
airplane was completed July 17, 2002 at a hobbs meter time of 707 hours; a 50-hour inspection 
was completed February 27, 2003, at a left engine time of 157 hours since major overhaul, a 
right engine time of 158 hours since major overhaul, and hobbs meter time of 815. The hobbs 
meter at the accident site displayed 0880.6 hours.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
The Memphis International Airport Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) reported at 
0953 wind 290 degrees at 5 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, sky condition scattered at 3,000 
feet and broken at 3,800 feet above ground level (AGL), temperature 27 degrees centigrade, 
dew point 21 degrees centigrade, altimeter setting 29.95 inches. Reported conditions at 1013 
were wind 330 degrees at 5 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, sky condition broken at 2,900 feet 
AGL, broken 3,800 feet AGL, and broken 4,500 feet AGL; temperature 26 degrees centigrade, 
dew point 21 degrees centigrade, altimeter setting 29.95 inches.
Examination of upper air data retrieved from two aircraft that arrived at Memphis 
International Airport within 20 minutes of the accident airplane revealed the data were 
consistent with the data reported by the ASOS station. The low-level wind and temperature 
information from the two aircraft and the ASOS station showed no evidence of significant 
directional shear or speed shear, and no evidence of instability.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
Examination of the accident site revealed the airplane was found inverted in a grassy area 
between runways 36C and 36R, north of the S1 taxiway. Wreckage debris was scattered on an 
approximate 310-degree magnetic heading along a path 187 feet long and 57 feet wide. The 
debris path originated on the S1 taxiway west of runway 36R in an area where paint smears, 
debris, and two series of slash marks were observed on the concrete. Fuel was observed leaking 
from the fuel tanks, and approximately 40 to 50 gallons of fuel was recovered by airport 
emergency response personnel. The main and nose landing gear were in the extended and 
locked position.
Examination of the fuselage revealed the top of nose compartment was crushed, the cabin roof 
Page 5 of 10ATL03FA115
was crushed inward to the cockpit, the windscreen was fragmented and separated, and the 
fuselage forward of the wing roots was buckled and displaced downward approximately 25 
degrees. Dirt and grass were embedded in the cabin roof and the windscreen area. The 
empennage and wings were attached to the fuselage. The instrument panel was crushed, the 
cockpit flight control yokes were attached and free to move, and the rudder pedals were 
attached and free to move. The control console was damaged and displaced with the 
powerplant control levers free to move; the propeller levers were approximately mid-range, the 
throttle levers were slightly aft of mid-range with the "go around" button on the left throttle 
lever dislodged, and the mixture levers were approximately mid-range. 
The right wing was attached to the fuselage, and the engine and nacelle were separated. The 
right wing 88 inches outboard of the root was crushed from the leading edge aft and bent 
downward from that location outboard to the tip. The leading edge displayed fore-to-aft gouges 
and scratches through the de-ice boot and the paint. The upper surface of the wing tip was 
separated at the rivet line and attached to the wing by the lower skin panels. The flap and 
aileron were attached to wing, and control continuity was established from control surfaces to 
the cockpit controls. The flap was in the 30-degrees down position.
The left wing was attached to the fuselage, and the engine and nacelle were attached. The left 
wing was scratched and damaged on the upper skin of the wing tip and on top of the engine 
nacelle, and dirt and grass were embedded in the wing tip. The underside of the wing skin 
showed a series of 45-degree wrinkles across the surface from the wing spar to the trailing 
edge. The flap, aileron, and aileron trim tab were attached, and control continuity was 
established from the control surfaces to the cockpit controls. The flap was in the 30-degrees 
down position.
The top of vertical stabilizer and rudder were crushed with dirt and grass embedded, and the 
rudder was separated from the upper and middle hinges. The bottom of the rudder was 
attached to the rudder horn, and the rudder trim tab was attached. The right and left sides of 
the horizontal stabilizer were attached, and the right and left elevators and trim tabs were 
attached. Control continuity was established from the rudder, elevator, and trim control 
surfaces to the cockpit controls. 
The left engine was found with the propeller assembly separated from the crankshaft flange, 
and the flange was bent. The aft side of the oil sump was damaged, and the No. 6 cylinder head, 
fins, and valve cover were damaged. The exhaust system was attached, and the turbocharger 
was free of obstruction. Examination of the engine revealed compression developed on all six 
cylinders when the crankshaft was rotated; movement of all valves and movement of the 
accessory drive gears were observed. The vacuum pump was attached, the shear drive was 
intact, and the pump vanes rotated when turned at the drive. The magnetos were removed for 
examination, and both magnetos produced spark through all leads when rotated. Examination 
of the top spark plugs revealed deposits and wear consistent with the "normal" condition on 
the Champion AV-27 comparison chart for massive electrode plugs. The fuel manifold valve, 
fuel injector lines, and the Nos. 2, 5, and 6 fuel injector nozzles were damaged. The throttle 
arm, mixture arm, and link rod were intact on the fuel servo. Fuel was observed in the fuel 
pump, and the pump functioned when rotated.
The right engine was found with the propeller assembly attached. The accessory section was 
damaged. The exhaust system was attached, and the turbocharger was damaged and free of 
obstruction. Examination of the engine revealed compression developed on all six cylinders 
Page 6 of 10ATL03FA115
when the crankshaft was rotated; movement of all valves and movement of the accessory drive 
gears were observed. The vacuum pump was separated, the shear drive was intact, and pump 
vanes rotated when turned at the drive. The magnetos were removed for examination. The Nos. 
1, 3, and 5 ignition leads were damaged, the Nos. 1, 3, and 5 top spark plugs were damaged, and 
the right magneto case was fractured. The right magneto could not be rotated, and the left 
magneto produced spark on all towers when rotated. Examination of the top spark plugs 
revealed deposits and wear consistent with the "normal" condition on the Champion AV-27 
comparison chart for massive electrode plugs. The Nos. 1, 3, and 5 fuel injector nozzles and 
lines were damaged. The fuel servo was fractured. Fuel was observed in the fuel pump, and the 
pump functioned when rotated.
The left propeller blades were present in the hub, and the spinner dome was attached. The 
spinner dome was dented, and the front and one side were crushed and scraped. Examination 
of the left propeller assembly revealed the pitch change rod was bent between the fork and 
piston, and the rod displayed a mark 9 5/8 inches from the aft end of the rod consistent with 
contact with the hole in the front hub half. The mark was measured at a location consistent 
with the blades at approximately 14.3 degrees blade angle. According to installation data for 
the propeller, low pitch is 15.3 +/- 0.1 degrees. The low pitch stop displayed an impression 
mark, and the feather pitch stop and the start locks were intact with no abnormalities. Two 
blades were twisted with spiral bending and were bent aft approximately 70 degrees, and the 
third blade was bent and twisted. All three blades had chordwise gouges on the camber side of 
the blade. 
The right propeller blades were present in the hub, and the spinner dome was attached. The 
spinner dome was crushed and scraped on one side. Examination of the right propeller 
assembly revealed the pitch change rod displayed a mark 9 1/2 inches from the aft end of the 
rod consistent with contact with the hole in the front hub half. The mark was measured at a 
location consistent with the blades at approximately 16.3 degrees blade angle. According to 
installation data for the propeller, low pitch is 15.3 +/- 0.1 degrees. The low pitch stop 
displayed an impression mark, and the feather pitch stop and the start locks were intact with 
no abnormalities. One blade was twisted with spiral bending, and the other two blades were 
twisted. All three blades had chordwise gouges on the camber side of the blade. 
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
An autopsy was performed on the pilot by the Office of the County Medical Examiner, Shelby 
County, Memphis, Tennessee, on July 3, 2003. The report stated the cause of death was 
"injuries ... as a result of direct blunt trauma." Forensic toxicology was performed on 
specimens from the pilot by the Federal Aviation Administration Bioaeronautical Sciences 
Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The report stated no carbon monoxide and 
no cyanide were detected in the blood, and no ethanol and no drugs were detected in the urine.
TESTS AND RESEARCH
Runway 36R is 9,000 feet long and 150 feet wide with a threshold elevation of 335 feet above 
mean sea level (MSL). Runway 36C is 11,120 feet long and 150 feet wide with a threshold 
elevation of 341 feet MSL. The runways are 972 feet apart, and their thresholds are parallel at 
the same latitude.
Examination of radar data revealed runways 36R and 36C were active for inbound aircraft at 
the time of the accident. Radar data for aircraft landing on both runways during the 20 
Page 7 of 10ATL03FA115
minutes prior to the accident were examined. The last recorded radar returns for aircraft 
landing on each runway showed each aircraft aligned with the approach end of the respective 
landing runway at the Mode C altitude of 500 feet MSL.  
On runway 36R, the accident airplane's last radar return was observed at 1004:47. Radar data 
showed the two previous aircraft to land on runway 36R were both Airbus Industrie A306 
airplanes, of which the last radar returns were observed at 0950:42 and 0946:52, respectively. 
On runway 36C, the three aircraft to land previous to the time of the accident were an Embraer 
ERJ 145, an Embraer ERJ 135, and a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, of which the last radar returns 
were observed at 1002:48, 1001:09, and 0953:28, respectively.
Target separation analysis of the radar data for the Beech 58P approach to 36R and the 
Embraer ERJ 145 approach to runway 36C showed at 1001:53, the Beech 58P was at an 
altitude of 2,500 feet MSL, the Embraer ERJ 145 was at an altitude of 1,100 feet MSL, and the 
horizontal separation between the two airplanes was 4.02 nautical miles. At 1002:48 (the time 
of the last recorded radar position for the Embraer ERJ 145), the Beech 58P was at an altitude 
of 1,700 feet MSL, the Embraer ERJ 145 was at an altitude of 500 feet MSL, and the horizontal 
separation between the two airplanes was 3.53 nautical miles.   
The National Transportation Safety Board, Office of Research and Engineering, Washington, 
D. C., utilized the radar data, wind data, and wake vortex characteristics to develop a ground 
track and wake vortex profile for the Embraer ERJ 145 and the Beech 58P in a Study of Wake 
Vortex Encounter. According to the study, "the wake vortex of the ... [Embraer ERJ 145], in 
particular the right wing tip (downwind counterclockwise rotating) vortex, could have migrated 
toward the ... [Beech 58P's] flight path. An airplane's typical response to a counterclockwise 
rotating wake vortex would be a roll to the left ... ." The study also states, "The possibility that 
the wake vortex had dissipated ... was also explored. [Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)] 
... guidance suggests that a separation of 120 sec[onds] is sufficient for the wake to dissipate or 
move away from the runway. Furthermore, wake dissipation is enhanced in ground effect."  
According to the FAA Advisory Circular 90-23F, "Aircraft Wake Turbulence," "Flight tests have 
shown that the vortices from larger (transport category) aircraft sink at a rate of several 
hundred feet per minute, slowing their descent and diminishing in strength with time and 
distance behind the generating aircraft."
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
According to the definitions for "Aircraft Classes - For the purposes of Wake Turbulence 
Separation Minima" outlined in the Pilot/Controller Glossary in FAA Order 7110-65P Air 
Traffic Control, the Beech 58P is classified as "small," and the Embraer ERJ 145 is classified as 
"large."   
FAA Order 7110-65P Air Traffic Control states in Section 5-5-4, Minima, Wake Turbulence 
Application: "f. TERMINAL. ... separate an aircraft landing behind another aircraft on the 
same runway ... by ensuring the following minima will exist at the time the preceding aircraft is 
over the landing threshold: NOTE - Consider parallel runways less than 2,500 feet apart as a 
single runway because of the possible effects of wake turbulence. 1. Small behind large - 4 
miles."
The wreckage was released to a representative of International Loss Management, Inc., on 
February 26, 2004.
