Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Belle Glade, FL
Accident Number:
MIA03LA138
Date & Time:
07/01/2003, 1505 EDT 
Registration:
N82120
Aircraft:
WSK PZL Mielec M-18A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot stated that during the takeoff roll from the hard-packed rock road used as a runway, 
the right main landing gear tire blew.  He applied left rudder input and slight left brake, but the 
airplane veered to the right, off the road onto soft sand/muck, and the airplane then nosed 
over.  He further reported that the tire blew when the airplane was traveling about 70 mph, 
which was too slow to fly and too fast to stop before nosing over.  The right main landing gear 
tire had been replaced in May 2003, and it had accumulated approximately 84 hours in 
service.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The inability of the pilot to maintain directional control of the airplane following a blown right 
main landing gear tire during the takeoff roll, resulting in the airplane rolling into soft terrain 
and subsequent nose over.  A factor in the accident was the pilot's delay in reducing power 
immediately after the blown tire.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
