Analysis 
The pilot said they were capturing bighorn sheep with a net canon.  He said he was pursuing a 
group of animals up rising terrain (11,200 feet) when his rotor speed began to deteriorate.  He 
tried to turn the helicopter around, but hit the ground breaking the helicopter's right skid.  
Subsequently, the aircraft rolled over onto its right side, and its main rotor blades separated 
from the helicopter.   The density altitude at the time of the accident was calculated to be 
13,068 feet.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the failure of the pilot-in-command to maintain clearance from terrain.  Factors include the 
high density altitude and the pilot-in-command's improper in-flight planning.

Factual Information
On April 2, 2003, at approximately 1620 mountain standard time, a Hughes 369D helicopter, 
N56SM,  was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain during a reversal maneuver near

injured.  Aris Helicopters of San Jose, California, was operating the flight under Title 14 CFR 
Part 91.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local, animal capture flight that 
originated at approximately 1530 from a forward staging area.  The pilot had not filed a flight 
plan.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
