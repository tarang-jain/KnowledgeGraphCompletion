Factual Information
On November 1, 2003, at 0752 mountain standard time, a Fairchild Swearingen SA227BC, 
N787KL, operated by Key Lime Air, was substantially damaged after striking a snow bank 
while landing at Rawlins Municipal Airport (RWL), Rawlins, Wyoming. The commercial pilot, 
the sole occupant on board, was not injured. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed. 
The non-scheduled domestic cargo flight was being conducted under the provisions of Title 14 
CFR Part 135. An IFR flight plan had been filed for the flight that originated from Denver 
International Airport, Denver, Colorado, at approximately 0640.
According to the accident report submitted by the pilot, he was circling to land on runway 22 
after executing the NDB-A approach. During the circling approach, the pilot noted that the 
runway was snow covered. During the landing roll, the airplane began to slide to the left. The 
pilot applied right rudder and reversed the right propeller. The airplane slid for approximately 
1,900 feet and went  off the left side of the runway. The airplane struck a snow bank, wrinkling 
and bending the airplane's nose section. An examination of the airplane's systems revealed no 
anomalies.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
