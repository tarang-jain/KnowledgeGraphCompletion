Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Skwentna, AK
Accident Number:
ANC03LA048
Date & Time:
05/03/2003, 1200 AKD 
Registration:
N8240P
Aircraft:
Piper PA-18-160
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported he was operating the airplane about 100 feet above the ground when he 
initiated a downwind turn.  He said that during the turn, the airplane encountered a 
downdraft, which pushed the airplane closer to the ground.  He immediately applied full 
power, but the engine did not appear to produce full power, and the airplane continued to 
descend.  He said due to the airplane's low altitude, he was unable to select a better landing 
area than a nearby frozen river.  The airplane landed hard on the ice, damaging the wings, 
fuselage, and landing gear.  The pilot indicated that he believed that the engine did not produce 
full power due to carburetor ice, which had accumulated since he had been operating the 
engine at a reduced power setting without carburetor heat.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to use carburetor heat, which resulted in the accumulation of carburetor ice, 
a partial loss of engine power, and a subsequent forced landing.  Factors contributing to the 
accident are a downdraft, the pilot operating the airplane at a low altitude, the presence of 
carburetor icing conditions, and the lack of suitable terrain for a forced landing.

Factual Information
On May 3, 2003, about 1200 Alaska daylight time, a wheel-equipped Piper PA-18-160 airplane, 
N8240P, sustained substantial damage when it collided with the frozen surface of a river 
during a forced landing following a partial loss of engine power.  The accident occurred about 
80 miles northwest of Skwentna, Alaska.  The airline transport certificated pilot and the sole 
passenger were not injured.  The Title 14, CFR Part 91 personal flight operated in day visual 
meteorological conditions without a flight plan.  The flight departed from an airstrip near 
Wasilla, Alaska, about 1030, and the destination was the area of the accident site.
The pilot contacted the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC) on May 7.  He related that he and a 
passenger were on a pleasure flight, and that he had been flying about 100 feet above the 
ground at a reduced power setting.  He said he had initiated a 90 degree downwind turn, and 
hit a "sinker," which pushed the airplane towards the ground.  He immediately applied full 
power, but the engine did not seem to respond with maximum power.  The pilot indicated he 
did not have sufficient altitude to select a more desirable forced landing spot other than the 
frozen river nearby.  He said he leveled the wings, and the airplane hit hard on the ice,  
damaging the fuselage, wings, and landing gear.  When asked by the IIC if he was aware of why 
the engine did not seem to respond with maximum power, the pilot stated that he thought the 
engine had accumulated carburetor ice since he had been flying at a reduced power setting 
without the application of carburetor heat.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
