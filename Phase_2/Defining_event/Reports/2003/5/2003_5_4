Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Roanoke, TX
Accident Number:
FTW03LA143
Date & Time:
05/03/2003, 1500 CDT 
Registration:
N9789D
Aircraft:
Piper PA-18A-150
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
During the takeoff climb of the 3rd or 4th touch and go, "the engine lost power and began to 
sputter."  Prior to the flight, according to the cockpit fuel sight gauges observed by the private 
pilot, the left fuel tank indicated approximately 3/4 full of fuel, and the right tank indicated 
approximately 1/2 full of fuel.  The private pilot, who was receiving instruction for a tailwheel 
endorsement, stated the fuel selector was selected to the left fuel tank at the time the engine 
lost power.  After the engine lost power, the flight instructor initiated a forced landing to a 
field.  During the forced landing, the airplane impacted trees and terrain, and came to rest on 
its nose.  Examination of the airplane revealed the fuel system was intact, the left main fuel 
tank was empty, the right main fuel tank contained "plenty of fuel," and the fuel was clear of 
contaminants.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's inadequate in-flight planning/decision resulting in fuel starvation and 
the loss of engine power.  A contributing factor was the lack of suitable terrain for the forced 
landing.

Factual Information
On May 3, 2003, at 1500 central daylight time, a Piper PA-18A-150 single-engine tailwheel-
equipped airplane, N9789D, sustained substantial damage during a forced landing following a 
loss of engine power during takeoff climb, while executing touch and go landings from the 
Northwest Regional Airport, near Roanoke, Texas.  The certified flight instructor (CFI) was not 
injured, and the private pilot receiving instruction sustained minor injuries.  The airplane was 
registered to Land Aviation LLC, of Argyle, Texas, and operated by Marcair, of Roanoke, Texas.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a flight plan was not filed for the 14 Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.  The local flight departed Northwest Regional 
Airport approximately 1425.
The 260-hour private pilot was receiving a checkout for a tailwheel endorsement.  The private 
pilot reported that prior to the flight, according to the cockpit fuel sight gauges, the left fuel 
tank indicated approximately 3/4 full of fuel, and the right tank indicated approximately 1/2 
full of fuel.  During the takeoff climb of the 3rd or 4th touch and go, "the engine lost power and 
began to sputter."  The private pilot stated that the fuel selector was selected to the left fuel 
tank at the time the engine lost power.  After the engine began to lose power, the CFI switched 
the fuel selector to the right tank position; however, no change in engine power was noted, and 
the CFI initiated a forced landing to a field.  During the forced landing, the airplane impacted 
trees and terrain, and came to rest on its nose.
An FAA inspector, who responded to the accident site, reported that the right wing and the 
fuselage sustained structural damage.  The FAA inspector stated that the fuel system was 
intact, the left main fuel tank was empty, the right main fuel tank contained "plenty of fuel," 
and the fuel was clear of contaminants.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
