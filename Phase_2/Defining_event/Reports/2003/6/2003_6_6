Factual Information
On June 1, 2003, about 1032 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 172N, N9758G, registered to Four 
Fox Air Inc., and operated by an individual, impacted with an airport sign during the takeoff 
roll at the St. Petersburg/Clearwater International Airport, Clearwater, Florida.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for the 14 CFR Part 
91 personal flight.  The airplane was substantially damaged.  The private-rated pilot-in-
command and three passengers reported no injuries.  The flight was originating at the time.
According to the pilot he was departing runway 22, had started the takeoff roll, and the 
airspeed indicator had just started to move, when the airplane started to yaw to the left.  He 
applied right rudder, but the airplane continued to the left, departed the runway and impacted 
with an airport sign.
According to the FAA inspector, during an interview with the pilot, the pilot told him that he 
did not recall why the airplane yawed to the left, even after applying full right rudder.  The 
inspector stated that an inspection of the brakes and the rudder cables revealed that they all 
checked out "satisfactory."  In addition, the inspector stated that the pilot was 5 feet 3 inches 
tall, and that the seat may not have been close enough to get full deflection of the pedal.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
