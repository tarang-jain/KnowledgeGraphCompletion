Analysis   
The pilot stated he was positioning the helicopter to have the sole passenger take a photograph 
of an animal and a settling with power condition occurred. The pilot stated that a gust of wind 
came from a nearby hill and began to push the helicopter toward the ground so the pilot 
conducted a running landing to an open field. During the landing, the pilot reported that the 
helicopter struck an anthill and rolled sideways. The helicopter sustained substantial damage 
to the tail boom. 
The pilot verified that there were no pre-impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=90977
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
