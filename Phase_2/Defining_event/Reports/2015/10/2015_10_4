Substantial

2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The student pilot reported that on his first night training flight he was practicing takeoffs and 
landings. He stated that during his third approach, as he was turning from base to final, the 
precision approach path indicator (PAPI) displayed four red lights, indicating that he was 
below the recommended approach path. The flight instructor told him that he was too low and 
to add power. The student pilot added power and the far left PAPI light started to turn from red 
to white. He reported that on short final, he reduced engine power to idle and that during 
touchdown, the airplane collided with a runway threshold light. The airplane sustained 
substantial damage to horizontal stabilizer spar.
The flight instructor reported no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's failure to correct the student pilot's approach path during the final 
approach, which resulted in a collision with runway threshold lights. Contributing to the 
accident was the student pilot's failure to attain and maintain the recommended approach 
path.

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=92147
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
