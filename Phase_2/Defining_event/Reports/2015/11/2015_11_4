Analysis   
The student pilot reported that he was performing a touch and go and his landing was 
"normal." As he applied power for takeoff, the airplane veered to the left and he responded by 
applying right rudder. The airplane continued to the left, departed the runway, and collided 
with a bush which caused the left main landing gear to collapse. The fuselage and left elevator 
sustained substantial damage.
The pilot stated there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's loss of directional control during takeoff, which resulted in a runway 
excursion, left main landing gear collapse, and a collision with terrain.
Findings

Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
