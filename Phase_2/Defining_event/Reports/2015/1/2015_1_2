Registration:
N2841N

2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot stated that he landed at a private airstrip earlier in the day and was departing with 
the intention of returning to his home airstrip. Prior to departure, he noted a left crosswind of 
about 15 mph. The initial phase of the takeoff was normal, and when becoming airborne, the 
wind lifted the left wing and the airplane drifted right over the adjacent field. The field was at a 
lower elevation, and with the loss of ground effect, the airplane sank resulting in the tail wheel 
colliding with the ground. Thereafter, the main landing gear impacted an irrigation pipe and 
the airplane flipped over inverted. During the accident sequence the airplane sustained 
substantial damage to both wings. 
The pilot further stated that the accident could have been prevented if they had waited for the 
wind to have subsided and/or performed the takeoff with the wing flaps extended. 
The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to compensate for crosswind conditions during takeoff, which resulted in the 
loss of directional control and collision with terrain.
Findings
Aircraft
Crosswind correction - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Crosswind - Effect on operation

Note:

to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=90556
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
