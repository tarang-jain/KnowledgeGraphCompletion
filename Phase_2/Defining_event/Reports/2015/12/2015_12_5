Registration:
N97537

STINSON 108
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Runway excursion
Injuries:
1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that during the landing roll on a rough grass private strip, the airplane 
impacted a "little bump" and became airborne. He reported that he elected to abort the landing 
due to the end of the runway and trees that were "coming up pretty fast". 
The pilot further reported that he knew the airplane would not be able to climb and turn at the 
same time due to the low airspeed. He elected to turn right, and subsequently impacted a fence 
post with the right wing strut. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings, and 
the fuselage. 
According to the pilot there were no pre-impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to continue the unstabilized approach and landing and his delayed decision 
to go around with an insufficient climb rate, which resulted with collision with trees.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
