Analysis   
The non-helicopter-rated pilot reported that while performing a bank, at low level, above a 
frozen river, he lost sight of the horizon and the helicopter impacted the frozen river. The 
helicopter came to rest on its left side, which resulted in substantial damage to the main rotor, 
tailboom, and cockpit structure. The non-helicopter-rated pilot further reported to a 
representative of the Federal Aviation Administration and Sheriff's Deputies that the helicopter 
was functioning "normally" at the time of impact and that "somehow I must have lost sight of 
the horizon in all the snow and ice." No preimpact malfunctions or abnormalities were noted 
with the helicopter that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The non-helicopter-rated pilot's improper decision to operate the helicopter at low-level and 
his inability to adequately see the horizon over snow and ice, which resulted in controlled flight 
into terrain.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=90710
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
