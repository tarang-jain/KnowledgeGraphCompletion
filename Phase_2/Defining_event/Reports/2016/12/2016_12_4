Analysis   
The solo student pilot reported that, while on a cross-country flight, the weather deteriorated 
at the destination airport. He decided to complete a touch-and-go landing at an airport along 
the route and then return to the departure airport. The student pilot further reported that, 
when he began the flight back to his original point of departure, the airplane had about 3/4 
tank of fuel remaining, and a headwind was present. About 10 to 15 nautical miles from the 
original departure airport, the fuel supply was exhausted, and the student pilot made a forced 
landing in a field. During the forced landing, the right wing struck a tree and was substantially 
damaged.
The student pilot did not report any preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=94461
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
