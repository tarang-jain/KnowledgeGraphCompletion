Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The student pilot reported that during his first supervised solo landing that was conducted in 
light and variable crosswind conditions, he initiated a go around because, the wind had pushed 
him off course, and he was no longer in a good position to land. He further reported that 
during his second approach "everything looked good", but that immediately after the wheels 
touched down, the airplane veered to the left. He tried to compensate but "very quickly lost 
control". Subsequently, the airplane exited the runway to the left, the nose gear collapsed, and 
the right wing struck the ground.
A post-accident examination revealed substantial damage to the right wing rear spar.
The student pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions 
with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
A review of local weather at the time of the accident showed the wind 070 degrees true at 6 
nautical miles per hour, and not gusting. The student pilot landed on runway 28.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's inadequate compensation for the quartering tailwind on landing, which 
resulted in a loss of directional control.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
