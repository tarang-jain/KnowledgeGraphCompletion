Accident Number:
GAA16CA142
Date & Time:
03/01/2016, 1145 AKS 
Registration:
N12BE
Aircraft:
MAULE M5
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The student pilot and his flight instructor conducted 6 takeoffs and landings in the tailwheel-
equipped airplane. The student pilot then took off solo, flew in the traffic pattern, and during 
the landing he reported that as soon as my wheels hit the pavement it jerked hard to the right. 
The student pilot attempted to "straighten it out" but he reported that the airplane was going 
too fast so he applied power and attempted to take off. He then stated that the airplane 
"jumped me to the right of the runway," the airplane departed the runway to the right, the 
propeller impacted terrain, and the main landing gear collapsed under the fuselage. The 
airplane sustained substantial damage to the two right wing lift struts. 
The student pilot verified that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions 
with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
As a safety recommendation, the student pilot stated "more practice" and "land on gravel."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing, which resulted in 
a runway excursion, and an impact with terrain.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
