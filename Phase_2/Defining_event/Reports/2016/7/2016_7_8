Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Bullard, TX
Accident Number:
CEN16LA244
Date & Time:
07/02/2016, 1945 CDT 
Registration:
N250AB
Aircraft:
POLLACK QUICKSILVER SPRINT2S
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Flight control sys malf/fail
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airline transport pilot stated that a preflight check of the flight controls revealed no 
anomalies, and he and the passenger taxied the float-equipped airplane from its dock onto the 
lake for takeoff. The pilot reported that, shortly after takeoff, the flight controls felt abnormal, 
and he elected to return to the lake for landing. He stated that he could not correct the 
airplane's bank angle before touching down, and the airplane landed hard on the water in a 
right bank. The pilot and passenger egressed, and the airplane subsequently sank. Attempts to 
locate and retrieve the airplane following the accident were unsuccessful; therefore, no 
examination of the airplane was performed, and the reason for the pilot's reported control 
difficulties could not be determined. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of airplane control during landing for reasons that could not be determined, because the 
airplane sank and was not recovered.

Factual Information
On July 2, 2016, about 1945 central daylight time, a Pollack Quicksilver Sprint2S airplane, 
N250AB, impacted Lake Palestine, Texas, during a forced landing. The airline transport rated 
pilot and his passenger were uninjured. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The 
airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 
personal flight. Day visual meteorological conditions existed in the area of the accident site 
about the time of the accident, and the flight was not operated on a flight plan. The local flight 
was originating at the time of the accident.
According to the pilot's accident report, he performed a preflight check of the airplane while it 
was tied to a dock. He taxied out about 1930 and the flight control check was "all good." The 
pilot started a takeoff to the south and after takeoff, the controls did not feel right. He arrested 
the climb out and turned north. The controls still did not "seem right" so the pilot turned right 
to return for a landing. He could not arrest all of the right turn and landed hard with a right 
bank. The airplane impacted the water with its right float first and the float took on water. The 
airplane remained afloat as the pilot began towing it to shore. The towing process was delayed 
as wardens and troopers requested reports and it was during this time that the airplane sank. 
The pilot hired a salvage company. However, the airplane was not located and therefore could 
not be examined as part of this investigation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
