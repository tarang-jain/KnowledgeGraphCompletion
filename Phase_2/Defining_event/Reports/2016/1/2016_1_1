Analysis   
The pilot reported that he was practicing touch-and-go landings in the airport traffic pattern. 
He made one trip in the airport traffic pattern and touched down on the runway. After 
touching down, he applied full power to take off and the airplane veered and banked to the left. 
The pilot further reported that the left wing impacted the ground when the airplane was about 
20 to 30 feet above the ground. The airplane rotated around the wing and impacted the ground 
off the left side of the runway.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, 
firewall, and both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
