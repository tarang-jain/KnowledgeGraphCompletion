Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
According to the pilot, his intent was to perform a touch and go landing on a runway with 
patches of snow extending from the approach end to the departure end. The pilot reported that 
the touchdown and landing roll were uneventful. He reported that as he aborted the landing 
and configured the airplane for takeoff, he retracted the flaps, advanced the throttle and 
applied right rudder. He recalled that when he advanced the throttle, the airplane immediately 
made a sharp left turn, exited the runway to the left, and impacted the residual snow that was 
previously cleared from the runway. The airplane nosed over and the pilot exited the runway 
under his own power. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the vertical stabilizer and 
both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical failures or anomalies prior to or during the 
flight that would have prevented normal flight operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain airplane control during the takeoff, resulting in a runway 
excursion, and airplane nose over.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
