Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
According to the pilot of the tricycle landing gear equipped airplane, he was performing a 
normal approach and landing to an asphalt runway. He reported that after accomplishing the 
landing flare he recalled "jockeying" the stick in order to get closer to the runway. The airplane 
touched down, bounced three times and the pilot added power. The airplane struck the ground 
a fourth time and the nose gear collapsed. The pilot reported that the airplane skidded down 
the center of the runway and came to a halt. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the 
firewall and frame.  
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical failures or anomalies prior to or during the 
flight that would have prevented normal flight operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain pitch control during the landing, causing the airplane to bounce 
and the nose gear to collapse, resulting in substantial damage to the firewall and frame.
Findings
Aircraft
Pitch control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Nose/tail landing gear - Damaged/degraded
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
