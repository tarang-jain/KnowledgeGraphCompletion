Registration:
N6703L
Aircraft:
BEECH 76
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The flight instructor in the multi-engine airplane reported that during a biennial flight review 
the pilot released the brakes and added full power for takeoff. The flight instructor further 
reported that during the takeoff roll he utilized the left engine mixture control to simulate a left 
engine failure, but the pilot "froze" at the flight controls and the airplane veered to the left. The 
flight instructor attempted to fail the right engine via the right mixture control in order to 
regain directional control, but his hand came off the mixture control and the airplane exited 
the runway. During the runway excursion, the flight instructor "finally got [his] hand back on 
the right mixture and pulled it to idle cut-off"; subsequently, the nose landing gear collapsed.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or 
malfunctions with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during a simulated left engine failure during 
takeoff. Also causal to the accident was the flight instructor's delayed remedial action to 
maintain directional control and reduce the right engine mixture control.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=94342
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
