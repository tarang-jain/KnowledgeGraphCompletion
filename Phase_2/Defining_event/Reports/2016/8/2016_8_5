ANC16CA050
Date & Time:
08/02/2016, 2105 AKD 
Registration:
N8512Q
Aircraft:
HOLLEY CAROL L ANTARES
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that while practicing stop-and-go landings with a crosswind condition, the 
tricycle-geared weight-shift control (WSC) airplane "weathervaned" to the right upon 
touchdown. In an attempt to correct for the weathervane, the pilot applied right pedal, the 
airplane departed the runway to the right, and tipped over coming to rest on the right leading 
edge of the wing. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wing keel.
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aviation safety inspector who responded to the 
accident site reported that he observed no mechanical malfunctions or failures with airframe 
and engine that would have precluded normal operation and none was reported to him by the 
pilot.
In the recommendation section of the National Transportation Safety Board Accident/Incident 
Reporting Form 6120.1, the pilot stated that the accident may have been avoided if he had 
additional training that concentrated on ground handling and crosswind condition operations. 
The FAA has published the Weight-Shift Control Aircraft Flying Handbook FAA-H-8083-5 
(2008). This handbook discusses crosswind landing procedures for WSC airplanes and states 
in part:
When in final approach, the wind correction angle (crab angle) is established by heading 
toward the wind with the wings level so that the aircraft's ground track remains aligned with 
the centerline of the runway. This crab angle is maintained all the way to touchdown, when the 
rear wheels hit first and rotate the carriage and wing around so the front wheel touches the 
ground with the carriage going straight. However, if in turbulent air or pitched forward during 
the touchdown, with the front wheel touching the ground first, the pilot should lightly control 
the steering of the front wheel to be headed in the direction the carriage is going. WSC carriage 
front landing gear typically has camber that tends to steer the front wheel naturally in the 
direction of travel, so a light touch on the front wheel as it touches the ground allows it to find 
its own direction of travel. Once the front wheel is on the ground, lower the nose to keep the 
WSC on the ground and steer as required down the center of the runway.

The procedure for the wing during the roundout is the same as that for normal and turbulent 
roundout and touchdowns. The exception is that after touchdown the windward wing should 
be lowered slightly so the wind cannot get under it to flip the WSC aircraft during later landing 
roll and taxi.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the weight-shift control airplane during the 
landing in a crosswind condition, which resulted in a runway excursion, a tip over of the wing, 
and a collision with terrain.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
