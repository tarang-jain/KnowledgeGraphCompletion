Aircraft:
CESSNA 150
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that during landing the airplane's nose wheel impacted the runway first and 
the axle broke. The pilot further reported that the airplane continued to slide on the runway 
bending the nose wheel strut, which resulted in substantial damage to the airplane's firewall.
The pilot reported that there were no pre impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain an appropriate pitch attitude during landing, which resulted in 
an initial nose wheel contact, followed by a nose gear collapse, and the airplane came to rest in 
a nose down position.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
