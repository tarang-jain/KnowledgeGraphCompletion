Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
According to the pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane, after performing a local flight, he 
made a normal approach to a dirt and grass covered airstrip. He reported that he executed a 
wheel landing and the airplane veered left of the airstrip heading as the left main landing gear 
began to sink into the mud. The airplane struck a barbed wire fence and came to rest nose 
down in a water filled ditch. The pilot reported that he shut off the aircraft systems and he and 
his passenger exited the airplane; however, he reported that he did see fuel leaking from the 
fuel tanks as a result of the angle at which the airplane came to rest. The pilot recounted that as 
he and his passenger were walking away from the airplane they heard the fuel ignite and the 
airplane became engulfed with flames. The airplane sustained substantial fire damage to the 
wings and fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical failures or anomalies with the airplane prior 
to or during the flight that would have prevented normal flight operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's selection of an unsuitable landing area, resulting in a loss of directional control 
during landing, an airstrip excursion, impact with a fence and the subsequent airplane fire.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=92954
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
