Location:
Yukon, OK
Accident Number:
GAA16CA176
Date & Time:
04/02/2016, 1500 CDT 
Registration:
N107FG
Aircraft:
NORTH AMERICAN AT6
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that as the tail came down during the 
landing roll in gusty wind conditions, a wind gust lifted the airplane about 10 feet into the air, 
with the left wing high. The pilot further reported that the airplane drifted off the runway to the 
right and impacted the ground right wing first.  
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, both wings, and the empennage.
According to the pilot there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. 
A review of recorded data from the automated weather observation station located about 5 
miles to the southeast, revealed that, about 7 minutes before the accident occurred, conditions 
were wind 300 degrees true at 13 knots, wind gust 18 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll in gusty wind 
conditions, which resulted in runway excursion and impact with terrain.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Gusts - Ability to respond/compensate

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
