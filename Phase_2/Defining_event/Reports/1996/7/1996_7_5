FRANKLIN, LA
Accident Number:
FTW96LA285
Date & Time:
07/01/1996, 0930 CDT 
Registration:
N14637
Aircraft:
Hiller UH12
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Business
Analysis 
The pilot reported that he heard a 'bang' and the engine started 'running rough' while the 
helicopter was operating at about 100 feet AGL.  The pilot elected to execute a precautionary 
landing to 'investigate the source of the engine problems.' The pilot stated that during the 
precautionary landing the 'rotor RPM started to bleed and sufficient RPM could not be 
maintained for a successful landing.' During the low rotor RPM landing touchdown to a muddy 
grass area, the front cross tube collapsed and the aft skid settled into the mud. Examination of 
the airframe revealed that the tailboom, tailrotor gearbox, and a portion of the vertical 
stabilizer were severed from the helicopter as result of impact with the main rotor blades. The 
reason for the partial loss of engine power could not be determined. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
loss of engine power for undetermined reasons, and the pilot's failure to maintain rotor RPM.  
A factor was the unsuitable terrain available for the precautionary landing.

Factual Information
 On July 1, 1996, at 0930 central daylight time, a Hiller UH12E helicopter, N14637, was 
substantially damaged while executing a precautionary landing following a partial loss of 
engine power near Franklin, Louisiana.  The helicopter, owned and operated by a private 
owner, was being operated under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and a flight plan was not filed.  The commercial pilot, sole occupant of the aircraft, 
was not injured.  The local business flight originated from Patterson, Louisiana, at 0815.
During personal interviews, conducted by the FAA inspector, the pilot reported that he heard a 
"bang" and the helicopter engine started "running rough" while the helicopter was operating at 
about 100 feet AGL en route between Patterson and Franklin.  The pilot further stated that he 
elected to execute a precautionary landing to "investigate the source of the engine problems."  
The pilot further stated that during the precautionary landing the "rotor RPM started to bleed 
and sufficient RPM could not be maintained for a successful landing."  During the low rotor 
RPM landing touchdown to a muddy grass area, the front cross tube collapsed and the aft skid 
settled into the mud.  
Examination of the airframe revealed that the tailboom, tailrotor gearbox, and a portion of the 
vertical stabilizer were severed from the helicopter as result of impact with the main rotor 
blades.  The reason for the partial loss of engine power could not be determined.
The pilot did not complete any of the several Pilot/Operator Reports (NTSB Form 6120.1/2) 
that were mailed to him.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
