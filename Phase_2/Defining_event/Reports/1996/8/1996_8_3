Factual Information
 On August 1, 1996, about 1308 central daylight time, a Cessna 172N, N737DK, registered 
to Dayton Aviation Inc., leased by Air Venture Flying Club, operating as a 14 CFR Part 91 
personal flight,  experienced a loss of engine power in cruise flight in the vicinity of Victoria, 
Mississippi, and crashed.   Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a visual rules flight 
plan was filed. The airplane sustained substantial damage, and the pilot reported minor 
injuries. The flight originated from Columbia, Mississippi, 2 hours 26 minutes before the 
accident.
The pilot stated he initially departed New Orleans, Louisiana, en route for Olive Branch, 
Mississippi, and diverted into Columbia, Mississippi due to weather. He obtained a weather 
briefing and departed for his destination airport. He was in cruise flight at 4,000 feet, in 
contact with Memphis  tower, when the engine quit. He informed Memphis  tower that he had 
run out of gas. He made a forced landing to an open field. The airplane collided with trees on 
the final approach, nosed over, and came to rest inverted.
Examination of the airframe, flight controls, and engine assembly revealed no evidence 
of a precrash mechanical failure or malfunction. The left and right fuel tanks were not 
ruptured. About  1 1/2 gallons of fuel was drained from the right fuel tank, and about 3 quarts 
of fuel was drained from the left fuel tank.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
