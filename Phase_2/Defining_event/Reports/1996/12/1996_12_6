Registration:
N6532S
Aircraft:
Cessna 150H
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:

2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane's engine lost complete power, and the pilot requested radar vectors to the nearest 
airport. While on short final, the airplane struck trees, turned 180 opposite the direction of 
travel, and impacted the ground. The pilot stated that just after establishing radar contact with 
ATC, the airplane 'experienced [a] power failure.'  The engine then surged momentarily for 
about 30 seconds, then stopped. The pilot did not try to restart the engine again. He performed 
a forced landing, but was not able to reach the airport due to head winds. The airplane had 
begun a descent from 6,000 feet, shortly before the engine failed. The carburetor heat control 
was found in the 'cold' position, and the fuel selector was 'on.'  Fuel was found in both fuel 
tanks. The airplane's engine was examined, started, and ran without any discrepancies noted. 
About 31 miles west-southwest at Valdosta, Ga, the temperature and dew point at 1955 EST 
were 46 and 41 degrees, respectively. According to icing probability charts, conditions at 
Valdosta were conducive for carburetor ice. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
carburetor ice, due to the pilot's improper use of carburetor heat, which resulted in a forced 
landing and impact with trees.

Factual Information
 On December 2, 1996, about 2025 eastern standard time, a Cessna 150H, N6532S, 
registered to a private owner, operating as a Title 14 CFR Part 91, personal flight, crashed 
during a forced landing near Homerville, Georgia.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed 
and a VFR flight plan was filed.  The airplane was substantially damage.  The airline transport 
pilot, and one passenger were not injured.
The airplane's engine lost complete power, and the pilot requested radar vectors to the 
nearest airport.  The pilot was vectored to Homerville, and while on short final, the airplane 
struck trees, turned 180 opposite the direction of travel, and impacted the ground.
The pilot stated that just after establishing radar contact with ATC, the airplane 
"experienced [a] power failure."  The engine then surged momentarily, for about 30 seconds 
then stopped.  The pilot did not try to restart the engine again, and performed a forced landing, 
but was not able to reach the airport because of the head winds.
According to the FAA inspector's statement, the airplane had begun a descent from 
6,000 feet, shortly before the engine failed.  The carburetor heat control was found in the 
"cold" position, and the fuel selector was "on."  Both fuel tanks, and the gascolator sump drain, 
"contained fuel."  The airplane's engine was examined, started and ran without any 
discrepancies noted.  The FAA inspector wrote in his statement that based on the engine run 
the cause of the loss of engine power "could not be determined."  He further stated "the 
possibility of carburetor icing does exist."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
