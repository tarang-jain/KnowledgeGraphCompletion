Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported he was attempting to take off from an off-airport site on a remote island.  
The takeoff area was surrounded by trees and brush, and the pilot said there was a right, 
quartering headwind from the northwest which he estimated as 10 to 15 knots, with higher 
gusts.  Shortly after lift-off, the pilot said he lost control of the airplane and collided with 
adjoining brush.  He said he was unaware if the wind suddenly quit, or if he was blown into the 
brush by a wind gust. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the gusty crosswind conditions.  Factors associated 
with the accident were the crosswind and wind gusts.

Factual Information
 On October 2, 1996, about 1830 Alaska daylight time,  a wheel equipped Piper PA-22 airplane, 
N2821P, sustained substantial damage when it collided with terrain during takeoff from an off 
airport site near Hanning Bay, Montague Island, which is located approximately 22 miles 
southeast of Port Ashton, Alaska.  The commercial certificated pilot and the one passenger 
aboard were not injured.  The 14 CFR Part 91 flight operated in visual meteorological 
conditions without a flight plan.
During a telephone conversation with the NTSB investigator-in-charge on October 6, 1996, the 
pilot related that he and a hunting companion were attempting to takeoff to the west from an 
off airport site to return to Anchorage.  The pilot described the takeoff area as a "bush 
strip...rocky gravel with tundra over...narrow with alders and spruce on both sides and at end."  
The takeoff area was approximately 1400 feet long and 25 feet wide.  He said that shortly after 
liftoff, he lost control of the airplane and crashed.  The pilot said the prevailing wind was a 
right-quartering headwind, which he estimated as 10 to 15 knots, with higher gusts.  He 
reported that he is unsure if the wind suddenly quit, or if he encountered a wind gust, but said 
he apparently got away from the  runway's center, and collided with adjoining brush.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
