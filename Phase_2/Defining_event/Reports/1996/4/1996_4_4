Factual Information
 On April 1, 1996, at 1355 central standard time, a Cessna 210K, N9470M, operated by a private 
pilot, sustained substantial damage when the right main gear collapsed on landing.  The 
airplane landed on runway 10 (4,751' x 75' dry/asphalt) at DuPage Airport, West Chicago, 
Illinois.  The pilot reported no injuries.  The local personal 14 CFR Part 91 flight was operating 
in visual meteorological conditions.  No flight plan was on file.  The flight departed West 
Chicago, Illinois, about 1200.
Subsequent to the accident an examination of the landing gear retraction/extension 
mechanism was conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  According to the 
FAA inspector there were airworthiness directives (AD) pertaining the landing gear which had 
not been accomplished.  The same inspector stated the AD's directly affected the function of 
the retraction/extension mechanism system.
The pilot told FAA inspectors that he did not have a current biennial flight review.  His FAA 
third class medical was issued on August 15, 1995; however, it was valid for three months and 
had expired at the time of the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
