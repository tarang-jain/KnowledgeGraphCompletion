Factual Information
 On February 4, 1996, approximately 1000 Pacific standard time, a Cessna 172M, N6750H, 
being flown by a private pilot, sustained substantial damage when it collided with a tree top 
while in cruise on the lee side of Capitol Peak, approximately 6 nautical miles west of the 
Olympia airport, Olympia, Washington. The pilot reported visual meteorological conditions at 
the time of the accident. No flight plan had been filed. The pilot and three passengers were 
uninjured. The flight, which was a personal sightseeing trip, was to have been operated under 
14CFR91, and originated from Tacoma, Washington, approximately 0900.
In a telephone interview, the pilot reported that he crossed Capitol Peak (elevation 
approximately 2,660 feet above sea level) approximately 400-500 feet above the terrain, 
headed eastbound, at approximately 65 percent power and immediately thereafter encountered 
a downdraft. The aircraft descended to tree top level and impacted a tree. Subsequent to the 
collision the pilot determined that the aircraft had sustained leading edge damage to its right 
wing from a point just forward of the strut attach point outboard for approximately 2 feet. He 
then diverted into Olympia landing approximately 1015.
The pilot reported westerly winds of 15 knots gusting to 20 knots at the time of the accident. 
The forecast winds at Seattle at 3,000 feet above sea level were for the morning of the accident 
were from 300 degrees true at 17 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
