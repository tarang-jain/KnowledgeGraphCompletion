Analysis 
According to the operator, the pilot requested to rent a helicopter.  He showed the operator his 
pilot certificate and flight log book; however, the operator did not record this information nor 
obtain a current address and telephone number.  The pilot was not given a check out in the 
helicopter prior to the accident flight.  The operator observed the pilot hover the helicopter, 
takeoff and depart the traffic pattern.  The operator subsequently received a telephone call 
from the pilot stating he had landed the helicopter 'hard' at the North Dallas Jetport, which 
was under construction, and requested to be pick up.  When the operator arrived at the North 
Dallas Jetport, he found the helicopter on its side, and the pilot could not be located.  Injury is 
presumed.  There were no reported eye witnesses to this accident.  The FAA has no record of 
the named pilot having either an airman or a medical certificate.  .

Factual Information
 On September 1, 1996, about 1730 central daylight time, a Hughes 269B helicopter, N9558F, 
registered to C and J Communications Inc., and operated by Addison Helicopters as a Title 14 
CFR Part 91 personal flight, was substantially damaged during a hard landing near Frisco, 
Texas.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a flight plan was not filed.  The pilot 
was reported as not injured.  The local flight originated from Addison Airport, Dallas, Texas, 
about 30 minutes before the accident.
According to the operator, the pilot requested to rent a helicopter.  He showed the operator his 
pilot certificate and flight log book; however, the operator did not record this information nor 
obtain a current address and telephone number.  The pilot was not given a check out in the 
helicopter prior to the accident flight; however, the operator observed the pilot hover the 
helicopter, takeoff and depart the traffic pattern.  The operator received a telephone call from 
the pilot stating he had landed the helicopter "hard" at the North Dallas Jetport, which was 
under construction, and requested to be pick up.  When the operator arrived at the North 
Dallas Jetport, he found the helicopter on its side, and the pilot could not be located.  There 
were no reported eye witnesses to this accident.
Examination of the helicopter by a FAA inspector on September 5, 1996, at the Wills Point 
Airport revealed that all main rotor blades were damaged, the skid tubes and their fuselage 
attaching mounts were fractured, the tail rotor drive shaft was twisted nearly 180 degrees, and 
the tail rotor was damaged.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
