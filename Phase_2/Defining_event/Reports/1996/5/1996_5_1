Analysis 
The pilot of the Zenith, N200BV, had been cleared to conduct touch-and-go landings to hard 
surface runway 19L. Two minutes later, the pilot of a Cessna 185, N1074F, was cleared to land 
on gravel runway 19 that is oriented on the same magnetic heading as the hard surface runway 
but is displaced about 650 feet south of the end of the hard surface runway.  There is no lateral 
displacement between the two runways. One minute later, the controller cleared the pilot of the 
Zenith to land, and advised '...I'll call the departure.' The controller did not receive a verbal 
response, only a garbled radio transmission. The pilot of the Zenith performed a touch-and-go 
and emerged under the second airplane that was in the landing approach to the gravel runway. 
The FAA's handbook for air traffic conrollers does not contain procedures for simultaneous 
operations on runways that are oriented on the same heading and not laterally parallel to each 
other. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
the pilot's improper understanding of his amended clearance, and the local controller's failure 
to assure that the pilot understood that he was cleared only to land. Factors in the incident 
were: the airport design that places two airplanes in close proximity to each other, and the 
FAA's insufficient standards for simultaneous operations to runways not laterally displaced 
from one another.

Factual Information
 On May 1, 1996, at 1757 Alaska daylight time, an experimental Super Acro Zenith, N200BV, 
had a near-midair collision with a Cessna 185, N1074F, at Fairbanks International Airport, 
Fairbanks, Alaska.  Both airplanes were being operated under visual flight rules (VFR) for 
landing on runway 19.  The pilot/owner of N200BV was not injured and the airplane was not 
damaged.  N1074F, operated by Arctic Air Alaska Inc., Salcha, Alaska, was not damaged and 
the pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The Fairbanks International Airport has four landing areas.  Runway 19R/01L is a hard surface 
runway that is 10,300 feet long and 150 feet wide.  Runway 19L/01R is a hard surface runway 
that is 3,190 feet long and 60 feet wide.  A seaplane landing area (water lane 19/01) separates 
runway 19R from 19L.  The ski strip 19/01 is a gravel surface runway that is 3,978 feet long and 
75 feet wide and is oriented on the same magnetic heading as runway 19L/01R.  There is no 
lateral displacement between the two runways.  The arrival end of the ski strip 19 is displaced 
directly south of the departure end of runway 19L about 650 feet and is intersected by taxiway 
B.  The control tower is located along the east edge of the airport surface area, just south of 
taxiway B.
Review of the air-ground radio communications tapes maintained by the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA), Fairbanks, Alaska, Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) facility, revealed 
that N200BV's radio was difficult to understand.  The air traffic control specialist working the 
position of local control initially responded to N200BV's call sign as N700BV and later utilized 
the proper call sign.  This confusion persisted throughout the incident.  At 1750:41, the pilot of 
N200BV reported that he was seven miles east of the Fairbanks airport and requested touch 
and go landings.  The local controller advised the pilot to report abeam Metro Field.  At 
1754:24, N200BV was advised..."OK sir, follow a Piper Cherokee on a ah looks like a two mile 
final for 19L, follow that Cherokee, you're number two, cleared for touch and go."
At 1752:49, the pilot of N1074F contacted the Fairbanks tower and was given instructions to 
continue his downwind approach, with the controller providing instructions to begin a base 
turn.  At 1755:46, the local controller advised N1074F..."and I'm going to try and get you in a 
short approach just inside the tower."  At 1756:14, the controller advised..."Cessna 1074F, base 
now, ski strip ah 19, cleared to land."  At 1756:29,  the controller advised..."N700BV, runway 
19L, cleared to land, I'll call the departure."  There was no response and at 1756:31, the 
controller repeated the previous clearance.  At 1756:33, a garbled radio transmission was 
received.  The pilot of N200BV performed a touch and go and then climbed toward N1074F 
that was landing on the ski strip.
At 1757:22, the pilot of N1074F reported..."74F, I've got traffic right under me."  The local 
controller advised N1074F..."74F roger, I was going to have him land and call his departure but 
he ah slipped on through, ski strip 19, cleared to land."  The pilot of N1074F reported a near-
mid air collision when N200BV emerged under his airplane.  The vertical separation was 
described as 50 feet between the two airplanes. 
A transcript of the air to ground communications between the two airplanes and the Fairbanks 
ATCT is included in this report.
The Fairbanks International Airport, Air Traffic Control Tower Facility Handbook, publication 
7210.1B, contains standard operating procedures that are unique to the airport.  The local 
Page 4 of 7ANC96IA065
controller's position procedures contained in part H, states, in part:  "...1.  Local Control (LC) 
shall:  ...e.  Be responsible for separation of all aircraft that are being controlled by LC."  Part h., 
states:  "The ski/gravel strip and 01R/19L shall be treated as separate runways for same 
direction operations only.  All other aircraft operations shall be considered as the same 
runway."
The FAA's air traffic controller's handbook, publication 7110.65, Chapter 2, Section 4, Radio 
and Interphone Communications, states, in part:  "...2-72 Pilot Acknowledgment/Readback, a.  
When issuing clearances, instructions, or information, ensure acknowledgment by the pilot."
The FAA's air traffic controller's handbook, Chapter 3, Section 1, General, states, in part:  "...3-1 
Provide Service.  Provide airport traffic control service based only upon observed or known 
traffic and airport conditions.  3-1 Note.  When operating in accordance with the FAR's, it is the 
responsibility of the pilot to avoid collision with other aircraft.  However, due to the limited 
space around terminal locations, traffic information can aid pilots in avoiding collision 
between aircraft operating within Class B, C, or D surface areas...."
The FAA's air traffic controller's handbook, Chapter 3, Section 8, Spacing and Sequencing, 
specifies procedures and phraseology that controllers should utilize to establish the sequence 
of arriving and departing aircraft and states, in part:  "...3-90 Sequence/Spacing Application.  
Establish the sequence of arriving and departing aircraft by requiring them to adjust flight or 
ground operations as necessary to achieve proper spacing.  Phraseology:..."Cleared:  touch and 
go, or stop and go, or low approach, or cleared for the option."
Chapter 3, Section 8, 3-92, Simultaneous Same Direction Operation, describes operations to 
laterally parallel runways and states, in part:  "Authorize simultaneous, same direction 
operations on parallel runways, on parallel landing strips, or on a runway and a parallel 
landing strip only when the following conditions are met:  a.  Operations are conducted in VFR 
conditions unless visual separation is applied.  b.  Two-way radio communication is 
maintained with the aircraft involved and pertinent traffic information is issued.  c.  The 
distance between the runways or landing strips is in accordance with the minima in Table 3-
92[1]...."  The table describes minimum centerline and runway edges distances between 
laterally parallel runway.
The air traffic controller's handbook does not contain procedures to be utilized when two 
runways, (in this case the ski strip 19 and runway 19L), are oriented on the same magnetic 
heading and not laterally parallel to each other.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
