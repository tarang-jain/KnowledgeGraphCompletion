Location:
Gonzales, LA
Accident Number:
CEN11CA221
Date & Time:
02/05/2011, 1751 CST 
Registration:
N11790
Aircraft:
CESSNA 150L
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The certified flight instructor did not visually inspect the fuel tanks prior to departure, but 
noted that the fuel gauge was just below the full mark, and the student pilot told him the fuel 
tanks were full. Based on his experience in the airplane, the instructor estimated a total of 4 
hours of fuel on board and then departed on an instructional flight that included numerous 
practice take offs and landings. Approximately 3 hours into the flight, as they were returning to 
their home airport, the engine lost power. The instructor was unable to re-start the engine and 
made a forced landing to a grass field where the right wing impacted a tree, resulting in 
substantial damage to the strut. A Federal Aviation Administration inspector drained both fuel 
tanks and reported that approximately 3/4 of a gallon of fuel was drained from the right wing 
tank and 1/2 of a gallon of fuel was drained from the left wing tank. The fuel line to the 
carburetor was removed and some fuel was found in the line. The gascolator was removed and 
approximately 7 to 8 ounces of fuel (absent of debris) was recovered. The carburetor was 
removed and disassembled and approximately 2 ounces of fuel (absent of debris) was observed 
in the bowl. No mechanical deficiencies were noted with the airplane or engine.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's failure to monitor the available fuel supply, which resulted in a loss of 
engine power due to fuel exhaustion.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=78527
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
