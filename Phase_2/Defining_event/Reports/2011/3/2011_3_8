Analysis   
According to the pilot, she elected to land on an uphill runway with a tailwind and gusts 
present. She recalled that the wind at a nearby airport were indicating a tailwind at 11 knots, 
gusting to 17 knots. She decided not to use flaps and increased her landing speed due to the 
wind conditions. After landing on the grass runway, she was unable to sufficiently decelerate 
the airplane, which resulted in a runway overrun. The airplane collided with trees and 
sustained substantial damage to both wings. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures with the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
