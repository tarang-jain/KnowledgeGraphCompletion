Analysis 
A Cessna 208B and a Cessna 207 collided in flight in daylight visual meteorological conditions. 
The Cessna 208B and the Cessna 207 were both traveling in an easterly direction. According to 
the Cessna 207 pilot, the airplanes departed from two neighboring remote Alaskan villages 
about the same time, and both airplanes were flying along similar flight routes. While en route, 
the Cessna 207 pilot talked with the Cessna 208B pilot on a prearranged, discreet radio 
frequency, and the two agreed to meet up in flight for the return to their home airport. The 
Cessna 207 pilot said that the pilot of the Cessna 208B flew his airplane along the left side of 
her airplane while she was in level cruise flight at 1,200 feet mean sea level and that they 
continued to talk via the radio. Then, unexpectedly and unannounced, the pilot of the Cessna 
208B maneuvered his airplane above and over the top of her airplane. She said that she 
immediately told the Cessna 208B pilot that she could not see him and that she was concerned 
about where he was. She said that the Cessna 208B pilot then said, in part: "Whatever you do, 
don't pitch up." The next thing she recalled was seeing the wings and cockpit of the descending 
Cessna 208B pass by the right side of her airplane, which was instantly followed by an impact 
with her airplane's right wing. She said that after the collision, the Cessna 208B passed 
underneath her airplane from right-to-left before beginning a gradual descent that steepened 
as the airplane continued to the left. It then entered a steep, vertical, nose-down descent before 
colliding with the tundra-covered terrain below followed by a postcrash fire. Unable to 
maintain level cruise flight, the Cessna 207 pilot selected an area of rolling, tundra-covered 
terrain as a forced landing site. 
An examination of both airplanes revealed impact signatures consistent with the Cessna 
208B's vertical stabilizer impacting the Cessna 207's right wing. A portion of crushed and 
distorted wreckage, identified as part of the Cessna 208B's vertical stabilizer assembly, was 
found embedded in the Cessna 207's right wing. The Cessna 208B's severed vertical stabilizer 
and rudder were found about 1,000 feet west of the Cessna 208B's crash site.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT 
On September 2, 2011, about 1335 Alaska daylight time, a Cessna 208B airplane, N207DR, and 
a Cessna 207 airplane, N73789, collided in midair about 9 miles north of Nightmute, Alaska. 
Both airplanes were being operated as charter flights under the provisions of 14 Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 in visual meteorological conditions when the accident 
occurred. The Cessna 208B was operated by Grant Aviation Inc., Anchorage, Alaska, and the 
Cessna 207 was operated by Ryan Air, Anchorage, Alaska. Visual flight rules (VFR) company 
flight following procedures were in effect for each flight. The sole occupant of the Cessna 208B, 
an airline transport pilot, sustained fatal injuries. The sole occupant of the Cessna 207, a 
commercial pilot, was uninjured.  The Cessna 208B was destroyed, and the Cessna 207 
sustained substantial damage. After the collision, the Cessna 208B descended uncontrolled 
and impacted tundra-covered terrain, and a postcrash fire consumed most of the wreckage. 
The Cessna 207's right wing was damaged during the collision and the subsequent forced 
landing on tundra-covered terrain. Both airplanes were based at the Bethel Airport, Bethel, 
Alaska, and were returning to Bethel at the time of the collision. The Cessna 208B departed 
from the Toksook Bay Airport, Toksook Bay, Alaska, about 1325, and the Cessna 207 departed 
from the Tununak Airport, Tununak, Alaska.  
During separate telephone conversations with the National Transportation Safety Board 
(NTSB) investigator-in-charge on September 2, the chief pilot for Ryan Air, as well as the 
director of operations for Grant Aviation, independently reported that both pilots had a close 
personal relationship.
During an initial interview with the NTSB IIC on September 3, in Bethel, the pilot of the Cessna 
207 reported that both airplanes departed from the neighboring Alaskan villages about the 
same time and that both airplanes were en route to Bethel along similar flight routes. She said 
that, just after takeoff from Tununak, she talked with the pilot of the Cessna 208B on a 
prearranged, discreet radio frequency, and the two agreed to meet up in-flight for the flight 
back to Bethel. She said that, while her airplane was in level cruise flight at 1,200 feet above 
mean sea level (msl), the pilot of the Cessna 208B flew his airplane along the left side of her 
airplane, and they continued to talk via radio. She said that the pilot of the Cessna 208B then 
unexpectedly and unannounced climbed his airplane above and over the top of her airplane. 
She said that she immediately told the pilot of the Cessna 208B that she could not see him and 
that she was concerned about where he was. She said that the Cessna 208B pilot then said, in 
part: "Whatever you do, don't pitch up." The next thing she recalled was moments later seeing 
the wings and cockpit of the descending Cessna 208B pass by the right the side of her airplane, 
which was instantaneously followed by an impact with her airplane's right wing.
The Cessna 207 pilot reported that, after the impact, while she struggled to maintain control of 
her airplane, she saw the Cessna 208B pass underneath her airplane from right-to-left, and it 
began a gradual descent, which steepened as the airplane continued to the left and away from 
her airplane. She said that she told the pilot of the Cessna 208B that she thought she was going 
to crash.She said that the pilot of the Cessna 208B simply stated, "Me too." She said that she 
watched as the Cessna 208B continued to descend, and then it entered a steep, vertical, nose-
down descent before it collided with the tundra-covered terrain below. She said that a 
postcrash fire started instantaneously upon impact.

Unable to maintain level cruise flight and with limited roll control, the Cessna 207 pilot 
selected an area of rolling, tundra-covered terrain as a forced landing site. During touchdown, 
the airplane's nosewheel collapsed, and the airplane nosed down.  The Cessna 207's forced 
landing site was about 2 miles east of the Cessna 208B's accident site.

traffic control facility, nor were they required to be.
Radar coverage was not available in the accident area at the flights' altitudes.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
Cessna 208B: 
The wreckage of the Cessna 208B had extensive ground impact and fire damage. Portions of 
the airplane wreckage were still burning when the NTSB IIC and the Alaska State Trooper 
arrived at the scene.  A majority of the main fuselage, cockpit/cabin area, and engine were 
found embedded in a large crater.
The entire cockpit/cabin area from the instrument panel to just forward of the horizontal 
stabilizer was consumed by fire.
The Pratt & Whitney PT6A-114A turbine engine was found imbedded, vertically, into the 
tundra-covered terrain, leaving only the aft portion of the engine accessory gearbox visible.  
Portions of the incinerated fuselage structure and the wings of the airplane were in a vertical, 
nose-down attitude. The longitudinal axis of the fuselage was oriented on a magnetic heading 
of about 040 degrees. (All heading/bearings noted in this report are oriented toward magnetic 
north.)
Page 7 of 10ANC11FA091B
The entire airplane was separated into several main groups. The wings were separated from the 
fuselage and displayed extensive spanwise, leading-edge-aft crushing and folding. The forward 
spar of each wing was compressed to its respective aft spar. The wings were oriented in a near-
vertical attitude with the leading edge of the wings oriented down, about 2 feet beneath the 
surface of the soft and spongy terrain. Each aileron and flap assembly remained attached to the 
trailing edge of their respective wing. Both wing lift struts were still attached to the wings, but 
both were separated at the lower fuselage attach points as a result of fuselage incineration. 
The empennage separated from the fuselage just forward of the vertical stabilizer attach point. 
The empennage was inverted and located just aft of the incinerated fuselage. The right 
horizontal stabilizer displayed leading-edge-aft crushing and upward buckling on the 
underside of the stabilizer. The left horizontal stabilizer displayed aft crushing about midspan 
and aft compression and folding of the leading edge along the outboard half of the stabilizer. 
The vertical stabilizer and rudder assemblies were severed about 18 inches outboard of the 
fuselage attachment points. The upper portions of the vertical stabilizer and rudder were not 
found at the main wreckage site.  The fracture surfaces that were present on the aluminum 
sheet metal of which the vertical stabilizer and rudder are constructed showed significant 
tearing and ripping signatures that extended from the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer 
aft to the trailing edge of the rudder.  
Wreckage Path 
The farthest portion of wreckage was found about 1,500 feet west of the main wreckage site of 
the Cessna 208B. The area was marked by the discovery of portions of the Cessna 208B's 
fragmented vertical stabilizer, which included portions of the black rubber leading-edge 
deicing boot. The flattened portion of the vertical stabilizer's leading edge had red paint 
transfers matching that of the wing of the Cessna 207.   
A large portion of the Cessna 207's severed right aileron was discovered about 1,400 feet west 
of the Cessna 208B's wreckage site. Attached to the severely distorted and crushed portion of 
aileron were portions of structural wing stringers, as well as a small portion of the Cessna 207's 
aft main wing spar. The aileron had black rubber smears embedded into the trailing edge.          
The Cessna 208B's severed rudder and vertical stabilizer were found separately, but close 
together, about 1,000 feet west of the main wreckage site.  The fracture surfaces on the lower 
portions of both control surfaces matched those portions still attached to the Cessna 208's 
empennage. 
Cessna 207:
The wreckage of the Cessna 207 was about 2 miles east of the Cessna 208B's wreckage site, in 
an area of hilly, soft, tundra-covered terrain.  With the exception of a large portion of the 
airplane's right aileron, all of the airplane's major components were found at the main 
wreckage site.
The airplane's right wing trailing edge sustained extensive structural damage during the 
collision. About 48 inches of the airplane's right aileron was missing, and the outboard portion 
right wing flap was crushed and folded inward toward the fuselage.  An 18-inch section of the 
aft wing spar was fractured and compressed forward about 6 inches beyond the rest of the aft 
wing spar assembly. The severed portion of wing spar was held into place by only small shreds 
of aluminum wing skin. The entire outboard section of the right wing was buckled and 
Page 8 of 10ANC11FA091B
distorted. 
A portion of crushed and distorted wreckage, measuring about 6 inches by 4 inches, was 
discovered imbedded into the trailing edge of the right wing. The portion of wreckage was 
painted white, and it had a part number 2631000-16 stamped on the back. The part number 
was identified as a structural doubler assembly for Cessna 208 airplanes, which is installed on 
the upper portion of the vertical stabilizer assembly.  
 
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
A postmortem examination of the Cessna 208B pilot's remains was done under the authority of 
the Alaska State Medical Examiner, Anchorage, on September 6, 2011. However, the report 
notes that, due to the limited amount of remains presented at the time of the autopsy, the 
medical examiner's cause of death was attributed to extensive thermal charring. The report 
also notes that blunt force injury could not be excluded.    
No toxicological examination was done due to the lack of suitable specimens.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=81691
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
