Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
According to the pilot, during landing the wind lifted the left wing of the tailwheel-equipped 
airplane. As the wing came back down, the airplane began to ground loop and the airplane 
veered toward the right side of the runway. Due to observed terrain obstructions, the pilot 
elected to abort the landing and applied engine power. He attempted to clear a row of trees, but 
the airplane struck the trees and fell to the ground. The pilot reported that there were no 
anomalies with regard to the airplane. The airplane damage included bending of the left wing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing and his failure to maintain 
clearance from trees during the attempted aborted landing.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Climb capability - Attain/maintain not possible (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
