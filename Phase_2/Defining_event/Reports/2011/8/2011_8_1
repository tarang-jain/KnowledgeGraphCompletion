Analysis   
The pilot reported that during an aerial application flight, he was paralleling a highway as he 
was applying chemical to a cornfield. He gained altitude to clear a homestead and then 
descended into the field to continue spraying. He reported that the helicopter impacted an 
unmarked wire that was strung diagonally between the road he was paralleling and the corner 
of the property. The helicopter impacted the field and the main rotor blades separated from the 
airframe, causing the helicopter to cartwheel prior coming to a stop. The helicopter sustained 
substantial damage to the main rotor blades and fuselage. The pilot reported that there was no 
mechanical malfunction or failure of the helicopter prior to the wire strike.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=81329
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
