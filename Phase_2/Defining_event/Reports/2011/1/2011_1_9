Analysis 
The pilot reported that the runway at the destination airport was ice-covered, and that upon 
touchdown the surface was slicker than he had anticipated. He aborted the landing by applying 
full power to take off. The airplane was unable to out-climb the rising terrain at the end of the 
runway, and it collided with terrain, sustaining substantial damage to the fuselage and both 
wings. The pilot indicated that there were no mechanical issues with the airplane that 
precluded its normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's misjudgment of the runway surface condition, resulting in an aborted landing and 
collision with rising terrain during the ensuing takeoff attempt.
Findings
Aircraft
Climb capability - Capability exceeded (Cause)
Personnel issues
Identification/recognition - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Snow/slush/ice covered surface - Contributed to outcome

Factual Information
On January 3, 2011, about 1350 Alaska standard time, a Beechcraft E18S-9700 airplane, 
N9001, sustained substantial damage during the takeoff phase of an aborted landing at the 
New Stuyahok Airport, New Stuyahok, Alaska. The airplane was being operated by Air Supply 
Alaska, Inc., Kenai, Alaska, as a visual flight rules(VFR) cargo flight under Title 14, Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 135, when the accident occurred. The solo airline transport pilot was 
not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and company flight following was in 
effect. 
In a written statement to the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge, 
dated January 6, the pilot reported that upon touching down on the ice-covered runway, he 
realized that the runway was slicker than anticipated. He wrote that he applied power to abort 
the landing, but was unable to out-climb the rising terrain at the end of the runway. The 
airplane collided with terrain, and both wings and the fuselage received substantial damage. 
The pilot indicated that there were no mechanical issues with the airplane that precluded 
normal operation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
