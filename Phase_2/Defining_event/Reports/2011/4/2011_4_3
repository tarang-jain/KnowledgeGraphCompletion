Analysis 
The Safety Board's full report is available at 
http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/reports_aviation.html. The Aircraft Accident Brief 
number is NTSB/AAB-13/02. 
On April 1, 2011, about 1558 mountain standard time (MST), a Boeing 737-3H4, N632SW, 
operating as Southwest Airlines flight 812 experienced a rapid decompression while climbing 
through flight level 340. The flight crew conducted an emergency descent and diverted to 
Yuma International Airport (NYL), Yuma, Arizona. Of the 5 crewmembers and 117 passengers 
on board, one crewmember and one nonrevenue off-duty airline employee passenger sustained 
minor injuries. The airplane sustained substantial damage; postaccident inspection revealed 
that a section of fuselage skin about 60 inches long by 8 inches wide had fractured and flapped 
open on the upper left side above the wing. The flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121 as a regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight 
from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, Phoenix, Arizona, to Sacramento International 
Airport, Sacramento, California.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the improper installation of the fuselage crown skin panel at the S-4L lap joint during the 
manufacturing process, which resulted in multiple site damage fatigue cracking and eventual 
failure of the lower skin panel. Contributing to the injuries was flight attendant A's incorrect 
assessment of his time of useful consciousness, which led to his failure to follow procedures 
requiring immediate donning of an oxygen mask when cabin pressure is lost.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
