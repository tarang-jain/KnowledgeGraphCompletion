Accident Number:
CEN12CA003
Date & Time:

Registration:
N2417T

SADLER TERRY RANS S-7 COURIER

Substantial

Fuel starvation
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that he had finished flying for the day and had turned off the fuel shutoff 
valve and tied the airplane down. He noticed a family with a 10-year-old boy at the airport and 
offered to give the boy a ride around the field. The pilot untied the airplane, put the boy in the 
back seat, started the engine, and taxied to the runway. During takeoff, about 30 feet above 
ground level, the engine stopped and the airplane impacted the ground and obstructions on the 
edge of the airport. The impact collapsed the left main landing gear and deformed the forward 
lower fuselage, causing substantial damage. The pilot reported that he had failed to complete a 
preflight cockpit check and did not turn on the fuel shutoff valve. In addition, the pilot reported 
that shoulder harnesses were installed and available but were not worn.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power during takeoff due to fuel starvation as a result of the pilot™s 
inadequate preflight inspection and failure to ensure that the fuel shutoff valve was turned on 
before departure.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
