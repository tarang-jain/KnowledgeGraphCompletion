CEN12CA051
Date & Time:
11/01/2011, 1730 CDT 
Registration:
N711W
Aircraft:
DOWNER BELLANCA 14-19-2

Loss of engine power (total)

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot was on a cross-country flight at 9,500 feet mean sea level. About 20 miles from his 
destination, he started the descent to the airport. The pilot reported that he looked at his fuel 
gauge and decided to switch fuel tanks when the airplane reached 5,000 feet. As he leveled the 
airplane, the engine lost power before the pilot switched fuel tanks. He turned on the fuel 
pump and attempted to turn the fuel selector knob. However, the knob broke in half, leaving 
just the post. Unable to turn the post and restart the engine, the pilot elected to conduct a 
forced landing in an open area. During the forced landing, the left wing was nearly severed in 
two by impact with a tree, the landing gear collapsed, and the fuselage sustained substantial 
damage. After the accident, the pilot stated that he mistakenly turned the fuel gauge selector 
knob and not the fuel selector knob then got distracted by the knob breaking.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation as a result of the pilot™s improper fuel 
management. Contributing to the accident was the pilot™s diverted attention with the broken 
fuel gauge knob.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=82230
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
