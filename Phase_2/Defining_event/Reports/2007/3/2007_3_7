Aircraft:
Mooney M20D

Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The airplane collided with a berm during a forced landing in an industrial building 
construction site following a loss of engine power.  The pilot stated that during the preflight 
inspection he did not check the fuel quantity.  He stated that a month prior to the accident the 
airplane had been "topped off," and then flown about an hour from the right fuel tank.  The 
pilot also said that during the 160 nautical mile accident flight he did not recall switching fuel 
tanks.  About 3 miles north of the destination airport the engine sputtered and lost power.  He 
switched tanks and activated the electric fuel boost pump, the engine restarted momentarily, 
then sputtered and lost power again.  The pilot switched tanks three or four more times to no 
avail.  Post accident inspection of the airplane by the FAA revealed that the right fuel tank was 
empty and the left tank contained about 6 gallons of 100LL aviation fuel.  The fuel line to the 
carburetor did not contain any fuel.  The fuel selector valve was selected to the right tank 
position.  The electric fuel pump was activated and no fuel pressure indication was observed.  
The fuel selector handle was moved to the left fuel tank position and a fuel pressure indication 
was observed in the normal operating range.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate in-flight fuel system management, which resulted in fuel starvation and 
a loss of engine power.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
