Analysis   
According to the pilot he was conducting touch and go landings. During the landing flare the 
nose of the gyroplane drifted to the right. The pilot reported that he was not able to 
compensate for the winds. The gyroplane impacted the runway with the left landing gear 
followed by the right landing gear. The gyroplane bounced and impacted the runway again, 
coming to rest on its side, resulting in minor damage. The pilot sustained serious injuries. The 
pilot reported winds 90 degrees to the runway at 10 to 15 miles per hour. An examination of the 
gyroplane's structure and systems revealed minor damage and no anomalies. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control during the landing flare resulting in a hard 
landing. Contributing factors were the crosswind and the pilot's failure to recover from a 
bounced landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
