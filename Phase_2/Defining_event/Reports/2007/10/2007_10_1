Analysis   
The private pilot, who was also the builder of the airplane, reported that his approach speed 
was too high as he was attempting to land at his 1,300-foot-long private airstrip, so he elected 
to abort the landing.  During the go-around, he applied full power and pitched the nose of the 
airplane up to establish a climb; however, the installed electronic propeller control sensed an 
over boost condition and reduced the engine power.  As result of the power reduction, there 
was not a sufficient power to maintain altitude and as the pilot was attempting to clear 
obstacles, the airplane's airspeed got too slow.  Subsequently, the airplane stalled and collided 
with trees.  The pilot further stated that he had forgotten to place the electronic propeller 
control switch in the manual mode when he applied full power, which would have prevented 
the loss of power.  The pilot was not injured and was able to egress from the airplane 
unassisted.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadvertent stall during a forced landing.  A contributing factor was the pilot's 
failure to place the electronic prop controller in the manual mode prior to aborting the landing 
which resulted in a loss of  engine power.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
