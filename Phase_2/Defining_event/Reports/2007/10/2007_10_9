Analysis   
The airplane was consumed by fire following a re-start of the engine.  The pilot stated that he 
had taxied to the run up area and shutdown the engine to retrieve items from the baggage 
compartment.  He restarted the engine and shortly thereafter, felt heat and saw flames coming 
from the lower portion of the engine cowling.  Post accident testing by the Federal Aviation 
Administration accident coordinator showed that the fuel line fitting from the gascolator to the 
fuel pump leaked.  The source of ignition for the fire could not be determined.   Based on a 
review of the logbooks, the Federal Aviation Administration accident coordinator stated that 
no recent maintenance had been performed on the fitting.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
