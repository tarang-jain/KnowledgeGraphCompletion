Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot stated he was 15 miles north of the destination airport when he was cleared for a left 
downwind landing.   He said he switched from the right fuel tank to the left fuel tank, and 
noted the right fuel tank was indicating 20 gallons.  When he selected flaps, they would not 
work.  On short final, he attempted to apply power, and noticed the engine was not producing 
power.  He switched to the right fuel tank, with no response from the engine.  He elected to 
land in a field, and made a hard landing in the grass, where the airplane nosed over.  
Postaccident examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector revealed that the left fuel tank 
had ample fuel, but the right fuel tank was empty.  The inspector stated that the accident 
airplane was out of annual inspection, and the pilot's biennial flight review was past due.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper fuel management during the landing approach, resulting in a loss of 
engine power due to fuel starvation, and a forced off-airport landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
