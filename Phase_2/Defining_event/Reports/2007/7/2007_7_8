Analysis   
The balloon caught fire after landing during the Battle Creek Field of Flight Hot Air Balloon 
Festival.  The pilot stated that after approximately one hour in the air, the balloon landed safely 
in a yard.  When the pilot looked up inside the top of the balloon envelope, the "parachute top 
did not reseat."  He attempted to reseat the top by using a "blast of heat" from the burners but 
it did not work.  The pilot "knew the balloon would quickly sink down on top of the basket" so 
he turned the burners to their horizontal position and prepared to push the envelope fabric 
away.  When the balloon envelope began to descend towards the ground the pilot reported that 
"we suddenly had a fire in the basket."  Both the pilot and passenger were able to exit the 
basket.  The pilot "determined the fire was coming from the burners" so he returned to the 
basket and turned off the fuel tanks.  The fire was subsequently extinguished by the passenger 
and bystanders.  An examination of the balloon after the accident revealed the fuel valve for the 
whisper burners was in the "on" position.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The whisper burner's fuel valve opening for undetermined reasons, which resulted in a fire 
after landing.  A factor in the accident was the balloon envelope's parachute top not reseating.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
