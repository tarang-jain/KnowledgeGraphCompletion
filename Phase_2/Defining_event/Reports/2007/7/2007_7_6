Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot stated that the airplane was on the glide path and approach speed was approximately 
85 knots. Several minutes prior, the manifold pressure gauge became erratic and was unable to 
be used as an accurate indication. He pushed the manifold control full forward for the 
remainder of the approach. The landing touchdown was 1/3 down the runway and seemed to 
be a "tad fast".  Halfway down the runway, he realized the engine wasn't going completely to 
idle. At about 2/3 down the runway, knowing that the airplane was too fast, he looked at the 
option of going around and ruled it out because of the slow speed and the height needed to 
clear the tree line. He attempted to slow the airplane by applying full brakes; however, was 
unable to slow down before running off the runway. The pilot stated to the NTSB investigator 
that there were no mechanical issues with the airplane and he should have initiated a go-
around. The published length of runway 18/36 at the Freeway Airport, Mitchellville, Maryland, 
is 2,420 feet by 40 feet. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to attain the proper touchdown point for landing and his failure to initiate a 
go-around when he realized the airplane would touchdown past the intended point.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
