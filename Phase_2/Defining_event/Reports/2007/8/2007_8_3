Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The airplane was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain during an aborted landing 
attempt on runway 14, 3050 feet long, by 75 feet wide, dry asphalt. The pilot stated that as he 
was lowering the tailwheel to the runway, he impacted two geese.  The airplane started to "turn 
to the right" while the pilot tried to correct using left brake, left rudder, and right aileron 
control inputs.  The pilot then added full engine power "to get back in the air."  The left wing 
subsequently contacted the runway and the airplane "flipped on its back" and came to rest 
inverted.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control, which resulted in impact with terrain during 
an attempted aborted landing.  A factor in the accident was the geese impacted during the 
landing roll.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
