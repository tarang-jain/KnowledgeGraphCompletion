Location:
Hampton, IA
Accident Number:
CHI07LA246
Date & Time:

Registration:
N50877
Aircraft:
Air Tractor AT-502B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The airplane was substantially damaged when it struck a ditch along the edge of the runway 
during an aborted landing. The pilot reported that there was a right 45 degree crosswind at 20 
knots which decreased just as he was touching down. The airplane then yawed to the right and 
the pilot applied power to execute an aborted landing. The airplane subsequently became 
airborne and crossed over the ditch along the right side of the runway. The airplane settled to 
the ground and the left wing tip struck the ditch edge.  The airplane subsequently spun to the 
left, the right landing gear collapsed, and the airplane slid across the runway.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing.  Contributing to the accident 
was a ditch.

Factual Information
On August 1, 2007, about 0915 central daylight time, an Air Tractor AT-502B, operated by 
Keller Flying Service, and piloted by a commercial pilot, sustained substantial damage during 
an aborted landing on runway 17 (4,018 feet by 75 feet), at the Hampton Municipal Airport 
(HPT), Hampton, Iowa.  The 14 CFR Part 137 aerial application flight was operating in visual 
meteorological conditions without a flight plan.  No injuries were reported.  The local flight 
originated at an unconfirmed time.
The pilot stated that while landing on runway 17 at HPT the winds were about 20 knots from 
the southwest.  He said that just as he was touching down the wind speed decreased,  which 
resulted in the airplane yawing to the right.  He said that the tires began to skip and he applied 
power to execute a go-around.  He stated that as he crossed the ditch along the right side of the 
runway the airplane settled to the ground and the left wing tip struck the ditch.  The airplane 
subsequently spun to the left, the right landing gear collapsed, and the airplane slid across the 
runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
