Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Fort Lauderdale, FL
Accident Number:
NYC07LA183
Date & Time:
08/01/2007, 2000 EDT 
Registration:
N60801
Aircraft:
Piper Aerostar 601P
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
As the airplane turned onto final approach in the traffic pattern, at an altitude of 1,000 feet, the 
right engine began a violent vibration and started to lose power. The airplane was unable to 
maintain altitude, and the pilot attempted a forced landing to a road. As the airplane reached 
an altitude of approximately 300 feet, it began to lose directional control and impacted a traffic 
light. After touchdown, the airplane began to skid and impacted several objects on the ground 
before coming to rest. Metallurgical examination of the right engine revealed that it lost power 
due to a fatigue-fractured crankshaft. The pilot had positioned the right propeller control to 
feather, but the right propeller did not feather due to the fractured crankshaft. The engine was 
most recently overhauled 11 years prior to the accident, and the engine had accumulated 471 
hours since then.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The total loss of power in one engine during approach, due to a fatigue fracture of the 
crankshaft.

Factual Information
On August 1, 2007, at approximately 2000 eastern daylight time, a Piper Aerostar 601P, 
N60801, was substantially damaged during a forced landing to a road in Fort Lauderdale, 
Florida. The certificated commercial pilot and two passengers were not injured. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the local flight, which 
departed from Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport (FXE), Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The 
personal flight was conducted under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.
According to the pilot, after departing runway 26, he remained in the traffic pattern for a 
landing. As he turned the airplane onto the final approach, at an altitude of 1,000 feet mean 
sea level, the right engine began a violent vibration and started to lose power. The pilot stated 
he advanced the mixture, propeller, and throttle levers to the full forward position, and turned 
the fuel boost pump on. The right engine then completely lost power and the pilot placed the 
propeller lever in the feathered position. He advanced the left engine throttle to full power, 
retracted the landing gear and established the aircraft on final approach. The airplane was 
unable to maintain airspeed and altitude, and the pilot decided to perform a forced landing to a 
road parallel to runway 26. As the airplane reached an altitude of approximately 300 feet, it 
began to "lose directional control," and the pilot reduced power to the left engine. The airplane 
impacted a traffic light prior to landing on the road. After touchdown, the airplane began to 
skid to the right and impacted several objects before it came to rest, and a postcrash fire 
ensued.
Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed the 
right engine cockpit controls were in the "aft position," (right propeller lever in feather 
position) and the right propeller was not feathered. Both wing fuel tanks were ruptured; 
however, evidence of fuel was present in both wings.
The right engine was disassembled, under the supervision of an FAA inspector. According to 
the FAA inspector, the engine crankshaft had sheared between the No. 2 and No. 3 main 
bearings. The engine camshaft had also sheared at the No. 5 cylinder. 
The crankshaft and camshaft were sent to the National Transportation Safety Board's Materials 
Laboratory. Examination of the components revealed fatigue propagation over the majority of 
the crankshaft fracture surface. The camshaft sustained impact damage and was completely 
fractured in overstress bending and torsion.
Examination of the aircraft and engine logbooks revealed the most recent 100-hour inspection 
was completed on January 16, 2007. The most recent overhaul of the right engine was 
completed in July 1996, after a propeller strike incident. During the overhaul, the cylinders 
were "cermichrome" processed, repaired and certified. The crankshaft was "inspected and 
certified," and the crankcase was "repaired and certified." Since the overhaul, 11 years prior to 
the accident, the engine accumulated 471 hours.
Weather reported at FXE, at 1953, included wind from 240 degrees at 3 knots, 10 miles 
visibility, scattered clouds at 2,500 feet, overcast clouds at 15,000 feet, temperature 27 degrees 
Celsius (C), dew point 23 degrees C, and barometric pressure setting of 29.90 inches mercury.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
