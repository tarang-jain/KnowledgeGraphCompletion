Analysis   
The student pilot reported that she was on her first solo flight and her first landing attempt 
when she flared "too early, bounced hard and ballooned."  She said that she attempted to 
recover, but bounced a second time, and went off the left side of the runway as she aborted the 
landing.  The airplane struck a runway sign, and sustained substantial damage.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's inadequate recovery from a bounced landing, which resulted in the airplane 
impacting a runway sign.  A factor in the accident was the student pilot's misjudged landing 
flare.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
