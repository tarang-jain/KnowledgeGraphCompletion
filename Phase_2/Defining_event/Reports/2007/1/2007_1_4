Location:
Tulsa, OK
Accident Number:
DFW07LA052
Date & Time:
01/02/2007, 1140 CST 
Registration:
YV-2045
Aircraft:
Fairchild Merlin SA-226-T
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
9 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Business
Analysis 
The twin pressurized turboprop airplane veered to the left and departed the runway during 
landing on runway 19R.  Runway 19R was reported to be a 5,102-foot long by 100-foot wide 
asphalt runway.  The airplane came to rest on the grass between runway 13 and taxiway Juliet.  
The pilot reported that following a normal full-flap landing, the airplane started to veer to the 
left as soon as the nose wheel tires touched down on the runway.  The pilot was not able to 
compensate for the uncommanded drift as result of the nose wheel steering mechanism.  The 
airplane sustained structural damage to the nose section & nose wheel assembly. The 7 
passengers and 2 crewmembers egressed the airplane normally and sustained no injuries.  The 
reason for the uncommanded left drift could not be determined.  A completed NTSB Form 
6120.1 was not received from either one of the pilots nor the operator.  The weather was 
reported as calm winds, 10 statute miles visibility, clear skies, temperature 45 degrees 
Fahrenheit, dew point 28 degrees Fahrenheit, and a barometric pressure setting of 30.41 
inches of Mercury.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of control as result of the malfunction of the nose wheel steering mechanism during 
landing for undetermined reasons.

Factual Information
On January 2, 2007, at 1140 central standard time, a twin-engine Fairchild Merlin SA-226-T 
airplane, Venezuelan registration YV-2045, was substantially damaged following a loss of 
control while landing at the Richard L. Jones Jr. Airport (KRVS) near Tulsa, Oklahoma.  The 
airplane was owned and operated by a private individual in Caracas, Venezuela.  The airline 
transport rated pilot, the commercial pilot functioning as first officer, and the 7 passengers 
were not inured.  Visual meteorological conditions for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 
91 business flight.  The flight originated at the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport (KFXE), near 
Fort Lauderdale, Florida, at 0740, with KRVS as its intended destination. 
Tower personnel reported that the twin-engine airplane veered to the left and departed the 
runway during the landing roll on Runway 19R.  Runway 19R was reported to be a 5,102-feet 
long, by 100-feet wide asphalt runway.  The airplane came to an abrupt stop in the grassy area 
between Runway 13 and Taxiway Juliet, after the nose landing gear assembly dug into the soft 
ground and collapsed.  
The pilot reported that following a "normal" full-flap landing, he was unable to maintain 
directional control of the airplane due to the failure of the nose wheel steering mechanism.  
The airplane entered an uncommanded left drift which he could not compensate for.  The 
airplane departed the left side of the runway.    
Examination of the pressurized twin-turboprop airplane revealed structural damage to the 
lower portion of the nose section, as well as damage to the support structure for the nose 
landing gear assembly.  All propeller blades were damaged upon ground contact.  None of the 4 
main tires were blown and the wheel brakes appeared to be functioning and in good condition.  
There was no fire.  The 7 passengers and 2 crewmembers were able to egress the airplane 
normally and  were not injured.  
The reason for the uncommanded nose wheel steering deflection could not be determined.  A 
completed NTSB Form 6120.1/2 was not received from either the operator or the pilot.  
The weather was reported as calm winds, visibility 10 miles, clear skies, temperature 45 
degrees Fahrenheit, dew point 28 degrees Fahrenheit, and a barometric pressure setting of 
30.41 inches of Mercury.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
