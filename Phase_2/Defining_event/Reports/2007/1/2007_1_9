Analysis   
The pilot was performing a takeoff on runway 05, a 2,200-foot long asphalt runway.   About 
three quarters down the runway, the pilot attempted to rotate the airplane, but it did not 
respond well.  The pilot then noted that the airspeed indicator appeared to indicate less than 
the 65-knot speed needed to continue with rotation.  At that time, the pilot aborted the takeoff; 
and the airplane overran the runway and strucks rocks.  Winds were reported as calm at the 
time of the accident.  The pilot also reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or 
failures with the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot-in-command's delayed aborted takeoff, which resulted in a runway overrun and 
collision with terrain. A factor was the rocks off the end of the runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
