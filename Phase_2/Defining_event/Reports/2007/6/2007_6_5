Analysis   
The airplane experienced a loss of engine power and nosed over in a field during the forced 
landing.  The pilot reported that after flying for about 40 minutes he noticed the oil 
temperature gauge begin to rise.  He had started looking for a suitable place to land when the 
oil temperature and engine temperature gauges both went beyond the red line.  At 2,500 feet 
the engine made loud metallic clanking noises and began to shake violently.  He shut the 
engine down and proceeded to make an emergency landing in a plowed field.  The airplane 
nosed over during the ground roll.  Examination of the antique Ford Model B engine revealed 
that the connecting rod for the number 2 piston failed.  The time since last overhaul on the 
engine was 6 hours.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
a loss of power due to the failure of the number 2 connecting rod.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
