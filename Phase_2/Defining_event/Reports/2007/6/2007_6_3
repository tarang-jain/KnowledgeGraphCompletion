Analysis   
The pilot overran the departure end of the grass runway during a precautionary landing 
following a partial loss of engine power.  The 1,393-hour commercial pilot reported hearing a 
loud noise while in cruise flight, followed by a partial loss of engine power.  The pilot attempted 
to land the high performance single-engine airplane on a 1,400-foot-long, by 75-foot-wide 
grass runway.  The pilot, who had accumulated a total of 320-hours in the same make and 
model, reported that he "elected to set the plane down, knowing I would go-off the end of the 
runway."  The homebuilt airplane overran the departure end of the grass runway and collided 
with trees and terrain.  Both wings sustained structural damage.  The pilot exited through the 
canopy with minor injuries.  The pilot reported that the 260-horsepower engine had 
accumulated a total of 265-hours, with 7-hours since its last inspection.  The reason for the 
partial loss of power could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power for undetermined reason.  A contributing factor was the lack of 
suitable terrain for the precautionary landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
