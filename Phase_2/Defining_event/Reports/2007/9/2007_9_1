Factual Information
On September 1, 2007, about 1230 Alaska daylight time, a twin-engine turboprop Short 
Brothers SC-7 airplane, N2088Z, sustained substantial damage when the nose landing gear 
strut collapsed during the landing roll at a remote lodge airstrip, about 82 miles east-northeast 
of McGrath, Alaska.  The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-
country nonscheduled cargo flight under Title 14, CFR Part 135, when the accident occurred.  
The airplane was operated by Arctic Circle Air Service Inc., Fairbanks, Alaska.  The airline 
transport certificated pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured.  The flight originated at the 
Fairbanks International Airport about 1030.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a 
VFR flight plan was filed.
During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
investigator-in-charge (IIC), on September 4, the director of operations for the operator 
reported that the pilot was landing toward the northwest at the Mystic Lake Lodge.  The gravel 
surfaced runway was about 1,000 feet long, and about 40 feet wide.  During the landing roll, 
the nose landing gear strut collapsed when it encountered soft terrain.
On September 10, the director of maintenance for the operator reported that the fuselage 
received structural damage aft of the nose gear when the nose gear collapsed.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
