Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The experimental powered parachute aircraft collided with a fence during an aborted takeoff, 
resulting in serious injuries to the pilot.  The student pilot's first takeoff and landing were 
uneventful.  Prior to commencing the second takeoff in calm wind conditions, the pilot 
"checked and double checked [the] chute and aircraft...everything checked out."  The pilot 
applied engine power and began taking off from the 40-acre field.  The chute did not 
completely open and it appeared to be tucked in on the right side, which resulted in the chute 
drifting left.  The pilot did not maintain directional control of his aircraft, and at 20 feet above 
the ground he elected to abort the climb as he approached the runway's end.  The airplane 
impacted a nearby fence at full throttle.    
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the parachute wing to completely deploy, which resulted in the pilot's failure to 
maintain directional control during takeoff.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
