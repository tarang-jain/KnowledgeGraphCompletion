Analysis 
THE CESSNA 172 PILOT PERFORMED HIS PREFLIGHT ENGINE RUN-UP ON THE 
TAXIWAY, THEN WAITED FOR A TWIN ENGINE AIRCRAFT TO LAND. HE REPORTED 
THAT AFTER THE TWIN ENGINE LANDED, HE RADIOED HIS INTENTION, DOUBLE 
CHECKED THE FINAL APPROACH AREA, AND WITH NO OTHER AIRCRAFT IN SIGHT, 
HE TAXIED ONTO THE RUNWAY. WHILE THE CESSNA 172 PILOT WAS WAITING FOR 
THE TWIN ENGINE AIRCRAFT TO LAND, A BOEING A75N1 (STEARMAN) PILOT 
EXTENDED HIS PATTERN AND TURNED ON A LONG FINAL APPROACH. THE 
STEARMAN PILOT REPORTED THAT HE DID THIS TO ALLOW THE TWIN ENGINE 
PLANE TO LAND AHEAD OF HIM. AS THE STEARMAN PILOT CONTINUED, HE DID NOT 
SEE THE BEIGE COLORED CESSNA 172 TAXI ONTO THE RUNWAY. HE REPORTED THAT 
THE VISIBILITY WAS POOR FROM THE BACK SEAT. ALSO, THE STEARMAN WAS NOT 
EQUIPPED WITH A RADIO. AS THE CESSNA PILOT ADVANCED HIS POWER TO 
TAKEOFF, HIS LEFT WING WAS STRUCK BY THE STEARMAN'S LANDING GEAR.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
