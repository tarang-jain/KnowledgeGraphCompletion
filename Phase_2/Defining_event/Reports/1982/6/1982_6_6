Analysis 
THE PILOT REPORTED THAT AFTER LANDING AT OZARK, AR, NO FUEL WAS 
AVAILABLE. THEREFORE, HE PROCEEDED TO OBTAIN FUEL AT CLARKSVILLE, AR, A 
DISTANCE OF ABOUT 15 MILES. AFTER TAKEOFF, HE ENCOUNTERED MODERATE 
TURBULENCE, LEVELED AT ABOUT 600 FT, AND REDUCED POWER IN ORDER TO 
REDUCE THE BOUNCING. HE THEN PREOCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH LOCATING 
CLARKSVILLE AND THE AIRPORT ON THE SECTIONAL CHART. AS HE WAS DOING 
THIS, HE FELT THE AIRCRAFT SINK. FULL POWER WAS APPLIED, BUT THE SINK 
CONTINUED. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE AIRCRAFT STRUCK TRANSMISSION LINES WHICH 
THE PILOT HAD NOT SEEN PRIOR TO IMPACT. AFTER HITTING THE LINES, A FORCED 
LANDING WAS MADE ON A HIGHWAY MEDIAN WHERE THE NOSE GEAR SHEARED 
OFF. THE PILOT STATED THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD FLOWN OVER 
MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN AND IN ITS ASSOCIATED TURBULENCE.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
