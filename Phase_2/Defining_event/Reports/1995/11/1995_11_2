Analysis 
The pilot said he was unable to maintain directional control after landing on a wet grass 
airstrip. The airplane went off the left side of the runway and collided with a ditch.

and 10 feet left of centerline. The tracks angled off the left side of the runway and terminated at 
the airplane in the ditch. Winds reported at nearby Ardmore Municipal Airport were from 190 
degrees at 10 knots.

 On November 1, 1995, approximately 1620 central standard time, a Cessna 152, N49131, 
operated by Bridgeport Flight Center, was substantially damaged when it collided with terrain 
during landing at Marietta, Oklahoma.  The private pilot and passenger were not injured.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time, and no flight plan was filed for the

Bridgeport, Texas, approximately 1530.
In the Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report, the pilot chose not to make a written

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
