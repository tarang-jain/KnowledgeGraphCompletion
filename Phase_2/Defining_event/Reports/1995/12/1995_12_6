Factual Information
 On December 2, 1995, at about 1000 eastern standard time, a Cessna 152, N89188, piloted by 
a student pilot on a solo instructional flight, sustained substantial damage when it departed the 
runway and struck a ditch during an aborted short field takeoff attempt at Stanton County 
Airport, in Stanton, Kentucky.  The student pilot, the sole occupant, reported no  injuries.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, no flight plan was filed.  The flight 
operated under 14 CFR Part 91, and the accident occurred during an attempted takeoff.    
The student pilot told the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector that he was 
practicing solo takeoffs and landings at Stanton, Kentucky.  He stated that when he attempted 
his second takeoff (a short field takeoff), he lost directional control, and ran off the left side of 
the runway into a shallow ditch.  The FAA inspector stated that the student pilot indicated that 
the accident was "...the result of his mistake... ."  The registered owner/operator's 
recommendation as to how the accident could have been prevented was: "More training."  The 
student pilot reported that he had 16.5 hours of total flight time, including 3.2 hours as pilot-
in-command.  A postaccident inspection of the aircraft by a Federal Aviation Administration 
safety inspector revealed no preimpact mechanical anomalies.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
