Analysis 
WHILE ON FINAL APPROACH FOR LANDING, THE PILOT NOTED EQUIPMENT ON THE 
RUNWAY AND OPTED TO GO-AROUND. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE THEN CIRCLED 
AROUND TO LAND IN THE GRASSY AREA NEXT TO THE RUNWAY. AT 20 TO 50 FEET 
AGL, THE PILOT NOTED A CULVERT AND ADDED POWER AND PULLED UP TO GO-
AROUND; HOWEVER, THE AIRPLANE STALLED AND STARTED TO LOSE ALTITUDE. 
THE PILOT LOWERED THE NOSE TO INCREASE AIRSPEED BUT THE NOSE WHEEL 
CONTACTED THE GROUND AND THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER. THE PILOT STATED 
THAT HE WAS NOT AWARE OF THE NOTAM IN EFFECT THAT REPORTED THE

Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AIRSPEED.  THE PILOT'S  INADEQUATE 
PREFLIGHT PLANNING/PREPARATION AND SELECTION OF UNSUITABLE TERRAIN 
FOR LANDING WERE FACTORS.

Factual Information
 On August 1, 1995, at 1430 mountain daylight time, a Cessna 172C, N1364Y, collided with the 
terrain and nosed over during the landing roll at Red Lodge Airport, Red Lodge, Montana.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed.  The 
airplane was substantially damaged and the private pilot and his passenger were not injured.  
The flight had departed from Worland, Wyoming, on August 1, 1995, at 1315, for the personal 
flight.
During a telephone interview and subsequent written statement, the pilot reported that he 
made two passes over the runway to check for the wind conditions.  The pilot determined that 
the wind was calm and made an approach to runway 34.  While on final approach, the pilot 
noted a truck in the middle of the runway and he opted to go-around.  The pilot stated that he 
decided to look for a grassy area next to the runway and made an approach to the side of 
runway 16.  During the soft field landing with 30 degrees of flaps extended and at 
approximately 20 to 50 feet above ground level, the pilot noticed a culvert and pulled up to go-
around.  The pilot stated that the airplane stalled and began to lose altitude.  The pilot lowered 
the nose to increase airspeed, however, the nose wheel contacted the ground and the airplane 
nosed over.
A specialist at the Casper Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) reported that the pilot had 
made contact with the facility while in-flight and requested the weather in the Red Lodge area 
and also requested the Worland altimeter setting.  The specialist stated that the pilot did not 
request a full briefing, only the current weather.  There is no record that the pilot obtained a 
pre-flight briefing prior to the flight.
A Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) was in effect for the Red Lodge Airport.  The NOTAM reported 
that runway 16-34 was closed from August 1, 1995 at 0800, until August 3, 1995, at 0500, to 
spray oil on the runway.  The pilot reported that he was not aware of the NOTAM.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
