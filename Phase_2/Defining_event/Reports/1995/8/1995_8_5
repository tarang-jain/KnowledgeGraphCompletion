Analysis 
THE PILOT IN THE NUMBER 3 AIRCRAFT, IN POSITION ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE 
RUNWAY, COLLIDED WITH THE NUMBER 2 AIRCRAFT, POSITIONED FOR TAKEOFF ON

TAKING OFF WITH THE LEAD AIRCRAFT AND INITIATED HIS TAKEOFF ROLL AFTER 
COUNTING TO 5 SECONDS.  THE NUMBER 2 PILOT STATED THAT THE GROUP OF 
PILOTS DECIDED EARLIER ON INTERVAL TAKEOFFS DUE TO THE NARROW RUNWAY. 
Probable Cause and Findings

the failure of the pilot to follow pre-briefed instructions, and failure to see and avoid the 
preceding aircraft awaiting takeoff.

Factual Information
 On August 1, 1995, at 0900 hours mountain standard time, a North American AT-6B, 
N105DG, collided with another AT-6, N90629, on the runway at the beginning of a takeoff roll 
at the airport in Glendale, Arizona.  Visual meteorological conditions existed at the time for the 
pleasure flight to El Paso, Texas.  The AT-6 (N90629) awaiting takeoff on the runway received 
substantial damage when the AT-6 (N105DG) behind it started its takeoff roll and collided with 
the wing of N90629.  The two pilots and one passenger were not injured.
The two aircraft were part of a group of five WW-II Warbirds departing single ship from 
runway 01 for an across-the-country tour of aircraft celebrating the end of the World War II.
The investigation revealed that N105DG was number 3 in the group of similar aircraft to 
takeoff.  The number 1 aircraft began its take off with about 5 seconds separation for spacing.  
The number 2 aircraft (N90629) was waiting his turn, as briefed, for takeoff when the collision 
occurred.  The pilot of the number 3 aircraft stated to an Federal Aviation Administration 
inspector that he didn't understand the pretakeoff pilot briefing regarding the takeoff 
procedures.  He initiated his takeoff and his left wing collided with the right wing of the 
number 2 aircraft.
The pilot of N105DG stated in his report that he understood that the number 2 aircraft would 
be making a formation takeoff with the lead aircraft.  All aircraft taxied onto the runway and he 
then lined up on the right side of the runway with the number 1 aircraft in view.  He observed 
the lead aircraft begin its takeoff roll and assumed that the number 2 aircraft was rolling within 
formation with him.  The pilot counted 5 to 6 seconds for spacing and started his takeoff roll.  
He angled to the left to align the aircraft with the runway centerline and then straightened out 
on the runway centerline.  At this time, the pilot observed the number 2 aircraft still stationary 
in front and to the left.  He attempted to avoid a collision by going to the right but was 
unsuccessful.  The left wing of N105DG collided with the right wing of N90629.
The pilot of N90629 stated in his report that he pulled nearly abeam of the lead aircraft and 
stopped.  After lead began his takeoff roll, he began to count before he released his brakes.  As 
he reached the count of 4 seconds, N105DG went by on the right and collided with his right 
wing.  He further stated that the group had briefed at 0800 that morning and it was decided 
that an interval takeoff would be made because the runway was too narrow.
Runway 01 at the Glendale airport is 5,350 feet in length and 75 feet wide.
The pilot in N105DG stated he was seated in the rear seat.  The front seat was occupied by a 
pilot rated passenger.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
