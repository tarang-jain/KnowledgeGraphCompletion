Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE PILOT WAS ON HIS FIRST SOLO FLIGHT IN A CONVENTIONAL GEAR AIRPLANE, 
PRACTICING TAKEOFFS AND LANDINGS ON A SNOW COVERED RUNWAY. HE STATED 
THAT AFTER TWO LANDINGS IN CALM AIR, THE WEATHER UNEXPECTEDLY 
CHANGED, AND HE ENCOUNTERED GUSTY WIND CONDITIONS. ON THE THIRD 
LANDING, THE AIRPLANE BOUNCED AND EXITED THE RUNWAY. A GROUND WITNESS 
SAID THAT THE PILOT APPLIED POWER AND INITIATED A GO-AROUND; HOWEVER, 
MOMENTARILY AFTER LIFT-OFF, THE RIGHT WING DROPPED AND STRUCK THE 
GROUND. THE AIRPLANE THEN SPUN AROUND AND CAME TO REST WITH 
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S IMPROPER RECOVERY FR0M A BOUNCED LANDING, AND HIS FAILURE 
TO ATTAIN ADEQUATE AIRSPEED IN UNFAVORABLE WIND CONDITIONS FOR AN 
ATTEMPTED GO-AROUND (ABORTED LANDING), WHICH RESULTED IN A 
STALL/MUSH AND A DRAGGED WINGTIP.  FACTORS RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT 
WERE: THE PILOT'S LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN CONVENTIONAL GEAR (TAILWHEEL) 
AIRCRAFT, UNFAVORABLE WIND CONDITIONS, AND FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO 
MAINTAIN RUNWAY ALIGNMENT DURING THE BOUNCED LANDING.

Factual Information
 On February 2, 1995, at 0918 hours Pacific standard time, an Aeronca 7AC, N83981, crashed 
shortly after taking off on runway 26 at Big Bear City Airport, Big Bear City, California.  The 
pilot was conducting a visual flight rules personal flight and was practicing takeoffs and 
landings.  The airplane, registered to and operated by the student pilot, sustained substantial 
damage.  The certificated private pilot, the sole occupant, sustained minor injuries.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed.  The flight departed Big Bear City Airport at an 
undetermined time.
The pilot told a San Bernardino County Sheriff deputy that the airplane bounced during the 
landing.  He said that he was unable to arrest the bounced landing and the airplane exited the 
runway.
A ground witness told the deputy that the airplane landed normally on the snow-covered 
runway, but during the landing roll, the airplane "got squirrely" and the airplane veered off the 
north side of the runway.  The pilot applied power and initiated a takeoff.  The airplane 
momentarily became airborne, but its right wing dropped and struck the ground.  The airplane 
spun to the right and came to rest on the ground.
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operations inspector from the Riverside (California) 
Flight Standards District Office said the pilot was conducting his first solo flight in 
conventional gear airplanes.  The accident occurred on the third landing.
The pilot said in the aircraft accident report that on the third landing the winds unexpectedly 
changed and he was unable to avoid stalling the airplane at 30 feet above the ground.  The 
airplane landed hard on the median area north of the runway and south of the taxiway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
