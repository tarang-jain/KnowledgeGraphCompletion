Factual Information
 On July 1, 1995, at 1400 hours Pacific daylight time, a Showalter Tern Sailplane glider, N7322, 
dragged the right wing tip during an aero tow departure on runway 07 at Krey Field, Adelanto, 
California.  The pilot was beginning a local visual flight rules personal flight.  The glider, 
registered to and operated by the pilot, sustained substantial damage.  The certificated private 
pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The pilot reported this accident to the National Transportation Safety Board on July 7, 1995.  
He said that during the aero tow, the glider right wing tip dragged the runway and then "spun 
around."  The right wing folded and the tail section separated.  He also said the airplane did 
not experience any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures, and that the surface winds 
were calm.
The pilot said in the accident report that the glider departed runway 07.  When the pilot 
initially reported this accident to the Safety Board on July 7, 1995, he said the airplane 
departed runway 29.  He also indicated in the report that the surface winds were from the 
southeast between 0 and 15 knots.
In the accident report, the pilot said that during the aero tow the left wing raised.  He applied 
left aileron, but there was insufficient aileron control and the right wing continued downward 
until it struck the ground.  The aero tow airplane pilot released the glider when the glider right 
wing struck the ground.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
