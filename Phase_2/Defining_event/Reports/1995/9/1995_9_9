THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN A PROPER RATE OF DESCENT DURING THE 
APPROACH TO LAND, AND HIS MISJUDGMENT OF ALTITUDE TO FLARE FOR LANDING 
ON GLASSY WATER.  THE GLASSY WATER CONDITION WAS A RELATED FACTOR.

Factual Information
 On September 2, 1995, about 1530 Alaska daylight time, a float  equipped Champion 7GCBC, 
N9033L, crashed during landing on a lake, about 6 miles southwest of Big Lake, Alaska.  The 
airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) local area personal flight when the 
accident occurred.  The airplane, owned and operated by the pilot, sustained substantial 
damage.  The certificated commercial pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed.  The flight originated at the Lake Hood Seaplane base, 
Anchorage, Alaska, about 1500.
The pilot reported that he was landing on 7 Mile Lake in a northeasterly direction and was 
performing a curving approach to glassy water.  During the landing approach, the airplane 
developed a high rate of descent.  Just before touchdown, the pilot added engine power but the 
airplane experienced a hard landing on the water.  The airplane received damage to the left 
float, left float strut, and fuselage.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
