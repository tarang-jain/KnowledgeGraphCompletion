Factual Information
 On September 1, 1995, approximately 1430 Pacific daylight time (PDT), an experimental 
Bristol RV-6, N694CA, nosed-over during an emergency landing near Josephine County 
Airport, Grants Pass, Oregon. The commercial pilot, who was the sole occupant, was not 
injured, but the aircraft sustained substantial damage. The local personal pleasure flight, which 
had just departed Josephine County Airport, was being operated in visual meteorological 
conditions at the time of the accident. No flight plan had been filed, and there was no report of 
an ELT activation.
According to the FAA inspector who responded to the accident, the aircraft lost power shortly 
after takeoff, and the pilot attempted an emergency landing in a nearby field. During the 
landing sequence, the aircraft nosed-over in high vegetation. After the accident, the owner 
inspected the engine, and reported that he did not find any anomalies or reason for the loss of 
power. The engine has subsequently been reinstalled on an aircraft, and according to the 
owner, has operated without problem.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
