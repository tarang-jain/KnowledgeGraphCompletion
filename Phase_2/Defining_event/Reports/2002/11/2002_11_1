11/01/2002, 1345 AST 
Registration:
N8199
Aircraft:
Arima Kolb Fire Star II
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial

1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot/owner reported that the experimental homebuilt airplane had been stored 
outside, and had not been utilized within the last two years.  He said that just prior to the 
accident, he had accomplished three successful touch-and-go landings.  During the fourth 
takeoff roll, the airplane climbed to about 50 feet above the runway, and the Rotax 503 engine 
suddenly lost significant power.  During the subsequent forced landing, the airplane collided 
with several trees.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and 
empennage.  An FAA inspector inspected the airplane and reported that both carburetor float 
bowls contained murky, silty, and rust-colored fuel.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate preflight inspection which failed to remove contaminated fuel from the 
airplane's fuel system, resulting in a loss of engine power during takeoff.

Factual Information
On November 1, 2002, about 1345 Alaska standard time, a wheel-equipped experimental 
homebuilt Arima Kolb Fire Star II airplane, N8199, sustained substantial damage when it 
struck trees during a forced landing after takeoff from the Birchwood Airport, Chugiak, Alaska.  
The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) local area personal flight under 
Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred.  The airplane was operated by the pilot. The 
solo private pilot was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  The flight 
originated at the Birchwood Airport about 1300.  No flight plan was filed.   
During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
investigator-in-charge on November 1, the pilot reported that the accident airplane had been 
stored outside, and had not been utilized within the last two years.  He added that just prior to 
the accident, he had accomplished three successful touch-and-go landings on runway 19R.  He 
said that on the fourth touch-and-go landing roll, he added power for another takeoff.  As the 
airplane climbed to about 50 feet above the runway, he said the engine, a Rotax 503, suddenly 
lost significant power, and he selected a forced landing area ahead of the airplane.  During the 
forced landing, the airplane collided with several trees.  The airplane sustained substantial 
damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage.
On November 1, a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operations inspector, Anchorage 
Flight Standards District Office, traveled to the Birchwood Airport to inspect the airplane.  The 
inspector reported that both carburetor float bowls were found to contain murky, silty, and 
rust-colored fuel.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
