Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Rio Vista, CA
Accident Number:
LAX02LA078
Date & Time:
02/02/2002, 1300 PST 
Registration:
N2221X
Aircraft:
Robinette Ultra Pup
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The experimental, amateur-built airplane landed off-airport following a total loss of engine 
power on climbout.  The pilot reported that during the initial climb after a slow-flight, low pass 
down the 4,200-foot-long runway and while about 200 feet above ground level, the engine lost 
all power although the propeller continued to windmill.  After the accident, there was about 9 
gallons of 100-octane aviation fuel aboard.  Earlier the same day he had flown a prior flight leg 
on the same tank of fuel.  The pilot suspected that carburetor icing was the cause of the engine 
loss of power.  The airplane was equipped with a Mosler converted automotive engine, and was 
equipped with carburetor heat.  The carburetor heat control was in the "on" position when 
engine power was lost.  A generic carburetor icing probability chart used by the Safety Board 
showed the ambient temperature and dew point conditions to have been within the region 
marked "serious icing - cruise or climb power."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.

Factual Information
On February 2, 2002, at 1300 Pacific standard time, a Robinette Ultra Pup, N2221X, landed 
off-airport following total a loss of engine power on climbout from Rio Vista Municipal Airport, 
Rio Vista, California.  The private certificated pilot and pilot-rated passenger were not injured.  
The experimental, amateur-built  airplane was substantially damaged.  The local area personal 
flight was operated by the owner under 14 CFR Part 91.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and no flight plan was filed.
The pilot reported that during the initial climb after a slow-flight, low pass down runway 25 
(4,200feet long by 75 feet wide), while about 200 feet above ground level, the engine lost all 
power although the propeller continued to windmill.  After the accident, there was about 9 
gallons of 100-octane aviation fuel aboard.  Earlier the same day he had flown from Concord, 
California, to Rio Vista on the same tank of fuel.  The pilot suspected that carburetor icing was 
the cause of the engine loss of power.  The airplane was equipped with a Mosler converted 
automotive engine, and was equipped with carburetor heat.  The carburetor heat control was in 
the "on" position when engine power was lost.
A generic carburetor icing probability chart used by the Safety Board showed the ambient 
temperature and dew point conditions to have been within the region marked "serious icing - 
cruise or climb power."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
