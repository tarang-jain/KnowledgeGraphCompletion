Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
While the student pilot was landing on runway 11, about 5 feet above the runway, a gust of 
wind was encountered, which lifted the right wing.  The left main landing gear touched down 
and the gear spring twisted.  The airplane began to drift to the left, and after the CFI "gave the 
student a second or two to recover from this position,"  he took the controls.  Continuing to 
veer, the airplane departed the left side of the runway, where the left main landing gear 
collapsed.  The airplane came to rest in a grass area.  The left main landing gear spring was 
retained for further examination.  According to the manufacturers technical report of the 
examination, the tubular spring for the left main landing gear fractured at the inboard end.  
The inboard end of the spring contained a longitudinal oriented fracture that intersected a 
fastener hole.  The fracture face contained chevron marks typical of an overstress fracture that 
pointed back to the hole, indicating that the fracture emanated from the fastener hole.  No 
evidence of corrosion was noted on the fracture region.  Further examination revealed that the 
fastener hole contained machining marks and fretting.  Review of the airplane's maintenance 
records revealed that the landing gear struts were removed from the fuselage, and floats were 
installed, in 1992.  After about 2,158 hours of service, the floats were removed, and the original 
landing gear struts were re-installed.  The airplane had accumulated about 3,598 hours of total 
service.  The CFI reported that the winds at the airport, about the time of the accident, were 
from 180 degrees at 8 knots, gusting to 17 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's loss of aircraft control which resulted in a hard landing, and the CFI's 
delayed remedial action.  Factors related to the accident were the fatigue cracks which initiated 
at the attachment hole on the landing gear strut, and the crosswind conditions.

Factual Information
On March 2, 2002, about 1140 eastern standard time, a Cessna 172P, N65021, was 
substantially damaged while landing at the Chester County Airport, Coatesville, Pennsylvania.  
The certified flight instructor (CFI) and student pilot were not injured.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the instructional flight conducted under 14 
CFR Part 91.
According to the CFI, the student was landing on runway 11, a 5,400-foot long, 100-foot wide, 
asphalt runway.  About 5 feet above the runway, a gust of wind was encountered, which lifted 
the right wing.  The left main landing gear touched down, and the gear spring twisted.  The 
airplane began to drift to the left, and after the CFI "gave the student a second or two to recover 
from this position,"  he took the controls.  Continuing to veer, the airplane departed the left 
side of the runway, where the left main landing gear collapsed.  The airplane came to rest in a 
grass area.
The left main landing gear spring was retained for further examination at the Cessna Aircraft 
Company Materials Laboratory.
According to the manufacturer's technical report of the examination, the tubular spring for the 
left main landing gear fractured at the inboard end.  The inboard end of the spring contained a 
longitudinal oriented fracture that intersected a fastener hole.  The fracture face contained 
chevron marks typical of an overstress fracture that pointed back to the hole, indicating that 
the fracture emanated from the fastener hole.  The overstress fracture region extended for 
about 3.5 inches from the hole.  No evidence of corrosion was noted on the fracture region.  
Further examination of the fastener hole revealed that it contained machining marks and 
fretting.  The composition and hardness of the material use to produce the spring were within 
manufacturer specifications.
Review of the airplane's maintenance records revealed that the landing gear struts were 
removed from the fuselage, and floats were installed, in 1992.  After about 2,158 hours of 
service, the floats were removed, and the original landing gear struts were re-installed.  The 
airplane had accumulated about 3,598 hours of total service.
The winds recorded at a nearby airport, at 1154, were from 150 degrees at 10 knots.  The CFI 
reported that the winds at 40N, about the time of the accident, were from 180 degrees at 8 
knots, gusting to 17 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
