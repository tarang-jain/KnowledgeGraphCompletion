Registration:
N46TP
Aircraft:
Hughes OH-6A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Public Aircraft
Analysis 
The commercial pilot, under the supervision of the flight instructor, initiated a full-touchdown 
autorotation in an unmowed, grassy practice area. After touchdown, the helicopter began a 
slow ground run for three to five feet with no abnormalities. The flight instructor and 
commercial pilot then reported a very hard hop, and the helicopter collided with the ground 
and began gyrating violently. Both pilots shut it down. Examination of the helicopter revealed 
the main rotor severed the tail boom, separating it from the airframe. The pilots reported no 
mechanical failures.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper flare during practice autorotation.
Findings
Occurrence #1: HARD LANDING
Phase of Operation: MANEUVERING
Findings
1. (C) FLARE - IMPROPER - PILOT IN COMMAND

Factual Information
On January 4, 2002, at 1505 eastern standard time, a Hughes OH-6A helicopter, N46TP, 
registered to, owned, and operated by the City of Tampa Police Department, collided with 
terrain during training maneuvers in a field near Tampa International Airport in Tampa, 
Florida. The public use instructional flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 CFR 
Part 91 with no flight plan filed. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the 
accident. The certificated flight instructor and the commercial pilot received minor injuries, 
and the helicopter sustained substantial damage. The flight departed the Tampa Police 
Aviation hangar in Tampa, Florida, at 1400.
The flight instructor was acting as check airman for the commercial pilot's annual airman 
competency/proficiency check. The commercial pilot completed several maneuvers before a 
full-touchdown autorotation was initiated in a dry, unmowed, grassy practice area west of the 
approach end of runway 27 at Tampa International Airport. The maneuver, from entry at 500 
feet above ground level to touchdown, was actively monitored by the flight instructor and was 
performed correctly with the rotor RPM, airspeed, attitude, and sink rate within parameters. 
The pilot initiated a flare at 100 feet above ground level, and, through final descent to the 
ground, lifted the collective to cushion the landing. The helicopter touched down in a slight 
nose-down attitude and began a slow ground run for three to five feet. The flight instructor and 
commercial pilot then reported a very hard "hop" that threw both upward against their 
shoulder harnesses, and the commercial pilot's helmet struck the upper doorjamb. The 
commercial pilot stated, "the helicopter then rose up left side low, then slammed into the 
ground, with the right side taking the brunt of the force." The helicopter then began gyrating 
violently, and both the flight instructor and commercial pilot shut it down.   
Examination of the helicopter revealed the main rotor blade severed the tail boom, separating 
the tail rotor and vertical/horizontal assembly from the airframe. One main rotor blade was 
separated, and the other main rotor blade displayed deformation. The pilots reported no 
mechanical failures.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
