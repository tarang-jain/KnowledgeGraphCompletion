Analysis 
The flight encountered severe turbulence while operating at 31,000 feet msl, and a flight 
attendant sustained a serious injury.  The encounter occurred near position 174 degrees 20 
minutes east longitude and 24 degrees 18 minutes south latitude.  According to the captain, 
prior to the turbulence event, the airplane was flying over a flat broken cloud layer with a 
smooth ride.  He reported, in part: "Passing 25 degrees south at FL310 we noticed that the 
cloud tops were gradually rising.  Radar showed very little - a few green returns off to the right.  
We were in an area of no forecasted turbulence or cumulonimbus buildups.  I turned on the 
seatbelt sign and made a passenger announcement."  The seriously injured flight attendant was 
in the process of securing the duty free cart when she was struck by it during the turbulence 
encounter.  Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) data showed that the airplane experienced a 
series of oscillating vertical and lateral accelerations that lasted almost 2 minutes.  The vertical 
accelerations (expressed in units of gravity or "g's", 1.0 is normal) ranged from a low of +0.31 
to a high of +1.7.   The lateral accelerations (a value of zero is normal) ranged from 0.119 left to 
0.115 right.  During the time frame of the encounter, the airplane's Flight Management 
Computer reported winds aloft went from 92 knots to 50, then back to 101.  The indicated 
airspeed also varied from a pre-encounter average value of 315 knots to a peak of 344 before 
returning to the nominal 315 value.  Review of the weather portion of the dispatch and flight 
release package provided to the flight crew noted that in the vicinity of 173 degrees east and 25 
degrees south the upper air winds between 31,000 and 35,000 feet were forecast to be from 
290 degrees at 102 to 113 knots.  The document also noted the possibility of turbulence from 
longitudes 164 degrees east to 172 degrees east along the planned flight track.  The National 
Weather Service Significant Weather Forecast Chart valid for the flight showed a 120 knot jet 
stream and the possibility of occasional moderate or lesser clear air turbulence south of the 
accident location and an area of isolated cumulo nimbus clouds with tops to 40,000 feet to the 
north.  The only SIGMETS in effect for turbulence concerned an area some 900 miles to the 
west and south of the accident location.

Factual Information
On May 1, 2002, at 0629 coordinated universal time (UTC), a Boeing 747-422, N182UA, 
encountered clear air turbulence while climbing through approximately 31,000 feet and while 
in international airspace over the Pacific ocean about 700 miles north of New Zealand.  
According to the airplane's onboard Flight Management Computer (FMC) recorded data, the 
aircraft was at location 174.0027 degrees east longitude and 24.4684 degrees south latitude 
when the encounter occurred.  The airline transport certificated pilot and remaining 3 flight 
crewmembers were not injured.  Of the 17 flight attendant crewmembers, 1 was seriously 
injured, 1 received minor injuries, and 15 were not injured.  Of the 269 passengers aboard, 5 
received minor injuries and 264 were not injured.  The airplane was not damaged.  The flight 
was operated by United Airlines, Incorporated, under 14 CFR Part 121, as flight 862, a regularly 
scheduled international passenger flight.  The flight departed from Sydney, Australia at 0353 
UTC and was destined for San Francisco, California.  Following the encounter with turbulence, 
the flight crew altered course and landed at Auckland, New Zealand at 1056 UTC.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed and the flight was operating on an instrument flight plan.
According to the Captain, the airplane was flying over a flat broken cloud layer with a smooth 
ride.  He said, "Passing 25 degrees south at FL310 we noticed that the cloud tops were 
gradually rising.  Radar showed very little - a few green returns off to the right.  We were in an 
area of no forecasted turbulence or cumulonimbus cloud buildups.  I turned on the seatbelt 
sign and made a passenger announcement, as it appeared we would soon be just above or in 
the cloud tops and I expected a few light bumps although the clouds looked benign.  After 
entering the top of the cloud layer...we encountered 10 - 15 seconds of sharp severe turbulence 
with momentary over speed warning and stick shaker."
The captain said that he called the Purser and he was advised of flight attendant and passenger 
injuries.  He contacted dispatch and was advised that he should divert to Auckland.  After 
consulting with an onboard doctor and a company doctor in Chicago, the airplane diverted.
According to one of the flight attendants, he was assigned the position number 4 at door 3 left 
outboard.  He said, "About 3 to 3 1/2 hours into the flight, the seat belt sign was illuminated.  
As per my duties, I went to check seat belts.  When I reached row 59 on the left side of the 
plane, the pilot announced that flight attendants should be seated.  At that moment, I sat down 
immediately on the floor between seats 59b and 59d.  I held on to the bar under seat 59b.  
Within seconds, the plane started to go through very, very, violent turbulence.  It started to fish 
tale...What I saw however was something totally different.  Two flight attendants had started 
counting the merchandise in the duty free carts."  He said he saw one of attendants counting 
the duty free merchandise was thrown to the left of the airplane along with the duty free cart.  
The other flight attendant near to the duty free cart was also injured.  The duty free cart ended 
up upside down, and all the merchandise was strewn over the floor.  The seriously injured 
flight attendant was struck by the duty free cart.
According to Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) data, at 0628:58 a series of oscillating 
vertical and lateral accelerations began that lasted until 0630:38.  The vertical accelerations 
(expressed in units of gravity or "g's", 1.0 is normal) ranged from a low of +0.31 to a high of 
+1.7.   The lateral accelerations (a value of zero is normal) ranged from 0.119 left to 0.115 right.  
During the time frame of the encounter, the FMC reported winds went from 92 knots to 50, 
then back to 101.  The indicated airspeed also varied from a pre-encounter average value of 315 
Page 4 of 7LAX02LA146
knots to a peak of 344 before returning to the nominal 315 value.
The investigation reviewed the dispatch and flight release package provided to the flight crew.  
The weather forecast portion of the document noted that in the vicinity of 173 degrees east and 
25 degrees south the upper air winds between 31,000 and 35,000 feet were forecast to be from 
290 degrees at 102 to 113 knots.  The document also noted the possibility of moderate or lesser 
turbulence from longitudes 164 degrees east to 172 degrees east along the planned flight track.  
Two SIGMETS were listed on the documents.  The first, SIGMET AMMC MW01 (valid from 
April 30 at 2200 UTC to May 1 at 0400 UTC) forecast severe clear air turbulence between 
25,000 and 35,000 feet, though the area concerned was some 900 nautical miles south and 
west of the accident location.  The second one, SIGMET NTAA NR01 (valid on May 1 from 
0200 to 0800 UTC) forecast isolated and embedded cumulo nimbus clouds with tops to 
46,000 feet over a wide area well west and north of the planned flight track.
The National Weather Service Significant Weather Forecast Chart issued at 1700 UTC on April 
30 and valid until 0600 UTC on May 1 showed a 120 knot jet stream and moderate or lesser 
clear air turbulence south of the accident location and an area of isolated cumulo nimbus 
clouds with tops to 40,000 feet to the north.  No SIGMETS were in effect for turbulence.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
