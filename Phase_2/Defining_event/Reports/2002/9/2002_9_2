Location:
ANCHORAGE, AK
Accident Number:
ANC02LA112
Date & Time:
09/01/2002, 1900 AKD 
Registration:
N6981B
Aircraft:
Piper PA-18
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private certificated pilot was landing at a remote airstrip. The landing strip, oriented 
southeast/northwest, is about 600 feet long, by 15 feet wide, and is positioned on a ridge of a 
mountain.  The pilot said he was landing toward the southeast, and touched down on the strip 
about 1/3 of its total distance beyond the landing threshold.  He applied the airplane's brakes, 
but the tires began to slide on wet grass.  The airplane departed off the end of the landing strip.  
The left main landing gear tire struck a hole about 300 feet past the end of the landing strip, 
and the left main landing gear was sheared off.  The airplane received damage to the propeller, 
the left wing lift strut, and the left wing.  The pilot reported that after the accident, he utilized a 
hand-held wind meter and discovered he had landed with about a 5 knot tailwind.  The 
Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident/Incident Report (NTSB Form 6120.1) submitted by the pilot, 
contained an optional area for recommendations as to how the accident could have been 
prevented.  The pilot indicated that his recommendation was, "Perform go-around instead of 
landing long."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to attain the proper touchdown point on a remote airstrip, and his failure to 
perform a go-around that resulted in the airplane overrunning the end of the strip.  Factors in 
the accident were the pilot's inadequate evaluation of a tailwind condition, and a wet landing 
surface.

Factual Information
On September 1, 2002, about 1900 Alaska daylight time, a tundra tire-equipped Piper PA-18 
airplane, N6981B, sustained substantial damage when the airplane collided with a ditch during 
an overrun while landing at a remote airstrip, about 32 miles west of Anchorage, Alaska.  The 
airplane was being operated as a Title 14, CFR Part 91 visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country 
personal flight when the accident occurred.  The airplane was operated by the pilot.  The 
private certificated pilot, and the sole passenger, were not injured.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed.  The flight originated at the Lake Hood Strip, Anchorage, about 1830.
During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
investigator-in-charge (IIC), on September 4, the pilot reported that he was landing near the 
top of Little Mount Susitna.  The landing strip, oriented southeast/northwest, is about 600 feet 
long, by 15 feet wide, and is positioned on a ridge of the mountain.  The pilot said he was 
landing toward the southeast, but touched down on the strip about 1/3 of its total distance 
beyond the landing threshold.  He applied the airplane brakes, but the airplane tires began to 
slide on wet grass.  The airplane departed off the end of the landing strip into an area of low 
bushes on a down sloping portion of the landing area.  The left main landing gear tire struck a 
hole about 300 feet past the end of the landing strip.  The airplane's left main landing gear was 
sheared off.  The pilot reported that after the accident, he utilized a hand-held wind meter, and 
discovered about a five knot tailwind.  The airplane received damage to the propeller and the 
left wing lift strut.  Additionally, the outboard end of the left wing was bent upward about 20 
degrees.
The Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident/Incident Report (NTSB Form 6120.1) submitted by the 
pilot, contained an optional area for recommendations as to how the accident could have been 
prevented.  The pilot indicated that his recommendation was, "Perform go-around instead of 
landing long."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
