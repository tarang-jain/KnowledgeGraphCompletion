Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The airplane encountered a dust devil during the takeoff ground roll, then it veered off the 
runway, and collided with a berm.  About 600 feet into the takeoff ground roll the airplane 
veered to the left and continued in that direction even with the pilot's counteractive control 
input.  During the event, the pilot reduced the power, the right main landing gear sheared off, 
and the airplane came to rest on the right wing and horizontal stabilizer.  Witnesses informed 
the pilot that they observed a dust devil approach the airplane during takeoff roll.  The pilot 
reported experiencing no anomalies with the airframe or engine prior to the event.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane upon encountering a dust devil 
during the takeoff roll.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
