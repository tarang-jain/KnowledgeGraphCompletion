Analysis   
The 18,738-hour pilot reported that while applying an aerial application of fertilizer to a field, 
the engine lost power.  The pilot initiated a forced landing to a nearby field.  During the forced 
landing, the airplane impacted trees and came to rest upright.  A post-impact fire comsumed 
most of the airframe.  Examination of the sooted engine revealed that the discharge pressure 
line (P3) at the fuel control unit was disconnected.  The threads at the "B" nut  were also 
covered with soot.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power resulting from a disconnected discharge pressure line at the fuel 
control unit.  A contributing factor was the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
