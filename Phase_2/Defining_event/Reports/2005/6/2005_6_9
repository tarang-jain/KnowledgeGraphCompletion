Registration:
N524J
Aircraft:
David S Robbins Christavia MK 1
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot performed a preflight inspection but stated that he failed to visually check the fuel 
quantity in the tanks.  Approximately 30 minutes into the flight, the engine started sputtering 
and the pilot turned on the electric fuel pump.  The engine lost power and efforts by the pilot to 
restart the engine were unsuccessful.  The pilot located a pasture for an emergency landing and 
was approximately 50 feet above the ground when he banked hard to the right to avoid four 
poles sticking out of the ground.  As the pilot continued to maneuver for the emergency 
landing, the airplane collided with the ground.  The post-accident examination of the airplane 
revealed that the fuel gauge was on 'E' and there was no fuel recovered from the fuel tanks. The 
examination of the airplane also revealed that the fuel tanks were not breached.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate preflight planning which resulted in fuel exhaustion and subsequent loss 
of engine power.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
