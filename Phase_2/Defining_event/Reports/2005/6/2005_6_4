Analysis   
After takeoff, the student pilot remained in the traffic pattern and intended to practice landings 
in the tail-wheeled airplane.  During the student pilot's first landing attempt, the airplane 
bounced, and touched down with a "left crab."  He attempted to straighten the airplane; 
however, it departed the left side of the runway and struck a fence.  The student pilot reported 
40 hours of total flight experience, which included about 30 hours in the same make and model 
as the accident airplane.  He did not report any mechanical malfunctions.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper recovery from a bounced landing and his failure to maintain 
directional control while landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
