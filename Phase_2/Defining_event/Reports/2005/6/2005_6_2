Analysis 
The airplane departed from controlled flight during a missed approach and collided with hilly 
terrain.  The non-instrument rated private pilot departed, at night, to an airport located about 
40 miles to the north.  While en route, the pilot contacted the terminal radar approach control 
(TRACON) specialist on duty and was subsequently advised that weather conditions were IFR 
at the pilot's intended destination airport.  The pilot responded by saying he was going to try to 
find a VFR route.  A review of archived radar data revealed that the accident airplane flew to 
various locations around the accident airport at altitudes above the underlying overcast cloud 
layer.  The pilot then contacted the TRACON specialist and requested the ILS runway 16R 
approach at the accident airport.  A review of air-to-ground communications tapes, transcripts, 
and archived radar data, revealed that the accident pilot was unable to intercept the glide slope 
and localizer for the ILS approach to runway 16R, or to maintain an assigned altitude or 
heading.  Examination of the radar data for the pilot's attempted ILS approach showed that the 
airplane crossed the final approach course, 161 degrees, from the west between the initial 
approach fix and the outer marker.  The airplane's track overshot the final approach course to 
the east and then corrected back so that it was on course at the outer marker.  The track then 
deviated to the east again and corrected back to the final approach course, which was then 
followed by a 90-degree turn away from the final approach course to the west.  The track 
proceeded westerly for 27 seconds, climbing from 2,100 to 2,500 feet and then down to 2,400 
feet.  The track turned south for 32 seconds, climbing from 2,400 feet to 3,000 feet.  The last 
leg of the track proceeded northwesterly for the final 12 seconds, and the altitude descended 
from 3,000 feet to 2,600 feet, to 2,400 feet, to the accident elevation at 1,253 feet.  Impact 
forces destroyed the airplane.  According to the airplane's owner, the attitude gyro indicated a 
10-degree left angle of bank when the airplane was in level flight.  No preaccident mechanical 
anomalies were discovered during the investigation.  At the time of the accident the reported 
weather was 1,400 feet overcast, with tops estimated at 3,000 feet.  The weather forecast 
products available at the time of the pilot's departure predicted marginal VFR to IFR 
conditions at the destination, with ceilings occasionally below 1,000 feet and visibilities below 
3 miles.
Probable Cause and Findings
Page 2 of 12LAX05FA193
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to attempt flight into instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted 
in the pilot's loss of aircraft control due to spatial disorientation.   Factors in the accident were 
haze and low ceilings, the night lighting condition, an undetermined attitude gyro problem, 
and the pilot's lack of qualification/experience for flight in instrument conditions.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On June 1, 2005, at 2306 Pacific daylight time, a Mooney M20C, N6574U, collided with terrain 
while executing the ILS RWY 16 localizer instrument approach at Van Nuys Airport, Van Nuys, 
California.  The private pilot operated the airplane under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91.  The 
pilot, the sole occupant, was fatally injured; the airplane was destroyed.  Instrument 
meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed.  The personal flight 
originated at Orange County Airport, California, at 2145, and was en route to the Whiteman 
Airport, Los Angeles, California.
Airport surveillance radar from Long Beach and Burbank recorded the airplane's flight path for 
a majority of the flight.  The radar record picks the airplane up at 2145:24, with a transponder 
code of 0222, off Orange Country Airport at 100 feet mean sea level (msl).  The track proceeds 
north at 1,400 feet msl, and at 2151:43, the transponder code is changed to 1200.  The track 
continues its northerly course at 4,300 feet to La Harbra Heights, and then turns northwest 
towards Pasadena.  At 2209:54, the track stops over Placerita Canyon State Park.  The track is 
reacquired over Santa Clarita at 2218:54, at an altitude of 2,500 feet msl.  The track proceeds 
southeast in a loop climbing to 3,500 feet over the I-5 freeway and Highway 14 intersection, 
and then backtracking northwest over Santa Clarita, where the track stops at 2226:52, 2,800 
feet msl.  The track is reacquired at 2227:38, at 3,200 feet over Santa Clarita.  From this point 
the track proceeds southwest over Simi Valley at 4,900 feet, then northwest up to Filmore at 
5,000 feet msl, west over Santa Paula, reverses course to proceed east along Hwy 126 to Santa 
Clarita at 4,500 feet where the track stops at 2257:04, and 3,200 feet msl.  The last segment of 
the track is acquired at 2257:27, at 4,500 feet, and proceeds east, then turns directly south 
towards the San Fernando Pass and Van Nuys Airport along the final approach course of the 
VNY ILS RWY16 published approach.  At 2304:22, about 5 miles north of the Van Nuys 
Airport, the track turns abruptly west and ends at the accident location 1 minute 14 seconds 
later.
Southern California TRACON controllers were in contact with the pilot during the majority of 
the flight.  Upon initial contact the pilot and controller discussed the weather conditions, and 
the controller advised that conditions everywhere were IFR (instrument flight rules).  The pilot 
proceeded north saying he intended to try to find a VFR (visual flight rules) route, and if he 
could not he would return and land.  At 2256:19, the pilot contacted SoCal Approach at 5,000 
feet over Santa Clarita and requested an ILS (instrument landing system) approach to Van 
Nuys runway 16R.  At 2256:53, the controller instructed the pilot to proceed to the final 
approach course and squawk 5213.  At 2258:04, the controller established radar contact 1 mile 
east of Magic Mountain, told the pilot to maintain VFR, and to expect IFR once he's on the 
localizer.  The controller gave the pilot a heading of 130 to intercept the localizer, and said he 
was cleared IFR once he was established on the localizer, and cleared for the ILS approach in to 
Van Nuys.  At 2300:23, the controller advised the pilot that he was left (east) of centerline.  The 
pilot responded that he was correcting.  At 2301:38, the controller advised the pilot to change 
frequencies and make his landing announcement on the tower frequency of 119.3.  The pilot 
acknowledged.  At 2304:42, the pilot announced on the SoCal Approach frequency that the he 
had some problems and he was climbing out.  The controller gave instructions to proceed 
southbound, climb, and maintain 5,000 feet.  The controller made two radio calls before the 
pilot responded, and the pilot said only that he was climbing to 5,000 feet.  That was the last 
Page 4 of 12LAX05FA193
communication with the pilot.  The pilot never specified what the problem was.
The owner of the airplane told the National Transportation Safety Board investigator that he 
had spoken to the pilot just before he left San Jose on the morning of June 1st.   The pilot 
planned to leave San Jose Airport and fly to Orange County Airport, meet a friend for dinner, 
then fly to Whiteman Airport, where he normally operates.  They discussed the weather, and 
the owner advised the pilot to monitor the weather closely.  Whiteman Airport is about 4 miles 
northeast of Van Nuys Airport.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
A review of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airman records revealed that the pilot held 
a private pilot certificate with a single engine land rating dated October 30, 2004.  The pilot did 
not hold an instrument rating.
The pilot held a third-class medical certificate that was issued on May 28, 2005.  It had the 
restriction that the pilot must wear corrective lenses.
Examination of a copy of the pilot logbook revealed that he had 205.6 hours of flight time as of 
his last entry dated January 30, 2005.  The total amount of simulated instrument time was 11.5 
hours and no actual instrument time was recorded.  The last entry that recorded an instrument 
flight was on May 2, 2004.  The pilot's latest biannual flight review was dated November 1, 
2003.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
The airplane was a 1963 Mooney M20C, serial number 2431, which operated a Lycoming O-
360-A1D engine.  A review of the airplane's logbook revealed a total airframe time of 5,419.0 
hours as of December 13, 2004.  The last annual inspection was dated August 14, 2004, at 
5,296.26 hours total time.  The engine, serial number L-5776-36, had a total time of 1,786.4 
hours since maintenance overhaul (SMOH) as of the last oil change on December 13, 2004.
The owner reported to the Safety Board investigator that the pilot had the attitude gyro 
overhauled.  An invoice from Global Tech documents that the attitude gyro was overhauled on 
April 15, 2005.  The attitude gyro, manufactured by RC Allen, is an electrically powered unit.  
There was no entry in the airframe logbook of the attitude gyro being removed and replaced 
but the owner said he thought the pilot had installed it himself.  The airplane owner also said 
that the pilot had mentioned to him that the overhauled attitude gyro was not performing 
correctly.  Numerous digital pictures of the instrument panel recovered from the pilot's 
camera, and provided to the Safety Board by the airplane's owner, show the airplane in level 
flight, and the attitude gyro indicates a 10-degree left angle of bank.  The file date on the digital 
pictures was May 19, 2005.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Radar
Examination of the radar data for the Van Nuys ILS RWY 16 approach shows that the airplane 
crossed the final approach course, 161 degrees, from the west between the initial approach fix 
(UMBER) and the outer marker.  The airplane's track overshoots the final approach course to 
the east and then corrects back so that it is on course at the outer marker.  The track then 
deviates to the east again and corrects back to the final approach course, which is then followed 
by a 90-degree turn away from the final approach course to the west.  The track proceeds 
westerly for 27 seconds climbing from 2,100 to 2,500 feet and then down to 2,400 feet.  The 
track turns south for 32 seconds climbing from 2,400 feet to 3,000 feet.  The last leg of the 
track proceeds northwesterly for the final 12 seconds and the altitude descends from 3,000 feet 
to 2,600 feet, to 2,400 feet, to the accident elevation at 1,253 feet.
The complete radar files and track plots are contained in the official docket of this 
investigation.
COMMUNICATIONS
The complete Air Traffic Control transcripts of communications with N6574U were provided 
by the FAA and are contained in the official docket of this investigation.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The wreckage was located on the south slope of a shallow ravine that ran roughly east-west; 
and the coordinates were 34 degrees 17.97 minutes north latitude and 118 degrees 31.814 
minutes west longitude, at an elevation of 1,253 feet above msl.  The ravine's hillside was 
sloped about 30 degrees, was covered in sagebrush and long grass, and the earth had a loose 
sandy like composition.  The wreckage was in a compact area that immediately surrounded the 
dimensions of the airplane.  The tail and wings were the only visible evidence of the airplane 
above ground level.  The wreckage was oriented on a bearing of 170 degrees magnetic and the 
Page 7 of 12LAX05FA193
tail protruded out of the ground about 90 degrees to the ravine slope.  The wings protruded 
outward against the ravine slope on each side of the tail.  The right wing flap had separated 
from the wing structure and laid a few feet behind the wing.  Both ailerons, both elevators, and 
the rudder were present on their respective flying surfaces.  The entire cockpit cabin and 
empennage was collapsed longitudinally into the hillside.  The wreckage was removed from the 
accident site and transported to Aircraft Recovery Services (ARS), Pearblossom, California, for 
further examination.  After extracting the wreckage from the hillside, it was observed that the 
engine had created a 4-foot-deep crater with the crater axis estimated to be 45 degrees to the 
horizon.  The earth beneath the right wing root produced a slight fuel like odor.  The earth 
beneath the left wing root produced a strong fuel like odor.
Technical representatives from Textron-Lycoming and the FAA examined the airplane 
wreckage on June 3rd, at ARS, under the supervision of the Safety Board investigator-in-
charge.
The engine firewall was completely deformed around the aft end of the engine.  The instrument 
panel was completely destroyed and collapsed into the firewall.  All the cockpit 
instrumentation had been displaced from their positions on the instrument panel and crushed 
into the firewall.  The throttle handle was observed extended about 1 inch and the handle rod 
bent.  The mixture and propeller controls were full forward and their handles bent.  The cable 
from the throttle was traced to the fractured ball off the carburetor throttle control arm, the 
mixture cable was traced to the fractured arm of the mixture lever, and the propeller condition 
cable was traced to the severed end of the propeller governor push rod.  The underside engine 
cowling and cockpit floor decking had deformed around the nose wheel structure.  The rudder 
control torque tube was present attached to cockpit floor decking; the attaching control rods all 
exhibited separations at the control rod ends consistent with overload forces.  The right-hand 
control yolk was present and connected to the control arm; the corresponding control 
push/pull rods were separated at their rod ends in a fashion consistent with overload forces.  
The pilot and copilot seats were attached to their respective seat tracks.  The artificial horizon 
attitude gyro was disassembled.  Rotational scoring was observed on the inner gyro housing 
and on the gyro itself.  The fuel selector was removed and observed to be selected to the left 
fuel tank.  Low-pressure air was passed through the valve and observed to exit the left fuel line 
port out of the valve.  No air was observed exiting the right port-orifice of the valve.
The left wing exhibited leading edge crushing along its full length.  The landing gear was in the 
retracted position.  The flap was separated from the trailing edge rails but was present in its 
full length.  The aileron was present on its hinges minus the outboard balance weight.  The 
upper wing aluminum skins pulled through the leading edge and wing rib rivet lines.  The 
lower wing surface had accordion like folds along its entire length.  The upper wing spar-cap 
fracture surface at the wing root exhibited a bright gray matte surface with 45-degree shear 
lips.  The aileron control tubes were traced continuously from the wing root to the aileron bell 
crank.  The aileron bell crank was present with the push rod separated at the rod ends.  
The aft fuselage, empennage, and tail exhibited severe compressive buckling back to the 
leading edges of the tail surfaces.  The vertical and horizontal stabilizers all exhibited leading 
edge crushing.  The elevator control balance weights were present at their appropriate location.  
The rudder balance weight was located in the wreckage area, separated from the rudder.  The 
control push rod for the rudder was attached to its bell crank and was buckled back from the 
aft fuselage bulkhead.  The elevator bell crank was present with push rod remnants in its 
Page 8 of 12LAX05FA193
fittings.  The elevator trim push rods were buckled and separated from the bell crank at the rod 
ends.
The right wing exhibited leading edge crushing along its entire length and the landing gear was 
in the retracted position.  The flap was separated from its rails but present in its full length.  
The upper wing spar-cap exhibited a bright matte gray fracture surface with 45-degree shear 
lips at the wing root location.  The upper wing skins were buckled outward and pulled through 
the leading edge and wing rib rivet lines.  The aileron was present on its hinges and the balance 
weight was located in the wreckage area.  The underside aluminum wing skins exhibited 
multiple buckle lines along the length of the wing in an accordion like fashion.  The aileron bell 
crank was present with the control rods separated at their rod ends.  The aileron control rods 
were traced continuously from the wing root area to the aileron bell crank.
The firewall structure was removed from the aft end of the engine.  The exhaust manifold 
exhibited ductile bending in many of the sections.  The magnetos were removed from the 
accessory drive.  The left magneto was turned by hand and produced spark on all four posts.  
The right magneto was turned by hand and produced spark on three of the four posts.  The 
spark plugs were observed to be grayish in color and corresponded to normal wear per the 
Champion Aviation Check-A-Plug chart, and exhibited no mechanical damage.  The valve 
covers were removed, and the valves and valve springs were observed intact.  The cylinder jugs 
and pistons were removed from the engine case.  The cylinder liners were smooth and all the 
pistons exhibited grayish slate like deposits on their faces.  The crankshaft was displaced aft 
about 1/2 inch.  The number 1 crank through had aft deflection of the forward cheek.  The oil 
pan had been fractured into many undistinguishable pieces.  The oil suction screen was 
recovered and observed to be clear of debris.  The carburetor was not present on the engine at 
the examination; only a section of the carburetor bowl was identified.  The vacuum pump drive 
coupling was intact and the rotor was fractured circumfrally at two locations.
The two propeller blades were observed separated from the hub at their bases.  Blade "A" 
exhibited leading edge polishing, chordwise scratches, and was bent aft about 10 degrees at 
midspan.  Blade "B" exhibited leading edge polishing, chordwise scratches, was bent forward at 
midspan about 30 degrees, and had a slight s-bend along the last 2 inches of the tip.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
The Los Angeles County Coroner completed the autopsy of the pilot on June 7, 2005.  The FAA 
Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed 
toxicological analysis from samples obtained during the autopsy.  The specimens were 
documented as putrefied by the laboratory.  The results of the analysis were positive for 
ethanol detected in muscle (>>56 mg/dL), ethanol detected in the liver (>>76 mg/dL), and n-
butanol detected in muscle (>>4 mg/dL).  The results for the tested drugs in the liver specimen 
were negative.
TESTS AND RESEARCH
Airplane Services at Orange County Airport
While the airplane was at Orange County Airport on June 1, 2005, Signature Flight Support 
provided fueling services to the airplane.  The pilot requested a top-off of 100LL, and at 1915, 
24.1 gallons of fuel was purchased.
Engine Data
Page 9 of 12LAX05FA193
This airplane had an EDM 800 cockpit displayed engine monitoring system manufactured by 
J.P. Instruments (JPI) that recorded engine data.  The EDM 800 instrument was recovered 
from the wreckage and engine data was extracted from the instrument at the JPI facility in 
Huntington Beach, California.  The data appeared uncorrupted and contained the data files for 
the last 8 flights.  The data fields obtained for each flight were; exhaust temperature out of each 
cylinder (F), cylinder head temperature (F), oil pressure (psi), DIF (difference between the 
hottest and coolest EGT), outside air temperature (F), carburetor temperature (F), battery volts 
(v), fuel flow (gph), engine rpm, manifold pressure (in/hg), and horsepower.  Engine data from 
all 8 flights were examined and no anomalies were noted.  The full flight and the last 10 
minutes of the last flight data file were examined in detail.  Plots containing the fuel flow, 
horsepower, engine rpm, and manifold pressure were generated.  The entire last flight data 
plot starts at 2118:30, and lasts for 1 hour 42 minutes, ending at 2300:06.  The engine rpm is 
recorded as being steady around 2,680 rpm for the 14 minutes prior to 2256:42, at which point 
the rpm drops to1,794 at 2257:54.  The engine rpm then increases to about 2,700 rpm by 
2259:06, and stays at that level until the end of the data set.  The lower rpm engine parameters 
are consistent with the reduced power profile required for a landing approach, and the higher 
rpm engine parameters are consistent with an engine at high power.  The data also illustrates 
the fuel flow, horsepower, and manifold pressure mirroring the engine rpm response curve.  
Data plots from the EDM 800 data download are contained in the official docket of this 
investigation.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Flight in to Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC)
The Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3A) states the following:
"A VFR pilot is in IMC conditions anytime he or she is unable to maintain airplane attitude 
control by reference to the natural horizon, regardless of the circumstances or the prevailing 
weather conditions.  Additionally, the VFR pilot is, in effect, in IMC anytime he or she is 
inadvertently, or intentionally for an indeterminate period of time, unable to navigate or 
establish geographical position by visual reference to landmarks on the surface.  These 
situations must be accepted by the pilot involved as a genuine emergency, requiring 
appropriate action.
The pilot must understand that unless he or she is trained, qualified, and current in the control 
of an airplane solely by reference to flight instruments, he or she will be unable to do so for any 
length of time.  Many hours of VFR flying using the attitude indicator as a reference for 
airplane control may lull a pilot into a false sense of security based on an overestimation of his 
or her personal ability to control the airplane solely by instrument reference.  In VFR 
conditions, even though the pilot thinks he or she is controlling the airplane by instrument 
reference, the pilot also receives an overview of the natural horizon and may subconsciously 
rely on it more than the cockpit attitude indicator.  If the natural horizon were to suddenly 
disappear, the untrained instrument pilot would be subject to vertigo, spatial disorientation, 
and inevitable control loss."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
