Registration:
N5606S
Aircraft:
Beech D-95A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Minor, 2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
During cruise flight, the pilot experienced a loss of engine power of one engine. Using standard 
engine out procedures , the pilot experienced difficulty identifying which engine had lost 
power.  However, without the knowledge of the pilot, the passenger attempted to assist the 
pilot in maintaining directional control after initial loss of engine power by applying right 
rudder. In an effort by the pilot to regain full engine power, the second engine lost power.  The 
pilot selected a nearby landfill for an emergency landing. During the emergency landing, the 
main landing gear collapsed. After the pilot and passenger exited the airplane, the passenger 
told the pilot that he had applied right rudder after the initial loss of engine power.   Post-
accident examination  of both engines failed to disclose any abnormalities and 35 gallons of 
fuel was recovered from the fuel system. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot mistakenly shut down the operating engine when the passenger interfered with the 
rudder pedals as he attempted to identify the inoperative engine.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
