Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot said that soon after departure from runway 33, he inadvertently entered a fog "bank."  
He said that he attempted a climbing right turn to return to the clear air over the departure 
runway.  He said that his airspeed dropped, and the aircraft stalled subsequently impacting 
trees and descended vertically to the mountain side.  The airplane came to rest inverted 
bending and wrinkling both wings and the fuselage.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadvertently flying into IMC weather conditions, his failure to maintain sufficient 
airspeed for flight, and his subsequent inadvertent stall/mush into trees.  Contributing factors 
were the fog and the trees.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
