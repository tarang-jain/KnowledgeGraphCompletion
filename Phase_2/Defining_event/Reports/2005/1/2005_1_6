Denver, CO
Incident Number:
DEN05IA046
Date & Time:
01/03/2005, 1934 MST 
Registration:
N202UX
Aircraft:
Beech 1900D
Aircraft Damage:
Minor
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor, 15 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 121: Air Carrier - Scheduled
Analysis 
According to witnesses, the tug was parked behind the left wing of the airplane, facing in the 
opposite direction, with its engine running. The airplane's engines were not running. When the 
tug operator "jumped" onto the tug, he lost his footing and slipped. As he grabbed for 
something to catch his balance, his right arm hit the tug's gearshift lever. As the tug started 
moving forward in a right turn, the tug operator's left foot became caught between the tug's 
frame and left rear tire. The tug circled around the left wing tip of the airplane and it struck the 
left engine nacelle. The tug operator's foot became wedged between the tug and the airplane's 
stairs, resulting in a sprained left ankle and a few minor lacerations. The airplane sustained 
minor damage to the left engine nacelle and one propeller blade. According to the FAA, the tug 
operator's training records did not reflect the tug operator's qualifications to operate ground 
equipment, including the gas powered Kubota tug involved in this incident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
the tug driver's failure to maintain operational control of the tug, resulting in impact with an 
airplane. Contributing factors include the tug driver's improper procedure, the tug driver's 
inadequate initial ground equipment training, and the company/operator's inadequate 
certification/approval of the tug driver.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
