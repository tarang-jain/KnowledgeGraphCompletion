Analysis 
The certificated airline transport pilot was returning to a maintenance vendor's hangar after 
completing a maintenance operational check flight.  He said that while taxiing on an ice 
covered parking area, he applied power to taxi up a small incline.  He said that as the airplane's 
skis went over the top of the incline, he closed the throttle, and reached for the mixture control 
cut off.  He noted that his sleeve caught on the throttle control, advancing it to the open 
position.  He said that he was unable to stop the airplane, and the left wing struck a parked 
maintenance tug. The left wing sustained substantial damage.  The pilot noted that there were 
no preaccident mechanical anomalies with the airplane. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's use of excessive taxispeed.  Factors associated with the accident were an icy taxi 
area, and the inadvertent activation of the throttle.

Factual Information
 On February 3, 1999, about 1030 Alaska standard time, a ski equipped Piper PA-18-150 
airplane, N7875D, sustained substantial damage while taxiing at Lake Hood, Anchorage, 
Alaska.  The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) local area flight when 
the accident occurred.  The airplane was operated by the U.S. Department of Interior, on a 
public use mission.  The solo airline transport pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed, and VFR company flight following procedures were in effect.  
In his written statement to the National Transportation Safety Board, the pilot reported that he 
was returning to a maintenance vendor's hangar after completing a maintenance operational 
check flight.  He said that while taxiing on an ice covered parking area, he applied power to taxi 
up a small incline.  He said that as the airplane's skis went over the top of the incline, he closed 
the throttle, and reached for the mixture control cut off.  He noted that his sleeve caught on the 
throttle control, advancing it to the open position.  He said that he was unable to stop the 
airplane, and the left wing struck a parked maintenance tug. 
The left wing sustained substantial damage.     
The pilot noted that there were no preaccident mechanical anomalies with the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
