Analysis 
The pilot said that he was landing on runway 11, and the wind was 010 degrees at 18 knots, 
gusting to 27 knots.  He said that he applied 'screeching' right brake to maintain directional 
control, and subsequently the right main landing gear assembly separated from the airplane.  
The airplane settled onto its right wing as the airplane turned left into the wind.  Postaccident 
examination of the wheel assembly, by the pilot, revealed that all four wheel assembly 
attachment bolts had sheared.

Factual Information
 On December 3, 1999, approximately 1440 mountain standard time, a Cessna 305A (L-19 
Birddog), N5245G, was substantially damaged during landing at Akron-Washington County 
Airport, Akron, Colorado.  The commercial pilot, the sole occupant on board, was not injured.  
The aircraft was being operated under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed for the cross-country flight which originated from Burlington, Colorado, 
approximately one hour before the accident.  No flight plan had been filed.
The pilot said that he was landing on runway 11, and the wind was 010 degrees at 18 knots, 
gusting to 27 knots.  He said that he applied "screeching" right brake to maintain directional 
control, and subsequently the right main wheel landing gear assembly separated from the 
airplane.  He said that the right "gear leg promptly went away," and the airplane settled onto its 
right wing as the airplane turned left into the wind.  Additionally, the right main landing gear 
box was damaged, the right outboard wing spar was bent, and the right aileron was damaged.
Postaccident examination of the wheel assembly, by the pilot, revealed that all four wheel 
assembly attachment bolts had sheared.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
