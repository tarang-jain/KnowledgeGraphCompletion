Factual Information
 On September 1, 1999, about 2030 Alaska daylight time, a tundra tire equipped Piper PA-18 
airplane, N9130D, sustained substantial damage when it contacted brush during the takeoff 
roll from a riverbank on Clear Creek, at 60 degrees 32 minutes north latitude, 144 degrees 46 
minutes west longitude, about 38 miles east of Cordova, Alaska.  The solo private pilot was not 
injured.  The flight was being conducted under 14 CFR Part 91 as a personal flight to spot 
moose.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight 
plan was filed.  
The pilot told the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC) during a telephone interview on 
September 13, and in his Pilot/Operator report, that during the takeoff roll, the left wing 
contacted brush located on the edge of the river, and the airplane spun around.  The right wing 
sustained substantial damage, and the right main landing gear collapsed.  He indicated the 
winds were light and variable.  The pilot said he had operated from the same area previously, 
but did not avoid striking willows during this takeoff.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
