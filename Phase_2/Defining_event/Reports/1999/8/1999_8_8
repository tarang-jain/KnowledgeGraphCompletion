Accident Number:
NYC99LA188
Date & Time:

Registration:
N2746C
Aircraft:
Cessna 172R
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot stated that while landing at his destination, the first approach to land on Runway 27 
was high, and a go-around was performed.  The second attempt to land on the runway was 
long, and the airplane floated about halfway down the runway, before touching down hard.  
The airplane then bounced into the air, and settled back to the ground, touching down hard a 
second time.  The airplane bounced several more times, until the pilot added full power, and 
executed a go-around.  The pilot climbed the airplane to about 3,000 feet above the ground, 
and returned to his departure airport.  The pilot did not notice any vibrations during the return 
flight, and the airplane performed normally, except for a slightly slower airspeed.  Examination 
of the airplane revealed damage to the main gear, the main cabin floorboards, buckling of the 
firewall, and 2-inch rearward curling of the propeller 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper flare and improper recovery from a bounced landing.

Factual Information
 On August 1, 1999, about 1110 Eastern Daylight Time, a Cessna 172R, N2746C, was 
substantially damaged while landing at the Delaware Airport (33N), Cheswold, Delaware.  The 
certificated private pilot and the passenger were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight that originated at the Brandywine 
Airport (N99), West Chester, Pennsylvania, conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
The pilot stated that while landing at 33N, the first approach to land on Runway 27, a 
3,715-foot long asphalt runway, was high, and a go-around was performed.  The second 
attempt to land on Runway 27 was long, and the airplane floated about halfway down the 
runway, before touching down hard.  The airplane then bounced into the air, and settled back 
to the ground, touching down hard a second time.  The airplane bounced several more times, 
until the pilot added full power, and executed a go-around.  The pilot climbed the airplane to 
about 3,000 feet above the ground, and returned to N99.  The pilot did not notice any 
vibrations during the return flight, and the airplane performed normally, except for a slightly 
slower airspeed. 
Examination of the airplane at N99 by a Federal Aviation Inspector revealed damage to 
the main gear, the main cabin floorboards, buckling of the firewall, and 2-inch rearward 
curling of the propeller blades. 
The winds reported at an airport located 5 miles to the southeast, at 1045 were, 300 
degrees at 8 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
