Location:
DURANGO, CO
Accident Number:
DEN99LA045
Date & Time:
03/01/1999, 1602 MST 
Registration:
N9823X
Aircraft:
Cessna 185
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot said the wind was 'steady at 14 mph, gusting to 24 mph,' between 240 and 260 
degrees, as he attempted to make a crosswind wheel landing on runway 20.  When the airplane 
touched down, the left wheel 'skidded' when left brake was applied.  The airplane ground 
looped and departed the right side of the runway, incurring substantial damage to the left wing.  
The airplane was FAA certificated under Type Certificate 3A24.  No maximum or demonstrated 
crosswind component is listed in the Pilot's Operating Handbook. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control and inadvertently allowing the airplane to 
ground loop.  Factors were gusty crosswind conditions, pertinent crosswind information not 
made available by the manufacturer, and FAA's inadequate certification and approval of the 
airplane.

Factual Information
 On March 1, 1999, at 1602 mountain standard time, Cessna 185, N9823X, was substantially 
damaged when it collided with terrain during landing roll at the Durango-La Plata County 
Airport, Durango, Colorado.  The private pilot, the sole occupant aboard, was not injured.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed for the personal 
flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  The flight originated at Durango 
approximately 1545.
According his accident report, the pilot said the wind was "steady at 14 mph, gusting to 24 
mph," between 240 and 260 degrees, as he attempted to make a crosswind wheel landing on 
runway 20.  When the airplane touched down, the left wheel "skidded" when left brake was 
applied.  The airplane ground looped and departed the right side of the runway, incurring 
substantial damage to the left wing.
N9823X, a 1961 Cessna 185, was certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration under 
Type Certificate 3A24.  No maximum or demonstrated crosswind component is listed in the 
Pilot's Operating Handbook.
According to FAA's Flight Standards District Office in Salt Lake City, Utah, this was the pilot's 
fourth accident and the third one in this particular airplane, to wit:

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
