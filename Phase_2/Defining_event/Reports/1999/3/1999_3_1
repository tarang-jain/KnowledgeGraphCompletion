Analysis 
As the airplane was turning base to final the pilot, 'felt a bump and vibration in the control 
stick...' when he commanded a final nose-up trim adjustment.  The pilot reported that the 
remainder of the approach to the runway was uneventful.  The pilot stated that, 'When I went 
to flare for the landing I did not have any pitch control.'  The pilot reported that the airplane 
landed very hard and bounced back into the air in a nose high orientation. The pilot reported 
that during the hard landing the seat broke from its mounts and fell onto the flaperon control 
tube, inhibiting flaperon actuation.  The pilot stated that the airplane then 'Stalled', landed tail 
first on the runway, ground looped, and came to rest with the right wingtip and the tail 
touching the ground.  Post accident examination of the aircraft showed that the trim actuator 
was fractured at its attachment point to the airframe. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

nose-up trim adjustment.  The pilot reported that the remainder of the approach to the runway 
was uneventful.  The pilot stated that, "When I went to flare for the landing I did not have any 
pitch control."  The pilot reported that the airplane landed very hard and bounced back into the 
air in a nose high orientation. The pilot reported that during the hard landing the seat broke 
from its mounts and fell onto the flaperon control tube, inhibiting flaperon actuation.  The pilot 
stated that the airplane then "Stalled", landed tail first on the runway, ground looped, and 
came to rest with the right wingtip and the tail touching the ground.
Post accident inspection of the aircraft showed that the trim actuator was fractured at its

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
