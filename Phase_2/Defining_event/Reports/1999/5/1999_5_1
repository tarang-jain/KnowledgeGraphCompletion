Location:
SENECA, SC
Accident Number:
ATL99LA079
Date & Time:
05/01/1999, 1715 EST 
Registration:
N50943
Aircraft:
Cessna 150J
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot established a final approach for a touch and go landing. The pilot landed with 40 
degrees of flaps, and during the takeoff phase of the touch and go procedure, he retracted the 
flaps to 10 degrees.  He continued the climbout and retracted the remanding flaps in 
increments.  As he retracted the flaps, the airplane lost altitude and collided with trees.  No 
mechanical problems with the airplane were reported by the pilot.  According to the pilot's 
handbook takeoff should not be accomplished with 30 or 40 degrees of flaps. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed which resulted in a stall and subsequent 
impact with trees. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH OBJECT
Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - INITIAL CLIMB
Findings
1. (C) OBJECT - TREE(S)
2. (C) AIRSPEED - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND
3. (C) STALL - INADVERTENT - PILOT IN COMMAND

Factual Information
 On May 1, 1999, about 1715 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 150J, N50943, collided with trees 
during climbout from a private airstrip near Seneca, South Carolina.  The flight was operated 
by the private pilot under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91 with no flight plan filed. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The private pilot and passenger 
received minor injuries and the airplane was substantially damaged. The flight departed 
Pickens County Airport in Pickens, South Carolina, at 1700, enroute to Clemson, South 
Carolina. 
After refueling at Pickens, the pilot and his son flew to a friend's private airstrip near, Seneca, 
South Carolina. After takeoff, the pilot flew directly to his friend's airstrip. Upon arriving at his 
friend's airstrip, they noticed that his friend's car was not there, so the pilot's son suggested 
they make a touch and go landing before returning home.  The pilot established a final 
approach for a normal landing with 40 degrees of wing flaps. After the touch down the pilot 
stated that he retracted the flaps, but noticed during the initial climb that the flaps had only 
retracted to 30 degrees. As he continued the climb the pilot retracted the flaps another ten 
degrees. Shortly after retracting the flaps to 20 degrees the airplane lost lift and altitude, and 
collided with trees on the departure end of the runway. 
No mechanical problems with the airplane were reported by the pilot. According to the Cessna 
150 pilot's handbook, "flap deflections of 30 and 40 degrees are not recommended at any time 
for takeoff". Ten degrees of flap may be used for short or soft field takeoffs. The pilot stated 
that " in the future, wherever possible, I intend to stay off grass runways"; the departure 
runway was grass.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
