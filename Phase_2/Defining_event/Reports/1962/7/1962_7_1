Factual Information
 On July 19, 1962, about 2345 hours Pacific daylight time, a Piper PA24-180, N5069P, collided 
with mountainous terrain about 22 miles southwest of Bridgeport, California.  The airplane 
was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country personal flight to Sacramento, 
California, when the accident occurred.  The airplane, operated by Capitol Skypark Inc., 
Sacramento, California, was destroyed by impact and postimpact fire.  The certificated 
commercial pilot and three passengers received fatal injuries.  A VFR flight plan was not filed.  
The flight originated from Fresno, California, about 2300 hours.
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operations inspector, Fresno Flight Standards 
District Office, reported that a U.S. Park Service trail crew from the Yosemite National Park 
discovered the airplane on August 8, 1994, in a remote section of the park about 9,200 feet 
mean sea level.  The location is in the Stubblefield Canyon drainage, north of the Pacific Crest 
hiking trail, below the Macomb Ridge.  The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board 
do not have any records of the accident flight.  The registration number of the airplane was 
retired and reassigned by the FAA to another aircraft in 1972.
A U.S. Park Service investigator reported that, during a coroner's investigation conducted 
jointly by the park service and Tuolumne County investigators, family members of the pilot and 
passengers provided details about the flight.  See attached park service report.
The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with an airplane single-engine land rating.  The 
pilot also held an aircraft mechanic certificate with airframe and powerplant ratings.  No 
record of the pilot's last medical certificate was retained by the FAA.  No personal flight records 
were located for the pilot.  No aircraft maintenance records for the airplane were located.
The recovered remains of the occupants were turned over to the Tuolumne County Coroner's 
Office, 28 N. Lower Sunset Dr., Sonora, California, by park ranger personnel.
The accident was located at latitude 38 degrees, 03.959 minutes north, and longitude 119 
degrees, 35.674 minutes west.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
