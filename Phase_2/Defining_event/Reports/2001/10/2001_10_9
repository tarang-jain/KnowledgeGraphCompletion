Registration:
N2528M
Aircraft:
Piper PA-12
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
While en route to refuel, the pilot experienced a loss of engine power and impacted trees 
during the ensuing forced landing.  The pilot said he departed when the airplane's fuel quantity 
gauges indicated that the right fuel tank was empty, and the left tank was "close to 1/2," which 
should have allow him to reach his destination; however, due to "heading winds" and the use of 
a "higher rpm," the airplane "ran out of fuel."  The airplane experienced a loss of engine power 
and impacted trees during the ensuing forced landing.  Examination of the airplane did not 
reveal any pre-impact mechanical malfunctions.  Both fuel tanks remained intact and there was 
no evidence of a fuel spill.  Approximately 1/2 gallon of fuel was observed in the airplane's fuel 
system.  Additionally, the fuel line which connected from the airframe fuel filter to the 
carburetor was removed and contained "a few drops" of fuel.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate preflight planning, which resulted in a loss of engine power due to fuel 
exhaustion.

Factual Information
On October 2, 2001, about 1400 eastern daylight time, a Piper PA-12, N2528M, was 
substantially damaged during a forced landing near Ashland, Maine.  The certificated 
commercial pilot sustained minor injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no 
flight plan had been filed for the flight destined for the Shin Pond Seaplane Base (85B), Patten, 
Maine.  The personal flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
In a written statement, the pilot said the airplane's fuel tanks were "topped off" on September 
29, 2001, at 85B, before a flight to "Fish River Lake, Moose Point Lodge."  The following day, 
the pilot flew to East Grand Lake, Orient, Maine, and then returned to Fish River Lake.  The 
morning of the accident, the pilot conducted a 1 hour local fight, and then departed Fish River 
Lake with the intention of refueling at 8B5.  The pilot stated that the airplane's fuel quantity 
gauges indicated that the right fuel tank was empty, and the left tank was "close to 1/2;" which 
should have allowed him to reach his destination; however, due to "heading winds" and the use 
of a "higher rpm," the airplane "ran out of fuel."  The airplane experienced a loss of engine 
power and impacted trees during the ensuing forced landing.  
Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector did not reveal any 
pre-impact mechanical malfunctions.  Both fuel tanks remained intact and there was no 
evidence of a fuel spill.  Approximately 1/2 gallon of fuel was observed in the airplane's fuel 
system.  Additionally, the fuel line which connected from the airframe fuel filter to the 
carburetor was removed and contained "a few drops" of fuel.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
