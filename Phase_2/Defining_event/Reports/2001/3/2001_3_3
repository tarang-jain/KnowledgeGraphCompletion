Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot stated to an FAA inspector that she landed on the first 1,000 feet of the 6,500 foot-
long runway.  After touchdown, she felt that something wasn't correct with the right main 
landing gear and intentionally lifted off from the runway.  She applied power to go around, 
then realized there was 4,000 feet of runway remaining.  She landed again, this time 
approximately 1/3 to 1/2 down the runway.  After touchdown, the airplane departed the left 
side of the runway onto grass collapsing both main landing gears.  A witness reported seeing 
the airplane on final approach to runway 03 when the airplane was about 30 feet above ground 
level.  The airplane was observed to land hard then bounced about the wingspan height above 
the ground.  Engine power was heard to be applied and the airplane was observed in a steep 
climb.  The witness did not observe the accident.  Postaccident examination of the airplane by 
an FAA inspector revealed damage to the firewall.  Wrinkles were noted in the left side of the 
fuselage aft of the firewall and also on the right side of the fuselage approximately 3 feet aft of 
the firewall.  There was no evidence of contact with the right main landing gear or of the right 
wingtip with the runway.  Coarse scratches were noted on the bottom of the left wing tip.  
According to the inspector, both main landing gears were down and locked when examined 
following recovery of the airplane.  According to the person who purchased the airplane, the 
engine mount was broken.  The gear box was intact and the retract mechanism was OK.  A 
record of conversation form is an attachment to this report.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the pilot to maintain directional control of the airplane after the second 
touchdown following a bounced landing resulting in collapse of all landing gears.

Factual Information
On March 1, 2001, about 1830 eastern standard time, a Temco GC-1B, N3301K, 
"registration pending", experienced collapse of both main landing gears while landing at the 
Sanford-Lee County Regional Airport, Sanford, North Carolina.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for the 14 CFR Part 91 personal 
flight.  The airplane was substantially damaged and the commercial-rated pilot, the sole 
occupant, was not injured.  The flight originated about 1615 from the Hummel Field Airport, 
Saluda, Virginia.
The pilot stated to an FAA inspector that she landed on the first 1,000 feet of the 6,500 
foot-long runway.  After touchdown, she felt that something wasn't correct with the right main 
landing gear and intentionally lifted off from the runway.  She applied power to go around, 
then realized there was 4,000 feet of runway remaining.  She landed again, this time 
approximately 1/3 to 1/2 down the runway.  After touchdown, the airplane departed the left 
side of the runway onto grass collapsing both main landing gears.
A witness reported seeing the airplane on final approach to runway 03 when the 
airplane was about 30 feet above ground level.  The airplane was observed to land hard then 
bounced about the wingspan height above the ground.  Engine power was heard to be applied

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
