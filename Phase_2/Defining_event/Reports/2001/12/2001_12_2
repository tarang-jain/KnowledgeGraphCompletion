Registration:
N5226
Aircraft:

Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The student pilot had completed three power recovery autorotations to the south, and the flight 
instructor was to demonstrate a "full touchdown autorotation" to end the training session.   
The flight instructor initiated the autorotation at 1,500 feet msl and 60 knots to the airport's 
mid-field median.  After slowing to 40 knots, the instructor began a flare to reduce the airspeed 
to 15-20 knots.  At 10 feet agl, he pulled collective to cushion the landing.  The helicopter 
touched down on the soft grassy area and slid for approximately 10 feet before starting to nose 
over.  "The tail of the helicopter pitched upward into the blades, severing it."  The helicopter 
rotated left approximately 270 degrees before coming to rest upright.  The flight instructor 
stated that "weather had saturated the ground and caused the sod to be soft on the usual 
landing area.  It was not visible from the helicopter."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the flight instructor's selection of an unsuitable area for practicing a full touchdown 
autorotation, which resulted in a nose over.   A contributing factor was the soft ground.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
