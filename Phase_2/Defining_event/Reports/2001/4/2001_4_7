Factual Information
On April 2, 2001, at 1740 eastern daylight  time, a Jacques J. Mistrot, Skybolt, N58JM,  an 
experimental airplane, collided with the ground shortly after liftoff from runway 03 at the 
Johnston County Airport in Smithfield, North Carolina.  The initial test flight was operated by 
the pilot for the owner under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91 with no flight plan filed. 
Visual weather conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The pilot was fatally injured, 
and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The test flight departed Smithfield, North 
Carolina, at 1739.  
Reportedly, this was the first flight of the experimental airplane.  According to the operator, the 
engine had been running continuously during 3 separate 45 minute taxi sessions.  During each 
check the engine ran smoothly  with an rpm varying from 800-2375.  The operator stated, 
"immediately prior to the first flight on the afternoon of April 2, 2001, the pilot and myself 
accomplished a complete preflight and walk-around inspection.  During the inspection all 
control surfaces were carefully examined for range and proper attachment.  The engine 
compartment, including oil and fuel quantities, were carefully checked." 
According to witnesses at the airport, the takeoff roll and initial climb appeared normal.  As the 
airplane continued the climb through 200 feet, it was observed entering a left  turn until the 
airplane developed a nose low attitude.  The airplane collided with trees on the right side of the 
runway.                
The pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate and was a certified flight instructor.  His 
total flight time was 25,000 hours, and the approximate flight time in the Skybolt 10 hours. 
The pilot held a current second-class medical certificate, dated December 8, 2000. The pilot 
had a prosthetic leg.
Examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or component 
failures.  The pilot did not report any mechanical malfunctions.  
Postmortem examination and the forensic toxicology of the pilot was performed by Dr. 
Chancellor  at the office of State Medical Examiner in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, on April 3, 
2001.   The toxicology examinations were negative for  alcohol.  Atropine and Lidocaine  were 
detected in the blood and liver.  These drugs are commonly used during resuscitation.  
According to the operator, there was attempted on site resuscitation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
