Location:
Boulder City, NV
Accident Number:
LAX01LA231
Date & Time:
07/01/2001, 0705 PDT 
Registration:
N737SH
Aircraft:
Cessna 172N
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
4 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane nosed over during a forced landing following a loss of engine power while in 
cruise flight.  The engine lost power 2 days prior to the accident due to an internal magneto 
timing problem.  The magneto timing was reset and the airplane was returned to service.  A 
post accident examination of the engine revealed the magneto contact points would not open.  
The magneto was retimed and found to operate normally.  According to the maintenance 
records, a 100-hour inspection took place 3.1 hours prior to the accident.  The earlier magneto 
maintenance adjustment took place at an unknown time between the 100-hour inspection and 
the accident flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the loss of engine power while in cruise flight due to the mechanic's improper magneto timing.

Factual Information
On July 1, 2001, at 0705 Pacific daylight time a Cessna 172N single engine airplane, N737SH, 
nosed over during a forced landing near Boulder City, Nevada.  The forced landing was 
precipitated by a loss of engine power during cruise flight.  The private pilot and three 
passengers were not injured, and the airplane sustained substantial damage.  The airplane was 
registered to a private individual and was operated by Westair Aviation, North Las Vegas, 
Nevada, under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91.  The personal flight departed Boulder City at 
0655, and was destined for North Las Vegas.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a 
flight plan was not filed.  
According to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector who responded to the accident 
site, during the pilot's preflight he had visually estimated 15 gallons of fuel in each tank prior to 
departure from North Las Vegas earlier that day.  A substantial amount of fuel was observed at 
the accident site.  The inspector also stated that the airplane had made a forced landing due to 
a loss of engine power at Jean, Nevada, on June 29, 2001.
The airplane sustained structural damage to it wings and empennage.  The Lycoming O-320-
H2AD engine (serial number L-5102-76T) had accumulated 302.2 total hours since its last 
overhaul.
The airplane was relocated to the facilities of Air Transport, Phoenix, Arizona, where on July 
24, 2001, an FAA inspector, along with an investigator from Textron Lycoming, examined the 
engine.  The engine remained attached to the airframe at the engine mount, and appeared 
relatively undamaged.  The top spark plugs were removed, examined, and compared to the 
Champion Check-A-Plug A-27 chart.  The spark plug electrodes were mechanically undamaged 
and exhibited coloration consistent with normal operation.  Thumb compression was 
confirmed in the proper firing order when the propeller was rotated manually.  The dual 
magneto was found secured to its mounting pad with the distributor cap and wires in place.  
Both "P" leads were secure in their respective ports.  A magneto synchronizer was attached at 
the magneto "P" leads to check the magneto to engine timing.  The magneto timing check 
indicated the left and right points were not opening.  The magneto distributor cap was removed 
to provide a visual examination of the contact assemblies.  During manual rotation of the 
propeller, the points were examined and found not to be opening as the magneto cam rotated.  
The magneto (part number D4RN-3000, serial number 1268803G) was removed from the 
engine and was taken to Homes Aviation, Chandler, Arizona, for further examination.  It was 
confirmed that the points would not open during cam rotation.  It was also placed on a test 
bench and no sparks were noted through the ignition harness.  The facility then reset the 
contacts and timing and retested the magneto.  The magneto was found operationally 
functional after the contact and timing work.  
A review of the maintenance records revealed the engine underwent its last 100-hour 
inspection on June 28, 2001, at an airplane total time of 7,270.5 hours, and 299.1 hours since 
the engine overhaul  The inspection occurred 3 operating hours prior to the accident.  On June 
30, 2001, a maintenance entry indicates the magneto internal timing was reset in accordance 
with the manufacturer's maintenance manual.  The airplane and engine total time was not 
indicated with this maintenance action.  At the time of the accident, the airplane had 
accumulated a total time of 7,273.6 hours.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
