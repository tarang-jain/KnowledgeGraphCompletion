Factual Information
On February 1, 2001, at 1934 hours mountain standard time, an amateur-built experimental 
Arthur Dragonfly, N29KK, lost engine power and made an emergency forced landing southeast 
of Marana, Arizona.  During the landing, the aircraft encountered rough terrain.  The airplane 
sustained substantial damage, and the certificated private pilot, the sole occupant, received 
only minor injuries.  The airplane was being operated by the pilot/owner as a personal flight 
under 14 CFR Part 91 when the accident occurred.  The local flight originated from the Marana 
Northwest Regional Airport about 1910.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time 
and no flight plan had been filed.
The pilot told Safety Board investigators that he had been in cruise flight at 4,000 feet mean 
sea level when the engine quit.  He said that he verified that the electric fuel pump switch was 
in the "on" position.  He then moved the fuel mixture control to the "full rich" position and 
engaged the starter.  After his unsuccessful attempts to start the engine, he made an emergency 
forced landing in open desert terrain.  During the forced landing, the forward canard was 
damaged.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
