Factual Information
On August 1, 2001, at 1131 central daylight time, a Beech A36, N136GR, piloted by a private 
pilot, was substantially damaged during a forced landing on a bean field near Sugar Grove, 
Illinois.  The pilot reported a total loss of engine power during climb from runway 18 (3,199 
feet by 75 feet, asphalt) at the Aurora Municipal Airport, Sugar Grove, Illinois.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The 14 CFR Part 91 
maintenance test flight was not operating on a flight plan.  The private pilot reported no 
injuries.  The local flight originated from the Aurora Municipal Airport, Aurora, Illinois at 1129.
The pilot/mechanic reported that the airplane had received an annual inspection. A ground 
test run was performed prior to the maintenance test flight with no fuel leaks noted.  He 
reported that during a postaccident inspection of the airplane, a fuel line loosened but did not 
come completely off the fitting.  He also stated that there was evidence of a small fire in the 
engine compartment area.
The pilot reported in a written statement, "Ground run up after annual [inspection] ok.  No 
leakage noted.  Run up before flight ok.  Full power attained at takeoff.  [Approximately] 500 
[feet] engine quit.  Changed fuel tanks [and] turned on fuel pump.  Engine restarted [and] quit 
after [approximately] 5 [seconds].  Put down landing gear and landed straight ahead in a bean 
field.  Beans collapsed nosegear [and] damaged wings [and] firewall.  No injuries.  Found main 
fuel line to flow divider had backed off about 3-4 turns.  Fuel stain evident."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
