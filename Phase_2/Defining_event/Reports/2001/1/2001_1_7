Analysis 
The student pilot lost directional control of the aircraft during a takeoff run while practicing 
solo touch-and-go landings.  The pilot stated that after a successful landing he initiated a 
takeoff and, "as I added power the airplane seemed to shimmy at which time I tried to correct 
the plane.  As I was unable to correct I powered back to idle and tried to stop which is when the 
plane went off the left side of the runway and hit a windrow of snow."  The pilot reported, 
"Hitting the snow made the planes [plane's] tail lift and spin around which made the right wing 
hit the ground causing damage."  The pilot stated that his total time in all aircraft was 24.1-
hours and all hours were flown in the accident airplane make and model.  The pilot reported 
that he had accumulated 1.4-hours of pilot-in-command time.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Aircraft directional control not being maintained by the student pilot during the takeoff roll.  
Factors to the accident were the snow bank and the student pilot's lack of total experience.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
