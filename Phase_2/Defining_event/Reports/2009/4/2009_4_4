Analysis   
The commercial pilot reported that he was landing on the frozen snow-covered lake in a ski-
equipped airplane. During the landing roll the airplane's main landing gear skis encountered a 
snowdrift, which stripped the nuts that connect the skis to the main landing gear axle. Both 
skis separated and the airplane's left main landing gear leg collapsed. The left wing struck the 
snow-covered frozen lake. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and 
fuselage. The pilot said that there were no preaccident mechanical problems with the airplane, 
and noted in his report to the NTSB that he should have inspected the landing site before 
landing, then selected a better area to land on.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
