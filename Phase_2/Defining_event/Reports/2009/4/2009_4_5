Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot aborted a previous takeoff because he was unable to maintain directional control of 
the airplane. He taxied the airplane to parking, inspected it visually, and elected to attempt 
another takeoff. During taxi, the control tower directed the pilot to complete a 180-degree turn. 
While turning, the pilot experienced a loss of brake pressure and directional control. He then 
applied asymmetrical engine power in an effort to complete the turn, but struck a fence post 
resulting in substantial damage to the left wing. Inspection of the airplane by the FAA revealed 
inoperative brakes on the airplane's right side.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to continue to operate the airplane with inoperative brakes on the 
airplane's right side.
Findings
Aircraft
Brake - Malfunction
Personnel issues

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
