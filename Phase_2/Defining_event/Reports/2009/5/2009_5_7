Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Addison, TX
Accident Number:
CEN09LA274
Date & Time:
05/03/2009, 2106 CDT 
Registration:
N528BM
Aircraft:
BEECH 35-C33
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion
Injuries:
2 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The two commercial pilots (one of which was the owner) flew to the accident location and 
dropped off a passenger. Prior to the first flight the owner pilot had checked the fuel levels and 
determined there was enough fuel to make their desired flights.  Neither pilot ensured the fuel 
selector was selecting the fullest tank prior to the second takeoff.  On departure and about 200 
feet above the ground the engine began sputtering and then lost power.  The pilots switched 
fuel tanks in-flight, but the engine did not restart.  The airplane landed short of the runway, 
resulting in substantial damage to the airplane and serious injuries to both pilots.  Examination 
of the airplane revealed the right main tank was empty and the fuel selector was selected to the 
left main tank.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power in flight due to fuel starvation as a result of the pilots' inadequate fuel 
management.
Findings
Aircraft
Fuel - Fluid management (Cause)
Personnel issues
Use of equip/system - Flight crew (Cause)

Factual Information
On May 3, 2009, about 2106 central daylight time, a Beech 35-C33 airplane, N528BM, was 
substantially damaged during a forced landing following a loss of engine power after takeoff 
from Addison Airport (ADS), Addison, Texas.  Both commercial pilots were seriously injured.  
The flight was being conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 91 without a flight plan.  The repositioning flight was originating from ADS, and was en-
route to Hicks Airfield (T67), Fort Worth, Texas.  Night, visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed at the time of the accident.
The pilot was flying in the left seat to build high performance pilot in command (PIC) time.  
His first flight in the airplane was the afternoon of the accident, when he and the airplane 
owner, who was also a commercial pilot, flew the owner™s son from T67 to ADS.  The pilot 
stated he was unfamiliar with the airplane.
The owner-pilot, who was in the right seat, stated he had checked the fuel before flying to ADS 
and determined each main tank had between 15 and 20 gallons of fuel and the fuel selector was 
on the right main tank.
The airplane was on departure from initial takeoff and about 200 feet above the ground when 
the engine started sputtering.  The owner-pilot immediately suspected the problem was that 
the fuel selector was still on the right main tank and it should have been switched to the left 
main tank. He reached for the fuel selector switch, which was located under the pilot™s left leg, 
but he could not reach it.  He then took control of the airplane and the pilot switched the fuel 
selector.  The pilot stated he could not recall which tank it was on.  The owner-pilot then 
attempted to return to ADS and land, but the airplane landed short of the runway on airport 
property.
The owner-pilot stated on the Accident/Incident Report (NTSB Form 6120.1) ﬁI believe we 
took-off on the [right main fuel tank] and ran it empty.  There [was not] time for the fuel in the 
[left main fuel tank] to restart the engine before we hit the ground. Other factors were that [the 
pilot] was unfamiliar with the airplane and I [was not] double checking him.ﬂ ﬁThe aircraft hit 
the ground before I could see [the ground].ﬂ
Examination of the airplane revealed the left main landing gear strut was sheared off and 
pushed up through the left wing. The left horizontal stabilizer was damaged and the fuselage 
was partially buckled.  Investigators on scene found the left wing tank was intact and contained 
approximately five to six gallons of fuel and the right wing tank was empty.  The fuel selector 
was found in the left tank position.
A post accident engine inspection revealed the fuel inlet line and fuel vapor line were both dry 
and did not contain any fuel.  Fuel was observed in the fuel manifold.  The inspection did not 
reveal any abnormalities that would have prevented normal operation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
