Analysis   
The commercial pilot was 500 feet above ground level on approach to his destination airport 
when the single-engine airplane lost power. The pilot made a forced landing to a rain-soaked 
field approximately 8 miles north of the runway. On touchdown the nose gear sank into the 
muddy terrain and collapsed. According to the pilot the airplane had approximately 15 gallons 
of fuel on board upon departure. An on-scene inspection of the fuel tanks indicated 2 1/2 
gallons in the left tank and 1 gallon in the right tank. The aircraft manual states 1 1/2 gallons of 
fuel is unusable in the tanks. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the firewall. The 
pilot and passenger were not injured.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion as a result of the pilot's failure to refuel the 
airplane prior to flight.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
