Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground

3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot was landing at a non-controlled airport where variable gusty winds were present. 
While on final, she encountered a right crosswind and then both updrafts and downdrafts as 
she crossed over a cliff under the flight path. The pilot said that while the touchdown was 
uneventful, as the airplane slowed during the landing roll it encountered a right crosswind gust 
and the right wing lifted. Although the pilot attempted remedial flight control inputs and added 
power, the left wing scrapped the runway surface and the airplane rotated to the left, exposing 
it to a nearly direct tailwind. As the pilot attempted to bring it back under control, the airplane 
nosed over onto its back. According to the pilot, there was no indication of any problem with 
the flight control or nosewheel steering systems. The pilot also stated that the winds from the 
north were unusual for this airport, and that she based her assumptions as to what would 
happen on the runway on the normal westerly or southeasterly winds.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the variable and unfavorable wind conditions.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
