Analysis   
The flight instructor said that he was giving an end-of-course stage check to the private 
licensed student, who was taking a commercial pilot course. The instructor said that the flight 
was normal and upon returning to the airport he requested to see a short-field landing. They 
landed in a nose-high attitude and there was "only a slight bumpﬂ when the aircraft™s main 
wheels touched down. Two more landings were performed by the student, which completed the 
stage check. Four hours later the flight instructor took the same student out for another lesson. 
The airplane had not been flown during this 4-hour period. During the airplane™s preflight 
examination, he found a large crack in the left wing's surface immediately above the landing 
gear attachment point. The flight instructor stated that the student did not make any hard 
landings during the first flight of the day. The student stated that she did not remember 
anything unusual about the flight.

Note:

to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=75181
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
