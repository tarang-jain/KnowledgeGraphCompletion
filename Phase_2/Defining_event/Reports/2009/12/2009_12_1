Analysis   
The student pilot reported that the airplane touched down smoothly on the main gear.  He 
reported that as the nose gear settled, the airplane began to drift to the right.  He stated that he 
applied left rudder, but it was ineffective as the airplane was on the nose and right main 
landing gears.  The airplane traveled off the right side of runway 25 onto the grass.  The pilot 
subsequently taxied the airplane back to the ramp.  Post accident inspection of the airplane 
revealed the firewall was dented.  Local winds were reported as being from 040 degrees at 3 
knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane while touching down during

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
