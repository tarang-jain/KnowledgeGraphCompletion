Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Carmi, IL
Accident Number:
CEN10CA067
Date & Time:
12/04/2009, 1040 CST 
Registration:
C-GZYU
Aircraft:
CESSNA 182
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel starvation
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that the airplane, which was equipped with long range fuel tanks, had been 
fully fueled five days prior to the flight. After 3.8 hours of flight time, the engine began to surge 
then lost power. After unsuccessful attempts at restarting the engine, the pilot made an off-
airport forced landing during which the airplane nosed over. Postaccident examination 
determined that the right fuel cap was missing, although the chain and spring clip were still in 
place. The pilot reported that the purpose of the flight was to act as a safety aircraft for 
Operation Migration. She stated that most of the flying involves making right-hand turns, 
which results in a higher fuel quantity in the right tank than in the left. The right fuel quantity 
indicator was indicating 3/8 to 1/2 tank of fuel and the left fuel tank was lower when the engine 
lost power. The pilot and pilot-rated passenger viewed the top of the wings twice after the 
airplane was fueled:  once to install the canopy cover and again to remove the canopy cover. 
The fuel cap was not checked for security nor was the fuel level visually checked after the 
airplane was fueled five days prior to the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total  loss of engine power due to fuel starvation as a result of the pilot's failure to assure that 
the fuel tank filler cap was secured prior to flight.
Findings
Aircraft
Fuel - Fluid management
Fuel storage - Inadequate inspection (Cause)
Personnel issues

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=75143
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
