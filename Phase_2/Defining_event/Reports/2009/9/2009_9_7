Analysis 
The 84-year-old pilot reported that the airplane did not seem to have enough power to become 
airborne during the takeoff. The airplane veered off the right side of the runway, where it came 
to rest after contacting trees and scrub brush. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the 
fuselage and wings. Neither the pilot nor the airplane had flown during the past 3 years. The 
pilot did not hold a current medical certificate. The pilot's wife reported that he suffered a fall 3 
years ago and that his physical and mental capabilities were such that he should not have been 
trying to fly the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the takeoff ground run. Contributing 
to the accident were the pilot's deteriorated physical and mental capabilities.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
