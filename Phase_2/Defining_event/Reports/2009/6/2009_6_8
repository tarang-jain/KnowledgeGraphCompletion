Analysis   
The student pilot entered downwind for the runway and performed a normal touch-and-go 
landing.  On the second landing, the airplane bounced and the right wing lifted quickly.  The 
student pilot applied right aileron and left rudder; the airplane landed back onto the runway on 
the right main landing gear and nosewheel.  The pilot still had full left rudder in on the second 
touchdown and the airplane suddenly veered to the left and exited the runway.  During the 
landing roll, the nosewheel dug into the soft ground and subsequently the airplane nosed over.  
The pilot stated that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
