Analysis   
The student pilot reported that his final approach to the runway was high and that he "slipped" 
the airplane to lose altitude. As the airplane crossed over the runway, he pitched the airplane 
forward to prepare for landing. The student pilot stated that he "felt the [air]plane losing 
forward momentum and added throttle to compensate." The airplane landed hard, bounced 
back into the air, and began to drift to the left. As the student pilot attempted to abort the 
landing by applying full throttle and reducing flaps, the airplane landed hard and exited the 
runway to the left. Subsequently, the airplane impacted a ditch, which resulted in structural 
damage to the rudder, left aileron, fuselage, and engine firewall. The student pilot reported no 
mechanical anomalies with the engine or airframe prior to the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
