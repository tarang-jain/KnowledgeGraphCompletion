Registration:
N70DD

BEECH 58
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Hard landing

2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Non-scheduled
Analysis   
The pilot diverted to a nearby airport after he encountered unforecasted freezing rain. He made 
two low passes over the airport while trying to clear ice off of the windshield; however, the 
windshield alcohol de-ice could not keep up with the ice accumulation. The pilot stated that he 
had to look out of the side window during the landing and once he descended below the tree 
line, he was unable to accurately judge his height over the runway. He stated that this was 
compounded by the light color of the new concrete runway which had snow blowing across it. A 
hard landing resulted after which the pilot taxied the airplane to the ramp. The right wing 
sustained substantial damage during the landing. The pilot stated that the de-ice systems on 
the airplane were working, but they could not keep up with the rate of ice accumulation
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper flare which resulted in a hard landing.  Contributing to the accident was 
the unforcasted freezing rain that obscured the windscreen and hindered the pilot's ability to 
judge the height of the airplane above the runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
