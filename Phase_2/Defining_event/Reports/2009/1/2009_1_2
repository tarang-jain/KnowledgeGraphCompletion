Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The student pilot was conducting his first solo flight and had performed two uneventful stop-
and-go landings. As the airplane accelerated during the third takeoff, it began to veer to the 
left. The student pilot applied right rudder; however, the airplane contacted a snow bank 
located off the left side of the runway and nosed over, substantially damaging the airplane. The 
student pilot stated that the winds were calm and the ailerons were in a neutral position during 
the takeoff. He did not report any mechanical failures or malfunctions of the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control during takeoff. Contributing to the 
accident was the student pilot's lack of solo flight experience and the snow bank located off the 
left side of the runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
