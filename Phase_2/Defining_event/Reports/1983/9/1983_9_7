Analysis 
THE CFI STATED THAT WHILE PRACTICING EMERGENCY LANDINGS, SMOKE 
STARTED BILLOWING INTO THE COCKPIT. SHE ALSO NOTICED A LOT OF HEAT NEAR 
HER LEGS. THINKING THAT THERE MIGHT BE A FIRE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
FIREWALL, THE CFI DECIDED TO LAND IN A CORN FIELD. THE CORN WAS 12 FT TALL 
& THE ACFT NOSED OVER ON ITS BACK. THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF SMOKE, HEAT OR 
FIRE WAS THAT THE WIRE LEAD FROM THE ELECTRICAL BUS BAR TO A RADIO WAS 
BURNED & MELTED AT THE END, AS WAS THE JUMPER WIRE BETWEEN THE BUS 
BARS. A SHOPOWNER AT THE ARPT STATED THAT THE JUMPER WIRE WAS 
UNDERSIZED & BECAME OVERLOADED CAUSING THE INSULATION TO BURN. THE 
CABIN HEATER VALVE WAS FOUND POSITIONED TO THE ON POSITION WHICH 
WOULD ALLOW ENGINE HEAT TO ENTER THE COCKPIT NEAR THE FLOOR LEVEL.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
