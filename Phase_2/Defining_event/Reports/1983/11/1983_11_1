Analysis 
DURING THE FLT, HYDRAULIC FAILURE OF THE LANDING SYS OCCURRED & THE 
AIRCREW WERE UNABLE TO GET THE GEAR LOCKED IN THE DOWN POSITION. AFTER 
ORBITING FOR OVER AN HOUR, A LANDING WAS MADE. DURING TOUCHDOWN, THE 
GEAR COLLAPSED. AN EXAM REVEALED THAT AN AILERON BALANCE CABLE HAD 
CHAFED AGAINST A HYDRAULIC LINE IN THE LANDING GEAR SYS UNTIL A HOLE WAS 
WORN THRU THE LINE. THIS ALLOWED THE HYDRAULIC FLUID TO LEAK OUT.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
