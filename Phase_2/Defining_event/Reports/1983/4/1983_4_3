Analysis 
THE ACFT WAS ON A FLT TO A PRIVATE RANCH LANDING STRIP AT NIGHT. THE STRIP 
HAD AN UNLIGHTED WINDSOCK AT MIDFIELD & PORTABLE RWY EDGE LIGHTS 
WERE IN USE. DURING ARRIVAL, THE AIRCREW ESTIMATED THE VISIBILITY WAS 3 
TO 4 MI & REPORTED THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO LAND. PERSONNEL AT THE RANCH 
HEARD THE ACFT FLY OVER. ONE OF THEM REPORTED THAT EARLIER, THE WIND 
HAD BEEN BLOWING HARD & THE AIR WAS FULL OF DUST, BUT AT THE TIME THE 
ACFT ARRIVED, DUST HAD SETTLED. A DEPUTY SHERIFF NOTED THAT AT TIMES, THE 
VISIBILITY WAS GOOD, BUT AT OTHER TIMES, IT WAS POOR. THE ACFT OWNER, WHO 
WAS AT THE RANCH, SAID HE COULD SEE THE ACFT LIGHTS AT TIMES (IN THE 
TRAFFIC PATTERN), BUT AT TIMES, HE COULD NOT SEE THEM. AFTER MAKING 2 
PASSES, THE ACFT CRASHED IN THE AREA WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON A BASE 
LEG. AN EXAM OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED IT WAS IN A LEFT TURN DURING 
IMPACT. AFTER INITIAL IMPACT, IT BOUNCED/SLID 663 FT, THEN HIT A TREE 
COVERED CANAL LEVEE & BURNED. NO EVIDENCE OF A PREIMPACT/MECHANICAL 
MALFUNCTION OR FAILURE WAS FOUND.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
