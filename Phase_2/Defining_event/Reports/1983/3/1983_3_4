Analysis 
DURING AN APPROACH TO AN OIL DRILLING RIG PLATFORM, THE ENGINE 
DECELERATED AS THE PILOT STARTED TO ALL POWER. WITH THE ACFT BELOW THE 
LANDING AREA, HE MANEUVERED TO MISS THE PLATFORM & INITIATED AN 
AUTOROTATIVE LANDING. HE MADE A MAYDAY CALL & TRIED TO ELECTRICALLY 
DEPLOY THE EMERGENCY FLOATS; HOWEVER, THE RIGHT FLOAT FAILED TO 
INFLATE & THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT TIME FOR MANUAL DEPLOYMENT. 
IMMEDIATELY ON TOUCHDOWN, THE HELICOPTER ROLLED OVER & BEGAN TO FILL 
WITH WATER. REPORTEDLY, THERE WAS ONLY MINOR DAMAGE FROM WATER 
IMMERSION. NO PREIMPACT DISCREPANCIES WERE FOUND THAT WOULD HAVE 
CAUSED THE POWER LOSS. THE WIRES TO THE RIGHT FLOAT (FOR ELECTRICAL 
DEPLOYMENT) WERE WORN IN TWO AT A CENTER HEX HEAD SCREW. A FLEET 
INSPECTION OF 37 ACFT REVEALED THAT 60% WERE WORN THRU IN THE SAME 
AREA.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
