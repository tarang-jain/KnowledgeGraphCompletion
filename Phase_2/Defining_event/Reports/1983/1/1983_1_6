Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE ENGINE LOST POWER WHEN THE PILOT WAS ON AN EXTENDED BASE LEG FOR 
LANDING. FROM THAT POSITION, HE COULD NOT GLIDE TO THE RUNWAY, SO HE 
ELECTED TO LAND ON A NEARBY BEACH. THE LOCATION OF PEOPLE WALKING ON 
THE BEACH PREVENTED AN UPWIND LANDING, SO THE PILOT TURNED TO LAND 
DOWNWIND. THIS REQUIRED A STEEP TURN AT LOW ALTITUDE TO AVOID LANDING 
IN THE OCEAN. THE PILOT STATED THAT THE UPPER WING MAY HAVE STALLED 
SOMEWHAT AS THERE WAS VIRTUALLY NO CONTROL FOR THE LAST 20 FT OF 
DESCENT. THE PLANE LANDED ON THE BEACH ON ALL THREE WHEELS, BUT THE 
NOSE AND RIGHT MAIN GEAR COLLAPSED. AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE 
CARBURETOR CHAMBERS AND FUEL FILTER BOWL CONTAINED WATER.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
