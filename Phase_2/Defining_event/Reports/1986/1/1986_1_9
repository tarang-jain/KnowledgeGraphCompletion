THE ACFT TOUCHED DOWN LONG ON THE 8500 FT RWY. THE FLT CREW RPRTD THAT 
'EVERYTHING SEEMED NORMAL DURING THE ROLLOUT UNTIL BELOW 80 KNOTS 
WHEN THE AIRCRAFT DID NOT SEEM TO SLOW.'  THE CREWMEMBERS WERE UNABLE 
TO STOP ON THE REMAINING RWY DESPITE THE USE OF BRAKES & REVERSE 
THRUST. INFO OBTAINED DURING THE INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT THE ACFT 
HAD TOUCHED DOWN WITH AN ESTIMATED 5037 FT OF RWY REMAINING.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
