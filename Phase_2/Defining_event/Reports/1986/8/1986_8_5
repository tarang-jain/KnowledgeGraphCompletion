Analysis 
THE PILOT EXPERIENCED A COMPLETE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM FAILURE THAT WAS 
CAUSED BY A BROKEN WIRE AT AN ALTERNATOR TERMINAL. UPON EXTENSION OF 
THE HYDRAULICALLY OPERATED LANDING GEAR A SAFE GEAR DOWN INDICATION 
WAS NOT OBTAINED. ACTIVATION OF THE CO2 OPERATED EMERGENCY GEAR 
EXTENSION SYSTEM FAILED TO PROVIDE A SAFE GEAR DOWN INDICATION. THE 
PILOT WAS UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH ANY FACILITY TO DETERMINE THE 
POSITION OF THE LANDING GEAR BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF ELECTRICAL POWER. 
HE ELECTED TO LAND ON THE GRASS ADJACENT TO THE RUNWAY. THE GEAR WAS 
DOWN AND UPON TOUCHDOWN, THE NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED WHEN IT DUG INTO 
THE SOFT TERRAIN. THE AIRCRAFT THEN FLIPPED INVERTED.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
