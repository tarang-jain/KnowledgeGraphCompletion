Analysis 
ACFT EXPERIENCED A POWER LOSS IMMEDIATELY AFTER TAKEOFF FROM AN 
OFFSHORE PLATFORM IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE PLT HELD COLLECTIVE TO 
CLEAR THE RIG AND THEN POPPED THE FLOATS AND AUTOROTATED TO THE 
WATER. THE AUTO WAS SUCCESSFUL, HOWEVER, THE ACFT WAS STRUCK BY A 5' 
WAVE AND ROLLED OVER. BOTH OCCUPANTS EGRESSED WITHOUT PROBLEM AND 
THE PAX SWAM TO THE RIG. THE PLT INFLATED HIS LIFE VEST AND WAS SWEPT 
AWAY BY THE CURRENT AND SWAM ASHORE 14 HOURS LATER. INVESTIGATION 
REVEALED THAT THE COMPRESSOR DISCHARGE PRESSURE (PC) LINE WAS 
DISCONNECTED FROM THE BACK OF THE ENG FUEL CONTROL. A LEAK OR 
SEPARATION OF THE PC LINE WOULD CAUSE THE FUEL SCHEDULE TO REDUCE ENG 
SPEED TO BELOW FLT IDLE. NO RECENT MAINTENANCE HAD BEEN PERFORMED ON 
THE FUEL CONTROL OR THE LINE.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
