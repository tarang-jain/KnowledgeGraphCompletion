Location:
Santa Paula, CA
Accident Number:
GAA18CA120
Date & Time:
02/02/2018, 1115 PST 
Registration:
N519AC
Aircraft:
AMERICAN CHAMPION AIRCRAFT 
7GCBC
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that, during landing, she became distracted by another airplane performing 
a touch-and-go, and upon touchdown, the airplane veered to the right. She added full power to 
go around, but the airplane continued to the right as it became airborne, and the right wing 
struck a parked helicopter. Subsequently, the airplane impacted the tops of bushes and came to 
rest inverted in an adjacent riverbed.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing due to being distracted by 
another airplane and her delayed initiation of a go-around, during which the right wing struck 
a parked helicopter.

Preventing Similar Accidents
Stay Centered: Preventing Loss of Control During Landing
Loss of control during landing is one of the leading causes of general aviation accidents and is 
often attributed to operational issues. Although most loss of control during landing accidents 
do not result in serious injuries, they typically require extensive airplane repairs and may 
involve potential damage to nearby objects such as fences, signs, and lighting.
Often, wind plays a role in these accidents. Landing in a crosswind presents challenges for 
pilots of all experience levels. Other wind conditions, such as gusting wind, tailwind, variable 
wind, or wind shifts, can also interfere with pilots™ abilities to land the airplane and maintain 
directional control.

What can pilots do?

Evaluate your mental and physical fitness before each flight using the Federal Aviation 
Administration™s (FAA) 
ﬁI'M SAFE Checklist."
 Being emotionally and physically ready 
will help you stay alert and potentially avoid common and preventable loss of control 
during landing accidents.

Check wind conditions and forecasts often. Take time during every approach briefing to 
fully understand the wind conditions. Use simple rules of thumb to help (for example, if 
the wind direction is 30 degrees off the runway heading, the crosswind component will 
be half of the total wind velocity).

Know your limitations and those of the airplane you are flying. Stay current and practice 
landings on different runways and during various wind conditions. If possible, practice 
with a flight instructor on board who can provide useful feedback and techniques for 
maintaining and improving your landing procedures.

Prepare early to perform a go around if the approach is not stabilized and does not go as 
planned or if you do not feel comfortable with the landing. Once you are airborne and 
stable again, you can decide to attempt to land again, reassess your landing runway, or 
land at an alternate airport. Incorporate go-around procedures into your recurrent 
training.

During landing, stay aligned with the centerline. Any misalignment reduces the time 
available to react if an unexpected event such as a wind gust or a tire blowout occurs.

Do not allow the airplane to touch down in a drift or in a crab. For airplanes with tricycle 
landing gear, do not allow the nosewheel to touch down first.

Maintain positive control of the airplane throughout the landing and be alert for 
directional control difficulties immediately upon and after touchdown. A loss of 
directional control can lead to a nose-over or ground loop, which can cause the airplane 
to tip or lean enough for the wing tip to contact the ground.

Stay mentally focused throughout the landing roll and taxi. During landing, avoid 
distractions, such as conversations with passengers or setting radio frequencies.

The FAA Safety Team (FAASTeam) provides access to online training courses, seminars, and 
webinars as part of the FAA™s ﬁWINGSŠPilot Proficiency Program.ﬂ This program includes

achieve flight proficiency and to assess and mitigate the risks associated with the most 
common causes of accidents, including loss of directional control. The courses listed below can

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=96712
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
