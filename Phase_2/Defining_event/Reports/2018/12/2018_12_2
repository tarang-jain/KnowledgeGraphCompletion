On December 2, 2018, about 1945 universal coordinated time, a Cessna 172P airplane, 
N98884, collided with vegetation following a runway excursion from an abandoned airstrip 
near Santa Rita, Guam. The commercial pilot and passenger sustained minor injuries and the 
airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane was registered to and operated by Trend 
Vector Aviation International Inc. as a Title 14

flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. The local flight 
originated from the Guam International Airport (GUM) at about 1830. 
The pilot reported that after a normal preflight and run-up, he took off to the south along the 
coastline. He spent some time in the practice area before proceeding to fly around a nearby 
harbor. While flying south along the shore, he initiated an eastbound climb when he observed 
the engine RPM steadily decrease to about 2,100 rpm, then 1,800 rpm, and finally to about 
400 rpm. The pilot attempted to restart the engine several times, but to no avail. He proceeded 
to a nearby abandoned runway and entered a tight base. After turning final he realized the 
airplane was too high and he attempted to slip the airplane, however, it subsequently landed 
long, exited the end of the runway and came to rest in heavy vegetation. 
The airplane has been recovered to a secure location for further examination.
