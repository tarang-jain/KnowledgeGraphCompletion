Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On August 1, 2018, about 1215 mountain daylight time, a Champion 7GCBC, N57477, veered off 
the runway and collided with a fence during the landing roll at the Big Creek Airport (U60), Big 
Creek, Idaho. The airline transport pilot and passenger were not injured. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage. The airplane was owned and operated by the pilot under the 
provisions of Title 14
 Code of Federal Regulation
 Part 91. The personal cross-country flight 
originated from Flying B Ranch, Salmon, Idaho at 1136 with a planned destination of Big 
Creek. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed.
The pilot stated that after making a normal landing on runway 19, he applied wheel brakes. The 
airplane immediately turned to the left, and despite application of brakes and right rudder, the 
airplane veered off the left side of the runway. The airplane continued over a water sprinkler 
system, through a wood fence and came to rest in a stand of pine trees. During the accident 
sequence, the airplane sustained damage to the right strut.
A witness stated that he observed the airplane make a normal landing remaining aligned with 
the runway centerline. He momentarily diverted his eyes and when he looked back, he noted 
the airplane was established in a gradual left turn, maneuvering at a slow speed in a 3-point 
attitude. The airplane then collided into an airport perimeter fence and came to rest about 600 
feet past the touchdown point.
