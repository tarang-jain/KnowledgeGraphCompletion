Flight Conducted Under:

The pilot reported that, while landing on a beach, as he "relaxed" the back pressure on the 
yoke, the airplane ground looped, the right wing struck the ground, and then the left wing 
struck the ground.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot added that after examining the tracks in the sand, it was obvious that he failed to hold 
back pressure on the yoke during the landing roll to maintain a proper soft-field technique.
