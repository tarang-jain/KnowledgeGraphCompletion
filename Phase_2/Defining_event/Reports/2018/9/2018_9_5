Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On September 1, 2018, about 1435 eastern daylight time, a Piper PA-12, N3415M, sustained 
substantial damage after a collision with terrain near Greenwood, Pennsylvania. The private 
pilot and two passengers were not injured. The airplane was owned and operated by the private 
pilot as a personal flight conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for 
the flight. The flight originated from Port Meadville Airport (GKJ), Meadville, Pennsylvania.
According to the pilot, he was flying for about 1 hour when the engine "quit." He attempted to 
return to GKJ but was unable to maintain altitude. He looked for a clearing, and as he 
approached an open field the airplane collided with a tree. The airplane then impacted terrain 
and came to rest inverted.
Initial examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed 
buckling throughout the airframe. In addition, crankshaft continuity was confirmed from the 
propeller hub to the accessory section of the engine. Thumb compression was obtained on all 
cylinders, and spark was generated on the magnetos.
The airplane was retained for further examination.
