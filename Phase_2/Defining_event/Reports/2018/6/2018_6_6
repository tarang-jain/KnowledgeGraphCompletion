Accident Number:
ANC18LA040
Date & Time:

Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On June 2, 2018, about 1025 Alaska daylight time, a Piper PA-18-150 airplane, N624MW, 
sustained substantial damage during a forced landing, following a total loss of engine power 
near Lawrence Airstrip (55AK), Wasilla, Alaska. The airplane was registered to and operated by 
the pilot as a 14 
Code of Federal Regulations
 (CFR) Part 91 visual flight rules flight when the 
accident occurred. The private pilot sustained serious injuries. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed. The flight departed 55AK about 1015 
destined for Big Lake, Alaska.
According to the pilot, shortly after departure from 55AK, all engine power was lost. He stated 
there were no sights or sounds consistent with a catastrophic engine failure and the engine 
ceased operation consistent with fuel starvation. The pilot reported the left fuel tank was about 
½ full, the right fuel tank was empty, and the fuel selector was on "BOTH.". 
During the forced landing, the pilot attempted to make the runway, but impacted a forested 
area of tall Spruce and Birch trees, resulting in substantial damage to the wings and rudder. 
A detailed engine and airframe examination is pending.
The aircraft was equipped with a Lycoming O-320 series engine.
