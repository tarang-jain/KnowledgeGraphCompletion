Analysis 
THE PLTS OF 2 ULTRALIGHT VEHICLES WERE ACCOMPANYING EACH OTHER & WERE 
FLYING WEST AT 500 FT AGL IN CALM AIR WHEN AN ACFT CROSSED AHEAD OF 
THEIR FLT PATH. THE ACFT WAS ESTIMATE TO BE FLYING AT ABOUT 140 KTS & APRX 
40 FT ABOVE THE ULTRALIGHTS' ALT. THE SURVIVING PLT STATED THAT HE 
CLIMBED TO CROSS ABOVE THE ACFT'S FLT PATH. HOWEVER, THE OTHER 
ULTRALIGHT, A PTERODACTYL ASCENDER II, CONTINUED STRAIGHT AHEAD & 
CROSSED ABOUT 10 SEC BEHIND THE ACFT. AFTER CROSSING THE ACFT'S FLT PATH, 
THE ASCENDER WAS SEEN TO SLOW DOWN & DRIFT TO THE RIGHT, THEN ENTER A 
SPIN & CRASH. REPORTEDLY, A PORTION OF THE RIGHT WING HAD FAILED BEFORE 
THE ULTRALIGHT CRASHED. NO PREEXISTING CRACKS WERE FOUND. ALL FACTURES 
WERE TYPICAL OF THOSE PRODUCED BY OVERSTRESS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
