Analysis 
THE PLT STATED THAT HE HAD BEEN PRACTICING LANDINGS AND THEN CLIMBED 
THE ACFT TO 5000 FT ABOVE THE ARPT. HE FLEW AROUND FOR AWHILE TO COOL 
OFF THE ENG AND THEN HE SHUTDOWN IT DOWN TO PRACTICE RESTARTS. AFTER 
THE FIRST RESTART THE ENG WAS SHUT DOWN A SECOND TIME. THIS RESTART WAS 
UNSUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THE PROP HAD STOPPED WINDMILLING AND THIS ACFT 
WAS NOT EQUIPPED WITH A STARTER. UPON REACHING 2500 FT MSL, THE PLT 
BEGAN CONCENTRATING ON THE FORCED LANDING. AFTER ONE CIRCLE OVER THE 
ARPT THE PLT DETERMINED HE WAS STILL TOO HIGH AND MADE A SECOND CIRCLE. 
DURING THE SECOND CIRCLE, THE WIND, WHICH WAS GUSTING TO 25 KTS, BLEW 
THE ACFT AWAY FROM THE RWY. THE ACFT COLLIDED WITH A SMALL TREE DURING 
THE FORCED LANDING.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
