Analysis 
DURING CRUISE FLIGHT AT 500 FT OVER GULF WATERS, THE LEFT ENGINE 
SUSTAINED A MASSIVE, UNCONTAINED, EXPLOSIVE FAILURE. SHARPNEL 
PENETRATED THE RIGHT ENGINE, WHICH FAILED FROM DAMAGE. SHARPNEL ALSO 
PENETRATED THE AC AND DC JUNCTION BOXES, CAUSING COMPLETE ELECTRICAL 
FAILURE (NO MAYDAY CALL POSSIBLE). SHARPNEL FURTHER SEVERED THE TAIL 
ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT AND PENETRATED THE ACFT FUEL SYSTEM; FIRE BROKE OUT 
IN THE TRANSMISSION AREA AND THE COCKPIT FILLED WITH SMOKE. USING THE 
CO-PLT'S SIDE WINDOW FOR VISUAL ACQUISITION OF THE WATER SURFACE, A 
SUCCESSFUL AUTOROTATION WAS PERFORMED. HOWEVER, THE ACFT ROLLED 
OVER AND SANK SINCE THE EMERGENCY FLOATATION GEAR IS ELECTRICALLY 
OPERATED AND FAILED TO DEPLOY. AFTER SUCCESSFUL EVACUATION BY ALL 
OCCUPANTS, PLT RETURNED TO THE INVERTED ACFT AND DEPLOYED LIFE RAFTS. 
INVESTIGATION REVEALED LEFT ENGINE COMPRESSOR-TO-TURBINE COUPLING 
HAD FAILED IN FATIGUE. TURBINE WENT OVERSPEED AND BURST UNDER 
CENTRIFUGAL LOADS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
