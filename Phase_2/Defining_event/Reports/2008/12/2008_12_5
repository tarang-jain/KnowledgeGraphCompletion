Aircraft:
CESSNA A185F
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The tailwheel-equipped airplane was landing with a left crosswind. While rolling out, the 
airplane veered to the right and the pilot attempted to correct with aileron, rudder, and then 
brake. The pilot stated that when left braking was applied, the airplane nosed forward and the 
left wingtip and propeller contacted the ground. He stated that the airplane then nosed over. 
The pilot reported no mechanical malfunction of the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to compensate for the crosswind during landing, resulting in loss of control 
of the aircraft and the subsequent nose-over of the airplane. Contributing to the accident was 
the crosswind.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
