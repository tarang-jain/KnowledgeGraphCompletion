Analysis   
The pilot reported that the airplane was on short final approach for landing on runway 35, 
when he experienced a "sudden loss of airspeed and rapid increase in descent rate that was not 
altered by the application of power." The airplane landed hard on the runway, all three landing 
gear collapsed, and the airplane slid off the left side of the runway. The wing spar and engine 
firewall were substantially damaged. The pilot further stated that he was flying from the right 
seat, which made referencing the instruments more difficult, and he "encountered windshear." 
The winds at an airport located 10 miles northeast of the accident airport, about the time of the 
accident, were recorded as 280 degrees at 17 knots, with gusts to 34 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control while landing in gusty conditions.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
