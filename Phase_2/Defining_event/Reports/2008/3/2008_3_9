Analysis   
In a written statement provided to the NTSB, the pilot reported that the airplane was in cruise 
flight at approximately 3,000 feet above ground level when the oil pressure gauge began to 
fluctuate.  The pilot observed that the oil temperature and cylinder head temperature readings 
remained within the normal range.  Additionally, the pilot stated that the engine "shuddered" 
several times before he experienced a total loss of engine power.  Due to altitude and airspeed, 
the pilot reported that the only landing area available was a "soft, sandy, field."  During the 
landing roll out the left main gear and nose gear dug into the soft terrain resulting in the 
collapse of the left main and nose landing gear.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to 
the left wing.  The pilot, sole occupant of the airplane, was able to egress without assistance.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Loss of engine power for undetermined reasons. A factor was the soft terrain.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
