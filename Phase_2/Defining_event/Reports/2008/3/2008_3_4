Analysis   
Upon arrival at the destination airport, the pilot noted that the windsock appeared to favor 
runway 19.  The pilot reported that the approach was made with the airplane configured in a 
slip to compensate for a crosswind.  As the airplane touched down, there was a slight bounce.  
During the landing rollout, the airplane began to veer to the right.  The pilot applied left rudder 
to correct the heading; however, the airplane continued off the runway and hit a culvert with a 
rock facing.  The left main landing gear was sheared off and the airplane came to rest inverted 
causing structural damage to the wings, the vertical stabilizer, and rudder.  According to the 
pilot's written statement, she received weather information via the National Weather Service 
and an automated report.  The winds were reported to be from 280 degrees at 4 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the crosswind condition and failure to maintain 
directional control.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
