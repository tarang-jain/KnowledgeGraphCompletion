Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The private pilot used differential power to help land his twin engine, tailwheel-equipped 
airplane on a paved runway with a left crosswind.  During the landing roll out, when the 
tailwheel touched down on the ground, the airplane turned into the wind and departed the 
runway to the left.  It crossed over a ditch and struck a metal fence.   The airplane sustained 
structural damage to the left engine mount.  The left wing tip, left landing gear drag link, right 
vertical stabilizer and the rudder were also damaged.  The pilot stated that the accident could 
have been prevented if he had kept the tail in the air longer with more differential power 
carried into the landing roll out.  He reported that the wind was from 100 degrees at 15 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing roll out.  Contributing to the 
accident was the crosswind.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
