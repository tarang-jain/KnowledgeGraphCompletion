Analysis   
The pilot stated that prior to landing he believed that he had a quartering head wind between 6 
and 8 knots. Once over runway 14 at 10 feet agl, "suddenly the wind shifted and we were lifted 
up and keeled over to the right. Once I leveled the wings I realized that we were quickly 
running out of runway." The pilot stated that he attempted a go-around; he put in full power 
and raised the flaps to 20 degrees. However, he did not have enough power or clearance to stay 
out of the trees. The pilot banked left to avoid the trees and "dropped" the airplane in a field 
between houses. The airplane hit the ground and then skidded to a stop into a tree. The 
reported weather conditions at Brunswick, Maine, at the time of the accident was visual 
meteorological conditions with winds at 340 degrees at 19 knots gusting to 27 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
