Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
During the departure roll, as the airplane became airborne, the left main landing gear collided 
with a large rock on the left side of the pilot's private airstrip. From the cockpit the pilot 
visually confirmed that the damage seemed to be confined to the left wheel fairing, which was 
torn off, but could not discern any other damage. The airplane operated normally and the pilot 
landed without further incident. After landing, the pilot noted that the left tire was flat and the 
left main landing gear strut was damaged, including the gear box. The pilot stated that accident 
could have been prevented if he had ensured there were no rocks on the airstrip, and if he had 
maintained runway centerline. The pilot added that there were no preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures with the airframe or engine.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain proper runway alignment and clearance from a large rock on the 
side of the runway.  Contributing to the accident was the failure of the pilot to maintain the 
runway environment of his private strip clear of obstructions.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
