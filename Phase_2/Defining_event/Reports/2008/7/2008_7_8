Analysis   
The pilot performed a normal cold-inflation of the balloon and instructed the passengers to 
board. The balloon was suddenly overcome by a gust of wind that pushed the envelope into a 
tree. The balloon was drawn upward by the wind, with its vent lines still entangled in the tree. 
As the lines became taut, sections of material ripped from the envelope, resulting in several 
long vertical tears. The pilot elected to abort the flight due to increasing wind speeds. The pilot 
attempted to gain control and stabilize the balloon, but it descended and collided with a tree. 
The basket came to rest about 20 feet above terrain. The pilot stated that there were no 
preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the balloon.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
An encounter with a sudden gust of wind, which rendered the balloon uncontrollable and led to 
a collision with a tree.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
