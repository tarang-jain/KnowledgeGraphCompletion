Accident Number:
SEA08LA070
Date & Time:
02/02/2008, 1000 PST 
Registration:
N96KR
Aircraft:
KIDD CHRIS HARMON ROC
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Collision with terr/obj (non-CFIT)
Injuries:
1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot departed a location where visual meteorological conditions existed, and was 
attempting to fly to another location that was also reporting visual meteorological conditions. 
During the flight, the pilot entered an area of hilly terrain that was covered by a low overcast 
ceiling of variable height. While maneuvering through that area in winds that were reportedly 
gusting to 10 miles per hour, the airplane impacted the terrain. No evidence was found of any 
anomaly or malfunction of the airframe, flight controls, or engine.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain an adequate terrain clearance altitude while maneuvering in 
mountainous, hilly terrain.  Contributing to the accident were hilly terrain, a low ceiling and 
gusty winds.

Factual Information
On February 2, 2008, about 1000 Pacific standard time, an experimental Kidd Harmon 
Rocket, N96KR, impacted the hilly terrain about 10 miles south of Maricopa, California. The 
private pilot, who was the sole occupant of the airplane, was killed, and the airplane, which was 
owned and operated by the pilot, was destroyed. The pilot of the 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) part 91 personal pleasure flight departed a private airstrip near Taft, 
California, around 0930. According to a family member, he was en route to the area around 
New Cuyama, California. No flight plan had been filed. There was no report of an ELT 
activation.
At the time the pilot departed Taft, there were visual meteorological conditions (VMC), with 10 
miles visibly, in both Taft and New Cuyama. But witnesses who lived in the area reported that 
there were low ceilings of variable heights and winds gusting to about 10 miles per hour in the 
hills between the two locations. Reportedly, although the visibility below the clouds was good, 
the ceiling was touching the top of the hills in many places throughout the area. 
It is believed that the pilot attempted to follow State Highway 33 through the narrow valley 
that runs northeast to southwest through the aforementioned hills. While the pilot was 
maneuvering in that area, the airplane impacted the terrain while traveling in a northwesterly 
direction. According to the FAA Inspector who responded to the scene, the airplane hit "very 
hard" in a nose-down attitude, and traveled about 150 feet before coming to rest. The impact 
created a three-foot-deep crater, and tore the engine from the airframe.
When the pilot did not show up at his destination on the day of his departure, his family 
reported him missing, and a search was initiated. The wreckage was eventually spotted from 
the air four days after the accident.
The airplane was relocated to the facilities of Aircraft Recovery Services, where it underwent an 
FAA directed teardown inspection. That inspection did not reveal any evidence of a pre-impact 
anomaly or malfunction of the airframe, flight controls, or engine components.
The FAA's Forensic Toxicology Research Team performed a toxicological examination on 
specimens taken from the pilot. That examination was negative for screened drugs and 
consumed ethanol. Due to the elapsed time between the accident and the discovery of the 
wreckage, the standard  tests for carbon monoxide and cyanide were not performed.
The Kern County Coroner performed an autopsy on the pilot, and the cause of death was 
determined to be from blunt force injuries, with the manner of death being listed as accidental.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
