Substantial

Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that during the night flight, and prior to landing, he discovered that both 
landing lights were burned out.  During the landing, the nose of the right skid contacted the 
ground and the helicopter bounced back into the air and rotated to the right resulting in the tail 
rotor striking a hangar.  The helicopter rotated about 360 degrees before impacting the ground.  
The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the tail rotor gearbox attachment point.  The 
pilot reported no other abnormalities with the helicopter prior to the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's misjudged landing flare, inadequate bounced landing recovery, and failure to 
maintain directional control during a bounced landing that resulted in the tail rotor blades 
colliding with a hangar. Contributing to the accident was the burned out landing lights.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
