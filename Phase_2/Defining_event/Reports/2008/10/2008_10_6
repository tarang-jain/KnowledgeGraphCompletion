Factual Information
On October 2, 2008, about 1535 Alaska daylight time, a tundra tire-equipped Piper PA-18 
airplane, N788, sustained substantial damage when it nosed over during landing on a remote 
gravel bar, about 28 miles northwest of Anchorage, Alaska. The airplane was being operated as 
a visual flight rules (VFR) local area flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the accident 
occurred. The airplane was operated by the U.S. Department of Interior, Anchorage, Alaska. 
The commercial certificated pilot, seated in the rear seat, and the airline transport pilot seated 
in the front seat, both certificated flight instructors, were not injured. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed, and a VFR flight plan was filed. The flight originated at the Lake Hood 
Airstrip, Anchorage, Alaska, about 1300.
During an interview with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-
charge (IIC), on October 6, 2008, an investigator with the Department of Interior reported that 
the airplane was being operated for pilot proficiency, and to scout landing areas for an off-
airport landing clinic. Each of the two pilots aboard planned to fly from the rear seat of the 
airplane during the clinic, and the rear seat pilot had been designated as the pilot-in-command 
for the accident flight. The rear seat pilot selected a gravel bar along the Susitna River that was 
about 2,000 feet long.  During the landing roll, he applied excessive braking, and the airplane 
nosed over.  The airplane received structural damage to the right wing lift strut and the left 
wing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
