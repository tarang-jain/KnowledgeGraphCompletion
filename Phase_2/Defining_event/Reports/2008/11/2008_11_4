Analysis   
The solo student pilot of the Grumman AA5B stated he was maneuvering in his local training 
area when he experienced symptoms of "vertigo." The pilot was on a westerly heading in the 
late afternoon, looking through the propeller, at the onset of the symptoms. He managed to 
navigate back to his home airport, but during the landing, lost directional control, departed the 
runway, and collided with an airport sign. The pilot was not injured, but examination of his 
medical records revealed he was treated by a physician for symptoms of vertigo in the days 
following the accident. According to the Federal Aviation Administration Airplane Flying 
Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3A), flicker vertigo is defined as: "A disorienting condition caused 
from flickering light off the blades of the propeller."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of directional control during landing and while suffering symptoms of vertigo.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
