Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Anchorage, AK
Accident Number:
ANC08LA094
Date & Time:
08/01/2008, 1630 AKD 
Registration:
N2357U
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was landing on runway 25, and indicated that just as the main landing gear tires 
touched down, the airplane was struck by a strong wind from the right. The pilot attempted to 
correct for the wind, and added engine power, but the airplane departed the left side of the 
runway. The nose gear collapsed when it encountered soft terrain along the side of the runway, 
which spun the airplane around about 180 degrees. The wind conditions were reported as 280 
degrees (true) at 11 knots. In the "Recommendation" (How could this accident have been 
prevented) section of the Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB Form 6120.1) 
submitted by the pilot, the pilot noted he could have utilized "Better use of aileron and rudder 
for directional control."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing flare/touchdown, which 
resulted in a runway excursion and collapse of the nose gear.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Nose/tail landing gear - Capability exceeded
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Wind - Response/compensation

Factual Information
On August 1, 2008, about 1630 Alaska daylight time, a Cessna 172 airplane, N2357U, sustained 
substantial damage when it departed the runway during the landing flare/touchdown at Merrill 
Field, Anchorage, Alaska. The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-
country personal flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred. The airplane 
was operated by the pilot. The commercial certificated pilot, and the sole passenger, were not 
injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a VFR flight plan was filed. The flight 
originated at the Homer Airport, Homer, Alaska, about 1430.
During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
investigator-in-charge (IIC), on August 5, the pilot reported that he was landing on runway 25 
at Merrill Field. During the landing flare, just as the main landing gear tires touched down, the 
airplane was struck by a strong wind from the right. The pilot attempted to correct for the 
wind, and added engine power, but the airplane departed the left side of the runway. The nose 
gear collapsed when it encountered soft terrain along the side of the runway, which spun the 
airplane around about 180 degrees.
At 1634, an aviation routine weather report (METAR) at Merrill Field was reporting, in part:  
Wind, 280 degrees (true) at 11 knots; visibility, 10 statute miles; clouds and sky condition, 
5,000 feet broken; temperature, 61 degrees F; dew point, 52 degrees F; altimeter, 28.89 inHg.
In the "Recommendation" (How could this accident have been prevented) section of the 
Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB Form 6120.1) submitted by the pilot, the pilot 
noted he could have utilized "Better use of aileron and rudder for directional control."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
