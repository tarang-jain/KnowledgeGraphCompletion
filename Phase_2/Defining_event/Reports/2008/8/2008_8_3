Analysis   
The pilot reported that during the landing he let the "nose come down and used brakes which 
caused the low clearance gear leg to dig in and begin bending."  The airplane's propeller and 
wing subsequently contacted the "undulating" grass strip.  The pilot reported no mechanical 
malfunctions with the airplane during the accident flight.  The pilot's safety recommendation 
was to replace the accident gear leg with the "new revision ... from Vans [aircraft] which has 
greater ground clearance."

The pilot's inadequate flare during landing.  Contributing to the accident was the uneven

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
