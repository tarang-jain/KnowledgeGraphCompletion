Analysis   
According to the operator's director of operations, maintenance personnel discovered damage 
to the twin-engine turboprop airplane during a routine, daily inspection.  A review of the 
airplane flight logs revealed that the airplane's damage most likely occurred as the result of a 
hard landing event during the last flight, earlier that day. The airplane sustained structural 
damage to the wings and fuselage.  Neither of the two pilots reported any preaccident 
mechanical problems with the airplane, nor did they report any hard landing event.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flightcrew's misjudged flare while landing. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: HARD LANDING

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
