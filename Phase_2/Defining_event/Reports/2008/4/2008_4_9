Analysis   
The pilot was landing the tailwheel equipped airplane in a crosswind on runway 20 and 
reported that during the landing roll, "...a sudden gust from the west lifted the right wing and 
landing gear." As the pilot attempted to correct the situation, the airplane's left main landing 
gear strut collapsed, and the left wing struck the runway surface. The airplane received 
structural damage to left wing and fuselage. The wind at the time of the accident was from 110 
degrees at 10 knots. No mechanical malfunctions were reported.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions during landing.  A gusting crosswind 
was a contributing factor.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
