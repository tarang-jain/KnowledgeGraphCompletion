Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The amateur-built airplane was substantially damaged during a forced landing during landing 
approach. The pilot reported that as he circled the airport, the engine speed went to 6,000 
RPM.  He stated that he pulled the power back, lowered the landing gear and increased the 
propeller pitch.  He said that the airplane began to stall and he could not maintain altitude. He 
executed a forced landing to a wetland.  The right wing struck the water and broke off spinning 
the airplane around. Subsequent examination of the controllable pitch propeller revealed that a 
jack screw pin had sheared allowing the prop to go to a fine pitch setting.  One of the blade 
pitch stops also broke resulting in the blade moving into a reverse pitch position.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the propeller pitch control mechanism during approach.  Contributing to the 
accident were the inability of the pilot to maintain airspeed and altitude, and the unsuitable 
terrain.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
