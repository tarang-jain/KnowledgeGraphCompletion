Analysis 
 AFTER TAKEOFF FOLLOWING THE THIRD TOUCH & GO LANDING ON RWY 36, 
DURING THE DOWNWIND LEG WHERE THE FLT WAS ABOUT 1 MILE WEST OF THE 
DEPARTURE RWY, THE STUDENT ADVISED THE CFI THAT HE SMELLED SOMETHING 
BURNING & THAT THE ENG WASN'T PRODUCING POWER.  THE CFI ADVANCED & 
RETARDED THE THROTTLE & OBSERVED THAT THE MANIFOLD PRESSURE NEEDLE 
MOVEMENT FOLLOWED THE THROTTLE MOVEMENT, THEN GAVE CONTROL OF THE 
ACFT BACK TO THE STUDENT.  THE STUDENT AGAIN STATED THAT THE ENG WASN'T 
PRODUCING POWER & THE CFI TOOK CONTROL, TURNED TO THE EAST TO LAND ON 
A TAXIWAY, & LANDED HARD SHORT OF THE TAXIWAY. FUEL QUANTITY WAS 
SUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN ENG OPERATION & THE FUEL SUPPLY DID NOT CONTAIN 
CONTAMINANTS. THE ENG WAS STARTED AFTER THE ACCIDENT & OPERATED ONLY 
TO 1,500 RPM DUE TO DAMAGE TO THE PROPELLER ASSY. THE ENG WAS THEN SENT 
TO THE MANUFACTURER'S FACILITY OPERATED WITH THE ONLY DISCREPANCY 
NOTED THAT THE FUEL FLOW AT 80 PPH WAS 9 PPH LEANER THAN SPECIFICATION. 
NO DETERMINATION COULD BE MADE AS TO THE REASON FOR THE LOSS OF ENG 
POWER.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
