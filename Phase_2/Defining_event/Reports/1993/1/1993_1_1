Analysis 
 THE STUDENT PILOT HAD PLANNED A SOLO CROSS COUNTRY IN PREPARATION FOR 
THE PRIVATE PILOT CERTIFICATE. WHEN HE REACHED HIS FIRST DESTINATION 
AIRPORT, HE COULD NOT OBTAIN FUEL BECAUSE OF THE NEW YEARS HOLIDAY. HE 
FLEW TO ANOTHER NEARBY AIRPORT, AND HE COULD NOT OBTAIN FUEL THERE 
EITHER. FINALLY HE WAS ABLE TO LOCATE AN OPEN FBO AND PROCEEDED THERE 
FOR FUEL. HE INFORMED HIS INSTRUCTOR VIA TELEPHONE THAT HE HAD BEEN 
DELAYED AND ASKED FOR SOMEONE TO FLY DOWN AND PICK HIM UP, SINCE HE 
MIGHT NOT MAKE IT BACK PRIOR TO SUNSET. THE INSTRUCTOR TOLD HIM TO FUEL 
THE AIRPLANE AND RETURN HOME. DURING THE RETURN LEG, IT BECAME DARK. 
WHILE ESTABLISHED ON FINAL APPROACH FOR LANDING, THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED 
WITH TREES LOCATED UNDER THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE. THE PILOT LATER 
REPORTED THAT HE NEVER SAW THE TREES, AND HE FAILED TO UTILIZE THE 
AIRCRAFT LANDING LIGHT. THE PILOT HAD A TOTAL FLIGHT TIME OF 57 HOURS, 
INCLUDING 3 AT HOURS AT NIGHT. HIS PREVIOUS NIGHT FLIGHT WAS FLOWN 5 
MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE POOR JUDGEMENT OF THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR IN ALLOWING HIS STUDENT 
TO RETURN FROM A CROSS COUNTRY AT NIGHT, AND THE STUDENT PILOT'S 
FAILURE TO MAINTAIN A PROPER ALTITUDE ON FINAL APPROACH. FACTORS WERE 
THE DARK NIGHT CONDITIONS, THE TREES BELOW THE FINAL APPROACH PATH, 
THE FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO UTILIZE THE AIRCRAFT LANDING LIGHT, AND THE 
STUDENT PILOT'S LACK OF TOTAL EXPERIENCE IN NIGHT FLYING.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
