Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On September 2, 1993, at approximately 1100 central daylight time, the pilot of a Cessna 
A185F, N6279E, became incapacitated while water taxiing the airplane at Pilottown, Louisiana, 
and  the airplane collided with a river bank, but was not damaged.   time later.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time, and no flight plan had been filed.
The following is based on a telephone interview with the aircraft owner and the subsequent 
Pilot/Operator Report (NTSB Form 6120.1/2) he submitted.  The pilot of N6279E landed on 
the river and his two passengers disembarked.  The owner flew over the river and saw the pilot 
wave at him.  Since the airplane was facing downwind, the owner believes the pilot untied the 
airplane with the intention of water taxiing into an upwind position before docking.
The owner reported he decided to orbit the area and wait for the pilot to report he was clear of 
the landing area.  When no report was received the owner attempted to contact the pilot via 
radio.  After receiving no answer he flew low over the water, observed the airplane taxiing 
slowly across the water, and saw the pilot slumped over the controls.  As the owner landed, he 
saw the airplane taxi into the river bank.  When he reached the airplane, he found the pilot had 
stopped breathing and had no pulse.  A  U.S. Coast Guard helicopter evacuated the pilot to a 
nearby hospital.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
An autopsy was performed by the Jefferson Parrish, Coroners Office in Gretna, Louisiana. 
Cause of the pilot's death was attributed to "acute coronary insufficiency due to atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease and abnormal coronary artery distribution."  Toxicological protocol was 
negative for ethyl alcohol, carbon monoxide, and drugs.
The Federal Aviation Administration's medical certification file revealed that in September 
1962, the pilot was diagnosed as having a "slight systolic heart murmur" that was "probably 
functional" and "probably associated with a slight pes cavum deformity of the chest."  The 
electrocardiogram was "generally within normal limits."  In September 1989, an FAA airman 
medical examiner detected a "mild expansive pulsation of the abdominal aorta" and "post 
exercise mild tachycardia," and the pilot was denied medical certification.  Subsequent tests 
made by a non-FAA physician disclosed "no evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm" and 
the pilot was granted a class medical certificate in October.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
