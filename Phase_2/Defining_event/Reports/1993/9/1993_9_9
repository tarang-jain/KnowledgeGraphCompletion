Analysis 
AS THE CAPTAIN WAS TURNING THE AIRPLANE OFF THE RUNWAY FOLLOWING ITS 
LANDING ROLL HE SAID IT WAS '...EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO TURN.' THE CAPTAIN 
SAID THE AIRPLANE TURNED TO A 45 DEGREE ANGLE TO THE RUNWAY AND WOULD 
GO NO FURTHER. THE STEERING SYSTEM FAILED AND THE CAPTAIN ATTEMPTED TO 
STOP THE AIRPLANE ON THE TAXIWAY USING BRAKES AND REVERSE THRUST.  THE 
AIRPLANE WOULD NOT STOP AND ROLLED OFF ONTO THE GRASS AREA ADJACENT 
TO THE TAXIWAY.  EXAMINATION OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM FOUND THE HYDRAULIC 
SYSTEM POWER TRANSFER UNIT'S (PTU) HOUSING WAS CRACKED AROUND ITS 
ENTIRE CIRCUMFERENCE.  THE PTU ON THE INCIDENT AIRPLANE WAS AN EARLY 
STYLE UNIT ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER'S SERVICE BULLETIN.  THE 
SERVICE BULLETIN ADVISED OWNERS OF THE AIRPLANE TO REPLACE THE 
ORIGINAL ALUMINUM HOUSING WITH A CAST IRON TYPE.  EXAMINATION OF THE 
PTU'S HOUSING FRACTURE SURFACES REVEALED SHRINKAGE CAVITIES, AND LARGE 
SILICON INCLUSIONS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
a fatigue failure of the power transfer unit caused by a material defect which resulted in a total 
hydraulic system failure.

Factual Information
 On September 2, 1993, at 1203 central daylight time, a McDonnell-Douglas DC-9-82, 
N918TW, operated by Trans World Airlines, Incorporated, as Flight 359, experienced a total 
hydraulic failure while taxiing to the parking gate after landing.  The 14 CFR Part 121 flight had 
been operating on an IFR flight plan.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of 
the incident. The pilot, three flight attendants, and 103 passengers were not injured.  The flight 
originated from New York, New York, at 1026 eastern daylight time.
The captain on Flight 359 stated:  "At approximately 700 AFE I completed the landing check 
list and noted that there were no warning lights illuminated on the annunciator panel.  
Touchdown and initial roll-out were normal and F/O Harski initiated proper reverse and 
braking techniques slowing the aircraft to approximately 65 knots."  The captain said he took 
control of the aircraft at this time and continued braking the aircraft.
When the airplane was slowed to four to five knots, the captain said he attempted to turn the 
airplane's nose wheel to exit the runway.  "...I attempted to turn the nose wheel steering wheel 
to exit the runway but found that it was extremely difficult to turn."  He stated he was able to 
turn the aircraft to a 45 degree angle to the runway heading.  The captain said he "...found out 
that not only could I not turn the aircraft any further to the left but also I could not straighten 
out the nosewheel."  The pilot stated he applied brakes and found them not available.  He said, 
"I applied full left rudder in hope this would further turn the airplane so that I could position 
the airplane..." on the taxiway.
The airplane turned back onto the taxiway and the pilot attempted to use reverse thrust to stop 
it.  Reverse thrust did not stop the airplane and it rolled off the edge, coming to a stop in the 
grass area adjacent to the taxiway.
According to the captain, he and the first officer confirmed "...that the hydraulic gauges 
indicated that both left and right reservoirs had sufficient fluid in them to provide hydraulic 
pressure.  We also confirmed that all four hydraulic pumps were on."
The on-scene investigation revealed the power transfer unit (PTU) made the hydraulic system 
pressure go to zero when it was opened while operating on the left or right hydraulic system.  
Closing the PTU returned the hydraulic system to normal.  Examination of the PTU housing 
revealed it was cracked around its entire circumference. Hydraulic fluid had not leaked from 
the crack in the unit.
A November 9, 1992, Allied-Signal Aerospace Company service bulletin that applied to 
N918TW recommended the PTU's cast aluminum housings be replaced with a wrought iron 
housing due to previous unit housing cracking history.  N918TW's PTU was the cast aluminum 
type.
A McDonnell-Douglas service bulletin addressed procedures to handle low hydraulic pressure 
with the system annunciator lights illuminated.  According to the flight crew, the system 
annunciator lights were not illuminated.  The company's maintenance personnel performed an 
operational check of the annunciator panel.  The check showed the system annunciator lights 
were functional.
The NTSB's Materials Laboratory Division examined the PTU housing.  The report states:  
"Visual examination of the housing fracture surface indicated that the fracture was brittle and 
Page 4 of 6CHI93IA352
had no evidence of plastic deformation."  The housing's fatigue fracture covered approximately 
270 degrees of the circumference.  The remaining portion of the fracture was typical of 
overstress separation.  Examination revealed that in some areas the fatigue features stemmed 
from large shrinkage cavities.  The metallurgists report states:  "However, the vast majority of 
the fatigue crack origins were associated with large inclusions, which were identified as silicon 
inclusions... ." 
The Allied Signal and McDonnell-Douglas service bulletins are appended to this report.  The 
NTSB's Materials Laboratory Division metallurgist's report is appended to this report.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
