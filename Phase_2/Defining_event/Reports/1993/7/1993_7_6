Analysis 
 WHILE ON A STUDENT SOLO CROSS COUNTRY TRAINING FLIGHT, THE ALTERNATOR 
FAILED AND THE STUDENT FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE FAILURE.  THE LORAN, 
WHICH HE WAS USING FOR NAVIGATION, FAILED SO HE SWITCHED TO THE VOR.  
THAT ALSO FAILED AND HE THEN NOTICED HIS FUEL GAUGES WERE LOW AND 
THOUGHT HE WAS RUNNING OUT OF FUEL.  THE STUDENT PILOT ATTEMPTED TO 
LAND ON A RURAL ROAD AND WENT OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD INTO A DITCH. THE 
FLIGHT DEPARTED WITH FULL FUEL WHICH PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY 4 HOURS 
AND 30 MINUTES ENDURANCE. THE ACTUAL DURATION OF THE FLIGHT WAS 1 HOUR 
AND 45 MINUTES. 
Probable Cause and Findings

 FAILURE OF THE STUDENT PILOT TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT 
DURING LANDING ROLL.  FACTORS WERE:  ALTERNATOR FAILURE, FAILURE OF THE 
STUDENT PILOT TO FOLLOW PROCEDURES AND DIRECTIVES, AND FAILURE OF THE 
STUDENT PILOT TO PERFORM FUEL CONSUMPTION CALCULATIONS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
