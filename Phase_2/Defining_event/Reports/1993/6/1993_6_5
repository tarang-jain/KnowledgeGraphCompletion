ANOTHER SCHOOL AIRPLANE HAD EARLIER MADE A FORCED LANDING IN A FIELD 
NEAR THE AIRPORT, AND SCHOOL PERSONNEL HAD TRAVELLED TO THE SITE OF 
THE DOWNED AIRPLANE. AS THEY WERE EXAMINING THE DOWNED AIRPLANE, 
THEY OBSERVED THIS AIRPLANE CIRCLING THE DOWNED AIRPLANE FROM 500 FT 
AGL INITIALLY DOWN TO ABOUT 150 FT AGL IN SLOW FLIGHT WHERE IT STALLED 
AND SPUN TO THE GROUND. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AIRSPEED WHILE MANEUVERING 
AT LOW ALTITUDE. A FACTOR WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE 
PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE ALTITUDE FROM WHICH A RECOVERY 
WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE.

Factual Information
 On June 1, 1993, about 1930 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 152, N67571, registered to Silver 
Express, experienced an in-flight loss of control and crashed about 12 nautical miles west-
southwest of the Tamiami Airport, Miami, Florida, while on a 14 CFR Part 91 instructional 
flight.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for 
the local flight.  The airplane was destroyed and the certified flight instructor (CFI), and 
student were fatally injured.  The flight originated about 1730 from the Tamiami Airport.
According to the owner of the flight school, before the accident airplane crashed, another 
school airplane had performed a forced landing due to water in the fuel system.  He and two 
mechanics along with the CFI and student from the forced landing airplane were in the 
immediate vicinity, when the accident airplane began circling about 500 feet above ground 
level (agl).  The airplane descended to about 150 feet agl when the nose of the airplane dropped 
and the airplane descended and impacted the ground.  He further stated that he did not hear 
any unusual sounds from the engine before the loss of control.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
