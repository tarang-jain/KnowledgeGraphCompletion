Factual Information
 On June 2, 1993, at approximately 1700 central daylight time, a Grumman    G 164A airplane, 
N6752Q, was destroyed upon impact with power lines and terrain while maneuvering near 
Ganado, Texas. The commercial pilot, sole occupant of the airplane, was fatally injured. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed for the aerial application flight. The airplane was owned 
and operated by Arenosa Flying service of Edna, Texas.
According to the operator, the pilot was assigned to spray fertilizer on rice fields about two and 
a half miles north of Ganado, Texas, off Farm to Market Road 710 in Jackson County. The 
collision with the wires occurred as the airplane was completing the last pass on the last flight 
of the day.
According to witnesses at the accident site, the airplane was spraying on a field traversed from 
east to west by power lines suspended between towers. The airplane was observed striking the 
power lines and impacting the flooded rice field in a nose low attitude, coming to rest inverted.
An autopsy and toxicology tests were ordered and performed. The autopsy was performed by 
Roberto J. Bayardo, M.D, Chief Medical Examiner for Travis County on June 3, 1993. 
Toxicological reports submitted by the Civil Aeromedical Institute were negative.
The airplane was released to the owner at the accident site on June 4, 1993.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
