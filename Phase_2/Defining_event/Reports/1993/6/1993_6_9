Factual Information
 On June 2, 1993, at approximately 0640 central daylight time, a Grumman G-164B airplane, 
N48659, was destroyed upon impact with wires and terrain while maneuvering near Walnut 
Ridge, Arkansas. The commercial pilot, sole occupant of the airplane, was seriously injured. 
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the aerial application flight.
According to a relative of the operator, the airplane departed the Hicks Airstrip, near Walnut 
Ridge, Arkansas, with a load of pesticides earlier that morning. It was reported to him, that 
after reversing direction upon completion of the last pass, the airplane struck powerlines 
running across the perimeter of the field being sprayed. The pilot reported that he had been 
spraying this fiels for the last twienty years and was aware of the location of the powerlines. 
The pilot suffered serious back injuries and did not complete NTSB Form 6120.1/2. No 
maintenance anomalies were reported by the pilot prior to the accident.
The wreckage was verbally released to the owner's representative by the Federal Aviation

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
