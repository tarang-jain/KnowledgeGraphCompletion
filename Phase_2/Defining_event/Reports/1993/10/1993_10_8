LEVEL, 90 DEGREES TO THE LONG AXIS OF THE BOX CANYON. THE GLACIER AND 
SURROUNDING MOUNTAINS WERE COVERED WITH FRESH SNOW.

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S ATTEMPT TO FLY VFR INTO IMC CONDITIONS. A FACTOR 
WAS THE WHITEOUT WEATHER CONDITION.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
     On October 2, 1993, at 1430 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Maule M-6-235 
airplane, N5647N, registered to the Pilot- in-Command, collided with glacier/terrain while 
maneuvering to reverse direction in a large box canyon located immediately southeast of 
Merrill Pass.  The business flight, operating under 14 CFR Part 91, last departed Merrill Field, 
Anchorage, Alaska, and the destination was Bethel, Alaska.  The Private Certificated Pilot-in-
Command, the sole occupant, was fatally injured, and the airplane was substantially damaged.  
A visual flight rules flight plan was filed, and according to witnesses on the west side of Merrill 
Pass, marginal visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
     The 53 year old Pilot-in-Command was the holder of a Private Pilot certificate, number 
1618778, with airplane single engine land and sea ratings.  He was also the holder of a Federal 
Aviation Administration class 3 medical certificate, with no limitations, dated 4/22/93.
     Examination of the Pilot-in-Command's logbook showed that he met the requirements for a 
biennial flight review based upon the issuance of his Airplane Single Engine Sea Rating on 
April 25, 1992.
     The records show that the Pilot did not possess an instrument rating and his logbook 
showed only 5.4 hours of simulated hood time, only 4.1 hours of simulator time, and no actual 
weather experience.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
     The airplane, N5647N, was registered to the Pilot-in-Command and the aircraft logbooks 
show that the airplane had been removed from floats and placed on wheel landing gear on 
9/28/93 at tach time 1384.8.  The tach time at the accident site read 1386.0.
     The logbook records show that the Emergency Locator Beacon battery was to be replaced in 
Jul, 1994.
     The engine, serial number L-21934-48A, capable of producing 230 horsepower had received 
an oil and filter change at tach time of 1384.8.  It was last inspected on June 21, 1993, in 
accordance with a 100 hour inspection.  The engine had a total time of 1386.0 hours since new 
and had not been overhauled.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
     The Pilot-in-Command received a full weather briefing from the Kenai Automated Flight 
Service Station.  The Pilot's route of flight would have taken him through Merrill Pass, 
Sparrevohn,and on to Bethel, Alaska.  The weather briefer told the Pilot that the weather had 
been below VFR in the Sparrevohn area for the last three hours and that VFR flight was not 
recommended.  The pilot received this briefing twice, once at 0806 adt and 1127 adt.  
     Sparrevohn is located approximately 40 miles west of the Alaska Range and beyond the 
western exit of Merrill Pass.
     The general area forecast, received by the Pilot the day before the accident, called for 
marginal conditions with snow and the possibility of low level wind shears.  Merrill Pass was 
Page 3 of 6ANC94FA001
forecast to be VFR but turbulent.  The Bethel area forecast, the Pilot's destination, called for 
worsening conditions due to ceilings and snow showers.
     The accident site was covered with fresh fallen snow with a light dusting of snow on the 
airplane.  The site was located in a box canyon and the surrounding mountains shadowed the 
wreckage.  The surrounding terrain was also covered white with snow.
     There are no weather reporting facilities within Merrill Pass.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
     The airplane wreckage was found in a box canyon that was 1/4 mile wide and 3.25 miles 
long.  The slope in the canyon was 10 degrees down slope from the wreckage.  The canyon floor 
was covered with a glacier and was completely snow covered.  There were no open crevasses 
visible, however, there were snow bridges visible from on the ground near the wreckage.  The 
canyon walls on all three sides were near vertical and the lowest point along the canyon wall 
was 1300 feet above the wreckage site (5300 feet above mean sea level).  The magnetic path 
into the canyon was 184 degrees.
     The airplane wreckage was found at the 4000 foot level of the glacier in the canyon 
approximately .25 mile from the rear canyon wall.  The airplane's wreckage path and heading 
were 269 degrees.  The first impact mark was a scar in the snow cause by the left wing.  The 
fuselage impacted the snow approximately 10 feet beyond the left wing ground scar.  The 
airplane came to rest 55 feet beyond the left wing ground scar. 
     The engine remained attached to the right side of the firewall and was skewed to the right.  
The propeller separated from the engine and was located 10 feet beyond the engine and slightly 
left of the crash path.  Examination of the propeller blades showed that both blades were bent, 
one forward and one rearward.  Both blades had chordwise scoring and damage.
     The left wing was folded rearward with the leading edge pointing downward.  The left wing 
tip was crushed more severely than the right wing tip and the leading edge of the left wing tip 
was rolled under the wing.  The forward wing attach point of the left wing separated from the 
cabin top.  The wing struts were bent.
     The right wing was also bent rearward slightly and downward. Both wing attach points 
remained attached to the cabin top.  The wing struts were bent.
     The empennage was twisted slightly and the horizontal stabilizer, elevators, vertical fin, and 
rudder were not damaged.
      The bottom of the cockpit and cabin were pushed upward into the fuselage.  The amount of 
crush was not measured due to the snow coverage of the lower fuselage.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
     Merrill Pass is a widely used pass that transects the Alaska Range on an East/West course.  
The Eastern end of the pass is wide and continually narrows until reaching the actual pass.  
The actual pass requires the accomplishment of a left 70 degree turn and then a right 45 to 50 
degree turn to successfully negotiate the pass.  Once those turns are made the pass begins to 
widen.  The terrain slowly rises along the flight path until passing through the two turns.  The 
maximum elevation necessary to clear the pass is approximately 3400 feet above mean sea 
level.  The terrain begins to descend once passing through the turns in the pass.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
