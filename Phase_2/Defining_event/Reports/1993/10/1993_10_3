Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
TUCSON, AZ
Accident Number:
LAX94LA001
Date & Time:
10/01/1993, 1220 MST 
Registration:
N5151A
Aircraft:
CESSNA O-2A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Ferry
Analysis 
The front and then rear engines lost partial power during initial climb from the Ryan Field near 
Tucson, Arizona. Unable to continue climbing, the pilot made a forced landing in rough terrain 
about two miles east of the airport.  An examination of the airplane's fuel system revealed two 
of the front engine's six fuel injectors were partially clogged with a foreign substance.  No 
clogging of the rear injectors was found.  Prior to the accident (ferry) flight, the airplane had 
been idle for several years.  In preparation for the flight, recent maintenance which included 
limited purging of the fuel system had reportedly been accomplished by contractor 
maintenance personnel. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
was the partial loss of engine power during initial climb due to partial clogging of the engine's 
fuel injectors. Blockage of the fuel injectors was due to inadequate maintenance of the fuel 
system by contract maintenance personnel.

Factual Information
 On October 1, 1993, at 1220 mountain standard time, a Cessna O- 2A, N5151A, experienced a 
partial loss of engine power to the front and rear engines during initial climb from the Ryan 
Field near Tucson, Arizona.  The pilot made a forced landing in an open field about two miles 
east of the airport.  The airplane was substantially damaged upon impacting the rough, desert 
terrain.  The commercial pilot was not injured.  The flight was originating at the time of the 
mishap.
The pilot verbally reported that prior to the accident flight the airplane had been idle for 
several years.  The pilot had been hired to ferry the airplane from Arizona to the southeast 
United States.  In preparation for the flight, a contractor had performed limited maintenance 
on the airplane.
According to the pilot, during takeoff the airplane's front engine suddenly lost power.  Its rpm 
reduced from full power to about 1,600 rpm, and then the rear engine lost power.  The fuel flow 
became "low and intermittent" and the airplane stopped climbing.  The pilot further reported 
that because the engines' oil temperature and pressure remained in the normal operating 
range, he believed both engines had experienced fuel starvation.
On October 7, 1993, a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness inspector verbally 
reported to the National Transportation Safety Board that its examination of the airplane 
revealed two of the front engine's six fuel injectors were found partially clogged with a foreign 
substance.  The FAA inspector stated that the contractor had evidently not completely purged 
the airplane's entire fuel system during efforts at preparing the airplane for the ferry flight.
In October of 1993 and in May of 1994, the pilot was requested to complete the required Safety 
Board "Aircraft Accident Report," NTSB Form 6120.1.  When the Board receives the pilot's 
form, it will be appended to this report.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
