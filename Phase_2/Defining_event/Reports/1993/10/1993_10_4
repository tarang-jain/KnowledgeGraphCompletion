Location:
FALLON, NV
Accident Number:
LAX94LA002
Date & Time:
10/01/1993, 1830 PDT 
Registration:
N4266V
Aircraft:
CESSNA 170
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that he had just purchased the airplane, and the accident occurred during 
his familiarization flight.  The pilot took off and, along with the previous owner, flew to a local 
practice area.  The previous owner demonstrated airwork and then demonstrated a takeoff and 
a landing.  According to the pilot, he then attempted to land the airplane.  During his first 
approach, he 'waved off.'  The pilot further reported that during his second approach he was 
low.  The pilot added full engine power, and the airplane's main landing gear collided with the 
airport's perimeter fence short of the runway.  The pilot had not flown any airplane during the 
previous 90 days.  Also, he had no previous piloting experience in the accident make and model 
airplane. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
was the pilot's failure to maintain an adequate approach path to the runway and his inadequate 
altitude.  Contributing factors were the pilot's delayed remedial action and his lack of recent 
experience in the airplane.

Factual Information
 On October 1, 1993, at 1830 Pacific daylight time, a Cessna 170, N4266V, operated by the pilot, 
collided with the airport's perimeter fence on short final approach to runway 31 at the Fallon 
Municipal Airport, Fallon, Nevada.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of 
the personal flight.  The airplane was substantially damaged and the commercial pilot was not 
injured.  The passenger received minor injuries.  The flight originated from Fallon at 1750.
The pilot reported that he had just purchased the airplane, and the purpose of the flight was for 
his familiarization.  The pilot reported that he took off and flew to a local practice area with the 
seller of the airplane on board.  The seller demonstrated airwork, and then demonstrated a 
takeoff and a landing.  The pilot further reported he then made an approach to runway 31, 
"waved off," and attempted another landing.
Regarding the attempted landing, the pilot made the following statement in his completed 
"Aircraft Accident Report," NTSB Form 6120.1:  "When I realized I was landing short...I added 
full power to make a go-around.  The main landing gear caught the perimeter fence and the 
aircraft came to rest on its right side."
The pilot indicated that he had not flown any airplane during the 90 days which preceded the 
accident.  Also, his total piloting experience in the accident airplane's make and model was zero 
hours.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
