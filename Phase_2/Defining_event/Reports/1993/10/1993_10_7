Analysis 
DURING CRUISE A TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER OCCURRED AND THE PILOT 
INITIATED A FORCED LANDING AT A NEARBY AIRPORT. DURING HIS APPROACH TO 
RUNWAY 03 THE PILOT EXTENDED HIS PATTERN DUE TO A GLIDER IN TOW IN THE 
LANDING PATTERN. THE AIRCRAFT TOUCHED DOWN 100 FEET SHORT OF THE 
RUNWAY COMING TO REST ON THE RUNWAY IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS. THE 
AIRCRAFT SUSTAINED UPWARDS CRUSHING OF THE FUSELAGE UNDERSIDE. THE 
FLAPS WERE FOUND TO BE RETRACTED AND THE GEAR WERE WITHIN THEIR 
WHEEL WELLS. POST CRASH EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT THE ROLL PIN WHICH 
ENGAGES THE FUEL SELECTOR HANDLE TO THE FUEL SELECTOR VALVE SHAFT WAS 
ABSENT, AND THE HANDLE WAS OBSERVED TO ROTATE FREELY ON THE VALVE 
SHAFT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
FUEL STARVATION BROUGHT ON BY THE ABSENCE OF THE ROLL PIN WHICH 
ENGAGES THE FUEL SELECTOR HANDLE TO THE FUEL SELECTOR VALVE SHAFT, AND 
THE PILOT IN COMMAND'S MISJUDGING HIS FLARE RESULTING IN A HARD 
LANDING.

Factual Information
 On October 1, 1993, at approximately 1130 hours mountain daylight time (MDT), a Beech A35, 
N667B, registered to Robert R. and Bobbi Sue Weyland, and being flown by Jerald D. King, a 
certificated private pilot, was substantially damaged during a hard landing just short of runway 
3 at the Heber Valley Airport, Heber City, Utah. The pilot and his two passengers were 
uninjured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan had been 
filed. The flight, which was personal in nature, was to have been operated in accordance with 
the requirements set forth in 14CFR91 and originated from Salt Lake City (Municipal Airport 
No. 2) at approximately 0830 hours.
Two certified requests for the completion of NTSB Form 6120.1/2 were issued to the pilot, 
however, no response was received as of the date of this report.
An FAA inspector reported that the aircraft impacted the ground approximately 100 feet short 
of the runway and slid up onto the pavement resulting in the collapse of the partially extended 
landing gear and upward crushing of the aircraft's underside (refer to attached FAA Form 
8020-16).
The pilot reported to the FAA inspector that while on a local flight he lost engine power and, 
after being unable to restart the engine, set up for an emergency landing at the Heber Valley 
Airport. The pilot reported that he extended his approach turn during the forced landing due to 
a glider under tow in the landing pattern, and touched down short of the landing threshold.
The FAA inspector who examined the aircraft subsequent to the accident reported that the roll 
pin inserted through the fuel selector handle and into the fuel selector valve shaft was absent 
(refer to photograph 01). The fuel selector handle was found to rotate freely about the fuel 
selector valve shaft during the examination. A search for the roll pin was undertaken, however, 
the pin could not be located.
Post crash examination of the airframe revealed that the flaps were retracted and the landing 
gear were within their respective wheel wells with minimal damage to the underside of the 
wing surfaces (refer to photographs 02 and 03).

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
