Analysis 
 WHILE RETURNING TO THE AIRPORT FROM AN INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT, THE 
ENGINE 'HAD A SUDDEN POWER DROP OF 1300 TO 1400 RPM,'  ACCORDING TO THE 
CFI.  THE CFI 'WENT THROUGH THE EMERGENCY CHECKLIST' AND 'COULD NOT 
HOLD ALTITUDE.' THE ENGINE LOST ALL POWER WHEN THE LEFT MAGNETO WAS 
SELECTED.  THE CFI PERFORMED A FORCED LANDING ON SHORT, SOFT, HILLY 
TERRAIN, AND THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER. THE FLAPS WERE FOUND IN THE 
RETRACTED POSITION, ALTHOUGH THE FLAP SELECTOR SWITCH WAS FOUND IN 
THE FULLY EXTENDED POSITION.  AN EXAMINATION OF THE AIRPLANE DID NOT 
REVEAL ANY MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS. BOTH MAGNETOS WERE 
FUNCTIONALLY TESTED AND MET MANUFACTURER'S TOLERANCES. THE 
TEMPERATURE AND DEW POINT WERE 38 AND 20 DEG, RESPECTIVELY.  ACCORDING 
TO CARBURETOR ICING PROBABILITY CHARTS, CONDITIONS WERE CONDUCIVE TO 
VISIBLE ICING AT GLIDE AND CRUISE POWER; THE CARBURETOR HEAT WAS FOUND 
IN A MIDWAY POSITION. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DUE TO UNDETERMINED REASONS.  A FACTOR RELATED 
TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE SHORT, SOFT, HILLY TERRAIN CONDITION IN THE 
EMERGENCY LANDING AREA.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
