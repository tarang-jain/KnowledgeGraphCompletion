Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On November 1, 1993, at 2220 eastern standard time, a Piper PA- 32RT-300T, N964ST, 
collided with trees about 600 yards northeast of the Wrens Memorial Airport, Wrens, Georgia. 
The pilot was attempting an emergency landing when the collision occurred. The flight 
operated under 14 CFR Part 91 with an instrument flight clearance. Visual weather conditions 
prevailed at the time of the accident. The airplane was destroyed by impact forces and a post 
crash fire; four of the five occupants were fatally injured, and the pilot received serious injuries. 
The flight departed Augusta, Georgia, at 2201. 
Approximately fifteen minutes into the flight, cruising at 6000 feet, the pilot reported an 
engine problem. Moments later, the pilot reported to Augusta Departure Control that the 
engine had stopped. The flight was cleared to the Wrens Memorial Airport that was located 
seven miles west of the flight's position. Seconds before the collision, a witness reported that 
the pilot turned on the landing lights, and that the airplane appeared to have been established 
on a final approach to the southwest runway. The airplane collided with trees prior to reaching 
the runway. 
Examination of the engine revealed that there was fracture damage to internal drive gears. The 
accessory housing was not damaged, externally. 
PERSONNEL INFORMATION    
Information on the pilot is included in this report at the data field labeled "First Pilot 
Information". The pilot's flight logs were not recovered for examination. 
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
Information on the aircraft is contained in this report at the data field labeled "Aircraft 
Information". An overview of the engine components is shown in figure 1, as received.  A 
review of the engine maintenance logs disclosed that the last entrance was made on October 
25, 1993.  At that time, the engine had 2,078 hours of total time, 241.4 of which had been since 
the last overhaul.  The review also revealed that the propeller assembly  had been repaired on 
June 21, 1993, as a result of a propeller strike.  The annual inspection of the engine was 
performed on September 9, 1993.  An examination of the engine case disclosed that the engine 
case had been stamped with the marking  "AJAX 93779904" indicating that it was twice 
subjected to repairs by AJAX. 
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
Visual weather conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. Weather information is 
contained in the report at the data field labeled "Weather Information".
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The airplane collided with tree 1/4 mile east of the Wrens Memorial Airport in Wrens, Georgia. 
The metallurgist's examination of engine components disclosed the following:
     Examination of the front end of the engine case disclosed      that a set screw that prevents 
rotation of the governor      drive idler gear shaft inside the bore was missing and a      portion of 
the boss surrounding the screw was broken.  The      screw had been recovered after the 
Page 4 of 7ATL94FA011
accident during original      dissembly of the engine.
     The governor gear train was disassembled and the liberated      gears were examined visually 
and with the aid of a bench      binocular microscope.  The governor idler bevel gear and the      
governor shaft gear teeth had spalling at the pitch line on      the pressure faces.  Splines on the 
governor shaft had      plastic deformation consistent with heavy loading; The      governor idler 
shaft had circumferential score marks at both      ends.
     Examination of the aft end of the engine case revealed that      the boss for the idler gear 
shaft was broken.  Visual and      magnified examination revealed that the separation of the      
boss occurred as a result of overload, and there was no      signs of progressive cracking on the 
fracture surface.  The      bore in the boss appeared to be fairly cylindrical and was      
approximately 0.870 inch in diameter.  Measurements      indicated that the corresponding 
diameter of the shaft was      0.690 inch.  AJAX Aviation , Inc. work order No. 9904, the      boss 
for the idler gear was repaired on May 26, 1992.  A      representative of AJAX stated that 
during this repair the      bore in the boss was enlarged and a bushing was installed by      press 
fitting.  The bushing (or its remnants) was not      submitted for examination.  AJAX reportedly 
keeps records of      work orders for a duration of only two years.
     Further inspection of the aft end of the engine revealed      that a portion of the magneto gear 
boss was cut off or      ground by a contact with the idler gear teeth.  The teeth      imprints were 
visible on the cut surface of the magneto gear      boss when viewed under oblique light.  The 
depth of the cut      was approximately 0.004 inch.
     Examination of the accessory housing revealed that a portion      of the boss for the idler gear 
shaft was broken off.
     The fracture face on the broken off piece was examined with      the bench binocular 
microscope and then at higher      magnifications with a scanning electron microscope (SEM).       
The fracture surface features wee completely obliterated by      post fracture damage in some 
areas.  Examination of the      undamaged regions showed dimpled fracture mode consistent      
with an overstress separation.
     Examination of the forward end of the camshaft revealed no      damage to the governor 
drive gear.  The driving faces on the      gear teeth were slightly polished, typical of normal tooth      
wear.  Examination of the aft end of the camshaft revealed      heavy grinding damage to the 
forward portions of the top      faces in six (6) adjacent teeth of the aft camshaft gear.
     Substantial portions of the two adjacent teeth were broken      off at the forward end of the 
gear.  Magnified inspection      disclosed that these teeth broke as a result of overload.       
Severe plastic deformation and cracking were observed on the      forward portions of the top 
and driving faces of all other      gear teeth.
     The idler gear contains two differing diameter gear teeth.       The larger diameter gear teeth 
(forward teeth) are driven by      the crankshaft gear and drives the camshaft gear.  The      
smaller diameter gear teeth (aft teeth) drives the magneto      drive gear.  Two teeth were 
missing from the larger diameter      gear teeth.  All remaining teeth in this gear had either      
heavy pitting or spalling along the pitch line.
     Segments of the gear containing the missing teeth were cut      off and the fracture faces were 
examined with the      stereomicroscope and then at higher magnifications with the      SEM.
     Approximately 80% of the fracture surface area in the tooth      was relatively smooth and 
Page 5 of 7ATL94FA011
contained crack arrest positions      characteristic of fatigue cracking.  The fatigue cracking      
originated at the root of the tooth.  SEM examination      revealed fissuring (micro cracking) in 
the fatigue zone and      dimpled rupture mode in the overstress separation zone.
     Examination at higher magnifications with SEM revealed micro      fissuring, typical of 
fatigue cracking.  The fatigue      cracking emanated from an area of the thread root and      
extended throughout almost the entire fracture surface.
     Both teeth faces of the larger diameter gear teeth are      pressure faces.  The fatigue cracking 
in teeth "1" and "2"      originated on the opposite sides of the teeth.
     The smaller diameter gear teeth also had two missing teeth.       Examination revealed that 
the breakage of this tooth      occurred as a result of overstress or after only a few      cycles of 
very high stress.
     Examination of the magneto drive gear disclosed pitting and      spalling along the pitch line 
of some of the teeth.  Plastic      deformation of the pressure faces in several teeth and a      
pattern of tooth contact imprints was consistent with      sliding of the mating gear under heavy 
loading.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
