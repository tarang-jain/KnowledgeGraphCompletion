Analysis 
THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH TREES ON A HILL, ABOUT 1/2 MILE FROM THE 
AIRPORT (LEB). THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS ABOUT 250 FEET ABOVE THE AIRPORT 
ELEVATION. THE PILOT WAS ON A CLEARANCE, IN PART, TO CLIMB TO 6000 FEET; HE 
WAS IN RADIO CONTACT WITH THE LEB TOWER CONTROLLER. THE CONTROLLER 
REPORTED HE NOTICED THE AIRPLANE HAD TURNED TOO FAR LEFT AFTER 
TAKEOFF AND IT WAS HEADED TOWARD A HILL. HE ASKED THE PILOT IF HAD HAD 
THE HILL IN SIGHT, AND THE PILOT RESPONDED 'SAY AGAIN.'  THE SURVIVING 
PASSENGER REPORTED HE OVERHEARD THE CONTROLLER CALLING THE PILOT TO 
ALERT HIM OF THE HILL AND THEREAFTER THE COLLISION OCCURRED. A SECOND 
PILOT WAS ABOARD, AS A SAFETY PILOT; HE WAS AN INSTRUMENT RATED FLIGHT 
INSTRUCTOR. ALTHOUGH BOTH PILOTS HAD PREVIOUSLY DEPARTED THE AIRPORT 
SEVERAL TIMES, ACCORDING TO THEIR LOGBOOKS, THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT WAS 
THEIR FIRST NIGHT DEPARTURE FROM THE AIRPORT. THE DEPARTURE PROCEDURE 
FOR THE AIRPORT, IN PART STATES, '...CLIMB VISUALLY OVER AIRPORT, TO CROSS 
THE AIRPORT AT OR ABOVE 1500 FEET, THEN PROCEED ON COURSE.' 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate terrain clearance which resulted in an inflight collision 
with the terrain.  A factor was a dark night condition.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
     On December 2, 1993, at 1728, an Aerospatiale TB-21, N28163, owned and operated by Mr. 
Klaus O. Eberius, of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, struck rising terrain after takeoff from Lebanon 
Municipal Airport, Lebanon, New Hampshire.  The airplane was destroyed by the impact.  The 
two pilots in the front were fatally injured.  The passenger in the rear seat received serious 
injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and the flight was operating on an 
instrument flight plan under 14 CFR Part 91.
     According to the FAA supplied transcript of air/ground communications between the 
Lebanon Air Traffic Control Tower, and N28163, at 1720:25, the pilot of N28163 contacted the 
Control Tower, and requested to taxi and receive his IFR clearance.  The following clearance 
was issued:
     Trinidad two eight one six three is cleared to the ah      charlie golf foxtrot airport as filed, 
maintain six      thousand, expect one zero thousand five minutes after      departure, departure 
frequency Boston Center will be      one three four point seven, squawk three four two six.
     The clearance was acknowledged by the pilot.
     At 1726:30, the pilot of N28163, said he was ready for takeoff.  At 1726:40, the pilot was 
cleared for takeoff.
     At 1728:30, the local controller said, "163, you have that hill in sight there?"
     At 1728:33, the pilot replied, "163, say again", and the local controller replied, "could you see 
that hill there."
     At 1728:36, the local controller again said, "163, how do you hear?"  No further 
communications were heard from the pilot of N28163.
     In a written statement, the local controller said:
     The aircraft appeared to depart normally, and started a      left turn.  When I observed that 
the aircraft was      turning too far left toward a hill that is adjacent to      the airport, I asked the 
pilot if he could see the      hill.  The pilot responded, "say again?", and I      repeated my 
question.  As I unkeyed my microphone, I      observed the aircraft's landing light shinning on 
the      tops of the trees near the peak of the hill, and the      aircraft appeared to pass behind the 
hill.  I attempted      to contact N28163, but there was no reply....
     The passenger was interviewed on December 4, 1993, in the hospital.  He said he had made 
this trip several times with both pilots.  He said that normally, the pilots would depart straight 
out and then turn on course.  He said the left seat pilot was the flying pilot, and he did not hear 
any conversation between the pilots after the takeoff clearance was issued.  He said he did not 
observe any warning lights in the cockpit, and did not know anything was wrong until he heard 
the local controller call the pilot's attention to the hill.  He said at this time he looked out and 
saw they were in the trees.
     The accident occurred during the hours of darkness at location, 43 degrees, 36 minutes, 54 
seconds North, 72 degrees, 17 minutes, 48 seconds West.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION

the preceding 90 days.
     The right seat pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with airplane single engine land and 
instrument airplane ratings.
Additionally, he held a flight instructor certificate for airplane single engine land and 
instrument airplane.  He held an FAA second class airman medical certificate with a limitation 
to wear corrective lenses, issued on July 19, 1993.  His log book, which was current through 
November 23, 1993, showed the last logged night time was on June 1, 1992.  His total logged 
night time was 166.4 hours.  He had no logged night landings within the preceding 90 days. 
     No logged flights were found for either pilot to indicate a night departure from Lebanon.  
The left seat had made 10 departures from Lebanon in the preceding 90 days.  The right seat 
flight instructor had made 8 departures from Lebanon in the preceding 90 days.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
     The airplane was a 1990 Aerospatiale TB-21.  The airplane received an annual inspection 
December 11, 1992.  The airplane had a total time of 461 hours and had accumulated 311 hours 
since the last annual inspection.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
     The 1740 observation at Lebanon recorded a ceiling of 14,000 feet broken, visibility 15 
miles, and winds calm.  The sun was 12.7 degrees below the horizon, and the moon was 18.7 
degrees below the horizon, at the time of the accident.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
     The wreckage was examined at the accident site on December 3, and 4, 1993.  The debris 
path was spread along a heading of 110 degrees for about 500 feet.  The first items noticed on 
the ground were small pieces of paint and plexiglass.  This continued for approximately 150 
feet after which portions of the left and right wing were found.  Pieces of airplane structure 
were found both on the ground and in trees.
     The first 400 feet of broken tree limbs were on an upward fight path.  The final 100 feet was 
on a downward flight path.   Trees in the area were estimated to be 75 to 100 feet high.
     In a daylight helicopter flight over the trees, the broken branches appeared to be in a 
straight line and not curved.  In addition, the width of the broken tree branches was similar to 
the wing span of the airplane.  The branches appear to be broken at the same height across the 
width of the area of broken branches.
     The airplane was on its left side with the flaps up and the landing gear retracted.  Both wings 
had impact damage, with the left wing separated from the airplane and in multiple pieces.  
Impact damage to the wings was oriented up/down across the leading edge.  
     Flight control continuity was verified between the cockpit, and rudder and elevator.  Flight 
control continuity to the ailerons was not determined due to impact damage.

     Both blades of the propeller were bent rearward and exhibited chord wise twisting near the 
tips.  
     The engine was separated from the firewall and located about 2 feet in front of the fuselage.  
Valve train continuity was verified through the accessory drive, with compression found in all 
cylinders.  
     Fuel was found in lines leading to the engine and in the engine accessories.  The engine 
controls were found in the full forward position, and the fuel valve was selected to the right 
tank.
     The airplane was equipped with two vacuum pumps.  The engine driven pump was located 
on the rear of the engine.  The electric auxiliary pump was mounted on the engine side of the 
firewall.  The shear shaft on the engine driven vacuum source was intact and the vanes were 
not broken.  The vacuum source selector was in the AUX SOURCE (auxiliary source) OFF 
position.  The lines from these 2 pumps are joined by "T" connector.  The "T" connector was 
pulled out of the line that leads through the firewall, to the attitude indicator.
     Filament stretch was found in the GYRO (vacuum) light.  The green status light AUX SUCT 
(auxiliary suction) did not have filament stretch.  These lights are mounted on the top center of 
the left instrument panel.  The pressure sensing switch for low vacuum pressure is located next 
to the attitude indicator. 
     Compression wrinkles were found on the fuselage skin between the instrument panel and 
the engine firewall.  The rubber line between the firewall and attitude indicator was bent 90 
degrees and twisted.  There were 2 breaks where the line was bent.
     The horizontal situation indicator (HSI) showed a heading of 120 degrees. 
     All navigation and communications radios were on.  All radio and instrument panel lights 
were set to the full bright position, except the engine lights, which were set to low.  
AERODROME INFORMATION
     According to the Jeppesen-Sanderson Company, instrument procedure chart for Lebanon, 
Hew Hampshire, (11-1) found in the wreckage, the IFR departure procedure for runway 18 is, 
"...climb visually over airport, to cross airport at or above 1500' [feet], then proceed on course."  
     Runway 18 was 5,200 feet long.  Red warning lights were visible on the left (east) side of the 
runway.  There were 29 lights mounted on poles about 30 feet high, which started prior to 
midfield, and extended 1200 feet past the departure end.
     A night helicopter flight was made over the accident area, just above the trees.  Once the 
flight passed the line of red warning lights, the flight had entered an area of no lighting except 
for red warning lights on the hill tops were not in line with the airplane flight path.  A rearward 
extension of the flight path through the trees crossed the red warning light prior to the end of 
the line.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
     Autopsies were conducted on December 3, 1993, by Dr. Foss, Chief Medical Examiner, for 
the State of New Hampshire, Concord, New Hampshire.  
     A toxicological scan for drugs and alcohol conducted by the FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute 
in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, was negative for drugs and alcohol.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
     The pilot would make frequent trips between his residence near Cleveland, Ohio, and 
Lebanon.  He also used the services of the flight instructor in the right seat as a safety pilot, and 
to ferry the airplane between these two locations.  
     According to airplane and pilot log book records, the pilot arrived in Lebanon on November 
21, 1993.  The airplane was flown to Ohio, by the flight instructor, and he returned to pick up 
the owner on December 2, 1993.  The IFR flight plan was filed by the flight instructor.  
According to a FAA supplied transcript, the following IFR clearance was filed for departure 
from Lebanon.
     ...route of flight will be radar vectors LEB Victor      four ninety six Utica direct Jamestown 
and then R-NAV      to CFG.
     The airplane was released to Mr. Al Ryan, of Ryan Insurance Services, Inc., the insurance 
adjustor on December 4, 1993.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
