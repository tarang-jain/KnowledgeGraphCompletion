Analysis 
The airplane was destroyed after impacting terrain during an approach in instrument 
meteorological conditions.  At the destination airport, weather was reported as 3 statute miles 
of visibility and mist, and an overcast cloud layer at 700 feet.  The overcast ceiling was variable 
from 400 to 1,100 feet agl.  The flight progressed without incident, and once in the vicinity of 
the destination airport, the pilot requested and was subsequently cleared for the GPS 
approach.  No further transmissions were received from the pilot.  The airplane struck trees, 
and came to rest in a wooded area, about 1-3/4 miles from the runway 32 threshold, and about 
1/2-mile right of the extended centerline.  A postcrash fire consumed the main wreckage.  The 
elevation of the accident site was 563 feet msl.  Review of the approach plate for the GPS 
approach revealed that the inbound course from the final approach fix, located about 5 miles 
prior to the airport, was 324 degrees.  The minimums for the straight in approach to runway 32 
were 1 statute mile of visibility, and a minimum decision altitude of 960 feet msl (624 feet agl).  
No procedure turn was required for the approach.  Review of radar data revealed that after the 
airplane crossed the final approach fix, it turned right, away from the final approach course, 
and began tracking northbound for several seconds.  The airplane then made a left turn and 
proceeded inbound towards the airport and tracked an approximate 300-degree course until 
the last radar return was received, where the airplane was about 1 mile southeast of the airport 
at 1,000 feet msl.  The pilot had accumulated about 409 hours of total flight experience.  
Within the previous 6 months, he had accumulated 7 hours, of which 1.7 hours were conducted 
in simulated instrument conditions, and .7 hours were in actual instrument conditions.  The 
pilot's most recent flight conducted in nighttime conditions was about 20 months prior to the 
accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to follow instrument flight procedures resulting in a collision with trees.  A 
factor related to the accident was the low cloud ceiling, and dark night.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On June 1, 2004, about 2131 eastern daylight time, a Piper PA-32-300, N21072, was destroyed 
after impacting terrain in Leominster, Massachusetts, during an approach to the Fitchburg 
Municipal Airport (FIT), Fitchburg, Massachusetts.  The certificated private pilot and 
passenger were fatally injured.  Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and an 
instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the flight that originated from the 
Manchester Airport (MHT), Manchester, New Hampshire.  The personal flight was conducted 
under 14 CFR Part 91.
According to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, the airplane was fueled 
earlier at FIT with 16.7 gallons of aviation fuel prior to departing for MHT to pick up the 
passenger.  Upon arriving at MHT, the airplane was refueled with 14.1 gallons of aviation fuel.  
The flight departed from MHT about 2109, and proceeded towards FIT.
Review of air traffic control data revealed that the pilot was instructed to "cross TOPTO at or 
above 2,500, cleared GPS 32 approach," which he acknowledged.  No further transmissions 
were received from the pilot.
Review of radar data obtained from the FAA revealed that the accident airplanes flight track 
began at 2108:50.  The airplane was at an altitude of 900 feet in the vicinity of MHT.  At 
2129:34, the airplane crossed abeam CLETR, the final approach fix for the GPS RWY 32 
approach at FIT.  At that point the airplane had been tracking a northwesterly heading 
approximately 320 degrees.  After passing CLETR, the airplane turned right, away from the 
final approach course, and began tracking northbound for several seconds.  At 2129:57, the 
airplane made a left turn and proceeded inbound towards the airport and tracked 
approximately a 300-degree course.  The last radar return was received at 2131:44, where the 
airplane was about 1 mile southeast of FIT at 1,000 feet, and a ground speed of 110 knots.
The airplane came to rest on its right side, on top of a stone wall, in a wooded area, about 1-3/4 
miles from the runway 32 threshold, and about 1/2-mile right of the extended centerline.  A 
postcrash fire consumed the main wreckage.
A witness, located about 1/2-mile southwest of the accident site, heard an airplane fly 
overhead.  The airplane noise was "louder than usual."  The witness looked out her window and 
observed an airplane flying over the tree tops, from right to left, and "the engine sounded fine.  
Just loud because the plane was so low."  The witness then heard a sound similar to "chopping 
of leaves from the tree tops," followed by silence, and a few seconds later, the sound of 
snapping trees.
The accident occurred during the hours of darkness, at 42 degrees, 32.430 minutes north 
longitude, 071 degrees, 43.18 minutes west latitude, at an elevation of 563 feet.
PILOT INFORMATION
The pilot held a private pilot certificate for airplane single-engine, and instrument airplane.  
The pilot's most recent application for a FAA third class medical certificate was dated on 
December 16, 2002.
Review of the pilot's logbook, which was found in the wreckage, revealed that he had 
Page 4 of 8NYC04FA136
accumulated about 409 hours of total flight experience.  Within the previous 6 months, he had 
accumulated 7 hours, of which 1.7 hours were conducted in simulated instrument conditions, 
and .7 hours were in actual instrument conditions.  The pilot's most recent flight conducted in 
nighttime conditions was on November 15, 2002.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
The airplane's most recent annual inspection was completed on May 6, 2004, at a total aircraft 
time of 3,087.9 hours.
The airplane was equipped with a Garmin GPS 400 unit, and an autopilot.  There were no 
documents recovered to confirm if the GPS unit was coupled to the autopilot.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
The weather reported at FIT, at 2117, included winds from 080 degrees at 4 knots; 3 statute 
miles of visibility; mist; an overcast cloud layer at 700 feet agl; temperature of 48 degrees 
Fahrenheit; dew point of 46 degrees Fahrenheit; and an altimeter setting of 29.80 inches of 
mercury.  The overcast ceiling was variable from 400 to 1,100 feet agl.
AIRPORT INFORMATION
The airport elevation at FIT was 348 feet msl.
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Review of the approach plate for the GPS Runway 32 approach at FIT revealed that the initial 
approach fix (IAF), TOPTO waypoint, was located 22.3 miles, outbound 211 degrees from the 
MHT VOR.  The outbound course from TOPTO was 234 degrees, and continued 5 miles to the 
DELSO waypoint.  The minimum altitude for the segment was 2,500 feet msl.  The final 
approach course from DELSO was 324 degrees, and continued 5 miles to the final approach fix 
(FAF), CLETR waypoint.  The minimum crossing altitude at CLETR was 2,000 feet msl.  
CLETR intersection was located 5 miles from the runway 32 threshold.  The minimums for the 
straight in approach to runway 32 were 1 statute mile of visibility, and a minimum decision 
altitude of 960 feet msl (624 feet agl).  No procedure turn was required for the approach.
WRECKAGE INFORMATION
Examination of the accident site on June 2, 2004, revealed terrain that consisted of evergreen 
and hardwood trees reaching a height of about 80 feet.  The foliage surrounding the accident 
site was wilted, consistent with being sprayed with aviation fuel and exposure to heat.   The 
wreckage path was about 280 feet in length, and was oriented on a 050-degree heading, with 
the main fuselage coming to rest on a 055-degree heading.
The first tree strike area was located about 250 feet prior to the main fuselage.  Surrounding 
the tree strike area, were branches of varying diameters that were cut at 45-degree angles and 
displayed black and red paint transfer.  Along the wreckage path were wing skin sections from 
the left wing and the empennage assembly.
All flight control surfaces were accounted for at the accident site.
When the right side of the stabilator was examined, a 3-inch deep u-shaped dent was present 
on the leading edge.  Tree bark was observed in the dent compression mark.

The 3-bladed propeller assembly was separated from the engine.  All three blades broke loose 
from the hub assembly, and were located about 30-40 feet beyond the main wreckage.  The 
blades displayed s-bending and leading edge nicks.  One blade exhibited chord-wise scratching.  
The propeller blades were painted black, with red and white stripes painted on the tips.
Examination of the cockpit area revealed that the fuel selector was in the "left" tank position, 
and that the flap handle was in retracted position.
The pilot's airspeed indicator was recovered, but sustained impact damage.  The airspeed 
indicator displayed a reading of 0 knots.  The altimeter displayed a reading of 495 feet.  The 
Kollsman window displayed an altimeter setting of 29.78 inches of mercury.  The attitude 
indicator and directional gyro were disassembled.  Evidence of rotational scoring was observed 
on the inside gyro rotor housings of both instruments.
The remaining primary flight instruments and engine instruments; the throttle, mixture, and 
propeller controls were destroyed. 
The engine was recovered from the accident site and examined on June 3, 2004.  The 
crankshaft was rotated through the accessory drive section.  Thumb compression and valve 
train continuity was confirmed to the number 3 through number 6 cylinders.  The number 1 
cylinder head was separated from its barrel, and disintegrated.  The number 2 cylinder intake 
and exhaust push rods were bent, which restricted the movement of the rocker arms.
With the exception of the number 1 cylinder, the top and bottom spark plugs of all remaining 
cylinder heads were removed; their electrodes were intact and dark gray in color.  When the 
left magneto was removed from the engine case and rotated by hand, it produced spark from 
all leads.  The right magneto was found separated from the engine.
Fuel was present at the fuel distributor, injector screen, and the engine driven fuel pump. The 
fuel servo filter screen was absent of debris.  All five remaining fuel injector nozzles were 
removed, and were absent of debris.
Oil was present throughout the engine, and no metal contamination was observed in the oil or 
oil filter.  The oil pump assembly was intact, and no damage was noted.  The oil sump screen 
was removed from the engine and was absent of debris.  
Internal examination of each remaining cylinder was conducted using a lighted borescope.  No 
abnormalities were observed to the valves, top surfaces of each piston, or the cylinder walls.
The vacuum pump was removed from the engine.  When rotated, suction from the inlet and 
outlet lines was observed.  Disassembly of the pump did not reveal any abnormalities.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Department of Health, Office of the Chief Medical 
Examiner, Boston, Massachusetts, performed an autopsy on the pilot, on June 2, 2004.
The FAA Toxicology and Accident Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma conducted 
toxicological testing on the pilot.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
