Location:
Dunsmuir, CA
Accident Number:
LAX04CA236
Date & Time:
06/02/2004, 1300 PDT 
Registration:
N39678
Aircraft:
Piper PA-28-181
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot landed, overran the 2,700-foot runway, and impacted a berm off the departure end of 
the runway.  The pilot was conducting a cross-country flight and mistook the accident airport 
for her destination airport, which is nearby and has a 5,000 foot-long runway.  She landed and 
could not stop the airplane prior to the runway's termination.  Review of the airplane's landing 
performance chart revealed that if the pilot landed the airplane at maximum gross weight with 
full flaps extended, it should have stopped at the 1,100-foot mark.  The pilot landed with the 
flaps retracted.  The pilot reported that there were no anomalies with the airplane or engine.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's misjudgment of speed and distance, which resulted in an overrun of the runway.  
The pilot's failure to use flaps and his landing at an airport with a runway shorter than he 
expected is a contributing factor.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
