Analysis   
The airplane collided with the terrain following a loss of control during a go-around.  The 
student reported he maintained an airspeed of 70 miles per hour with 20 degrees of flaps until 
he began the landing flare.  He stated the airplane ballooned and drifted "slightly right" during 
the flare.  He applied left aileron in an attempt to realign the airplane, but it veered to the left.  
He stated he then added full power at which time the airplane banked to the left.  The left wing 
contacted the ground and the airplane cart wheeled, slid across a taxiway, and came to rest 
alongside a ditch.  The student pilot stated he made 5 takeoffs and landing with his flight 
instructor on the morning of the accident.  The accident occurred on the first solo landing of 
the day.  The accident occurred on the student's second supervised solo flight.  He reported 
having .5 hours of pilot in command flight time prior to this flight.
Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
