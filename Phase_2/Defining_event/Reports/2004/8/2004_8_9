Factual Information
On August 1, 2004, about 1030 Pacific daylight time, an experimental Paulick Wittman W-10, 
N70P, registered to and flown by the pilot as a 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight, collided with 
trees shortly after takeoff from Whidbey Air Park, Langley, Washington.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for the local flight.  The aircraft 
was destroyed by impact damage and post-crash fire.  The private pilot, the sole occupant, was 
fatally injured.
A witness reported that shortly after the aircraft took off from runway 16, the aircraft did not 
attain an altitude sufficient to clear trees.  After the impact, a post-crash fire consumed the 
wreckage.
The pilot's flight logbook was not located for review.  The Federal Aviation Administration Aero 
Medical Division reported that the pilot's last medical certificate, a Class III, was issued on 
February 3, 1999.  At this time, the pilot reported a total flight time of 4,000 hours.
The wreckage was removed from the accident site and transported to the pilot's hangar at the 
airpark.  Inspectors from the Seattle, Washington, Federal Aviation Administration Flight 
Standards District Office, reported that the engine displayed severe heat distress and impact 
damage.  The crankcase was distorted, however, all connecting rods appeared to be connected 
to the crankshaft.  The crankshaft would not turn.  The oil pan was melted away.   Both 
magnetos were heat distressed and their function could not be determined.  The carburetor 
was destroyed.  The fuel strainer and oil filter adapter assembly were intact, however, the lines 
to both were destroyed.
Control continuity to the elevator control system was established, however, damaged and heat 
distressed.  The fuselage structure was heat distressed and the fabric covering was burned 
away.
Maintenance logbooks were not located for review.
The Island County Coroner's Office, Coupeville, Washington, conducted an autopsy.  Dr. 
Andrea R. Capiola, Island County Deputy Coroner, reported that pilot's cause of death as: 
"Thermal burns"  The coroner's report indicated an interview with the pilot's wife.  During the 
interview, the Coroner learned that the pilot had experienced "a minor heart attack" about a 
year ago, but that since, the pilot was "in excellent health and was very lively."  The pilot's wife 
reported that on the morning of the accident, he indicated to her that he was not planning on 
flying that day.  The wife also indicated that the pilot was planning on selling the aircraft that 
was involved in the accident.
Toxicological samples were sent to the Federal Aviation Administration Civil Aeromedical 
Institute, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for analysis.  The results of the analysis were positive for 
Metoprolol detected in blood and present in urine.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
