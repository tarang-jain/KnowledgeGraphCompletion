Factual Information
On March 2, 2004, approximately 1730 central standard time, a Piper PA-38-112 single-engine 
airplane, N2588A, was substantially damaged when it impacted a barbed-wire fence following 
a precautionary landing near Sugar Land, Texas.  The passenger received minor injuries and 
the private pilot was not injured.  The aircraft was owned by King Interests Inc., of Pearland, 
Texas, and operated by King Flight Service of Pearland, Texas.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed for the Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.  The 
aircraft departed Victoria Regional Airport (VCT), near Victoria, Texas, at 1600, with a 
destination of Pearland Regional Airport (LVJ), near Houston, Texas.  No flight plan was filed 
for the flight.
According to the Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB Form 6120.1/2), the 170-hour 
pilot reported that he did not receive a weather briefieng for the flight; however, he did obtain 
some weather data from the internet on DUATS.  The pilot added that while en route, the 
weather deteriorated and he elected to divert to Houston Southwest Airport (AXH), near 
Houston, Texas.  The pilot added that the weather continued to deteriorate, and he was forced 
to attempt a precautionary landing in a field.  During the landing roll, the aircraft struck a 
barbed-wire fence and came to rest in the inverted position.
Examination of the aircraft by the FAA inspector, who responded to the accident site, revealed 
structural damage to the right wing spar, the horizontal stabilizer, and fuselage.
The automated surface observing system at Houston Southwest Airport (SGR) at 1753 reported 
the winds at 130 degrees at 11 knots, 7 statute miles visibility, overcast at 1,100 feet msl, 
temperature 22 degrees Celsius, dew point 20 degrees Celsius, and a barometric pressure 
reading of 29.99 inches of Mercury.
The automated surface observing system at Victoria Regional Airport (VCT) at 1751 reported 
the winds at 140 at 10 knots, 9 statute miles visibility, broken at 1,300 feet msl, temperature 22 
degrees Celsius, dew point 21 degrees Celsius, and a barometric pressure reading of 29.96 
inches of Mercury.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
