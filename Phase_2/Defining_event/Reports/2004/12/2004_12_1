Substantial

Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The airplane impacted a muddy field during a forced landing due to a total loss of engine power 
about 1 1/2 hours after departure.  The pilot stated that he performed a preflight inspection of 
the airplane in a hanger equipped with fluorescent lighting.  He stated that he checked the fuel 
gauges, visually checked the fuel level in each tank, and that the fuel level in each fuel tank was 
"just under the tabs."  Postaccident inspection of the airplane revealed that the fuel selector 
was positioned to the left fuel tank and no usable fuel was noted in either fuel tank.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The inadequate in-flight planning/decision which resulted in fuel exhaustion and the loss of 
engine power.  Contributing factors were the muddy terrain and the vegetation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
