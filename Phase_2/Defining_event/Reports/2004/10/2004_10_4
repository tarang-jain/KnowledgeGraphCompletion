Registration:
N2849Z
Aircraft:
Piper PA-22/20
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:

1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot was practicing touch-and-go landings in crosswind conditions, and during his first 
landing there was a 40 degree crosswind at five knots. As he was cleared for his second landing, 
the tower advised him that the wind had changed direction and speed, and he was therefore 
landing in a 60 degree crosswind of seven knots. During his second landing, he relaxed his 
"cross control input" too much during the landing flare, and the aircraft's left wing began to lift. 
He therefore elected to execute a go-around, but as he added power the aircraft began rotating 
to the left. He therefore elected to try to put the aircraft back onto the runway, but as it touched 
down, the aircraft was not aligned with the runway, and it therefore quickly veered to the left. 
As the aircraft departed the side of the runway, the tip of its right wing came in contact with the 
terrain resulting in substantial damage to the wings internal structure. According to the pilot, 
there was nothing wrong with the aircraft, and the accident was simply a result of his failure to 
adequately control the aircraft in the crosswind conditions.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate compensation for crosswind conditions during landing, resulting in his 
failure to maintain directional control. Factors include the presence of crosswinds.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
