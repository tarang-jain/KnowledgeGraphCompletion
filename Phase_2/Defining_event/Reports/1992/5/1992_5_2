Analysis 
 TWO FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS WERE ABOARD.  ACCORDING TO THE AIRPLANE 
OPERATOR, THE PURPOSE OF THE FLIGHT WAS TO CONDUCT A BIENNIAL FLIGHT 
REVIEW.  A SHORT FIELD LANDING WAS ATTEMPTED ON A 2100 FOOT LONG GRASS 
STRIP.  A LANDING WAS MADE AT AN APPROACH SPEED OF 70 MPH, USING FULL 
FLAPS.  DURING THE LANDING, A DECISION WAS MADE TO ABORT THE LANDING 
BECAUSE THE AIRPLANE WAS NOT ADEQUATELY DECELERATING AND INSUFFICIENT 
RUNWAY LENGTH REMAINED. ENGINE POWER WAS INCREASED TO ABORT THE 
LANDING, AND THE AIRPLANE SUBSEQUENTLY COLLIDED WITH AN EMBANKMENT 
ABOUT 350 FEET PAST THE END OF THE RUNWAY.  A WITNESS REPORTED THE 
AIRPLANE LANDED ABOUT HALFWAY DOWN THE RUNWAY.  POST ACCIDENT 
EXAMINATION OF THE AIRPLANE DID NOT DISCLOSE EVIDENCE OF MECHANICAL 
MALFUNCTION. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE PILOT'S MISJUDGEMENT OF DISTANCE AND ALTITUDE THAT RESULTED IN AN 
LANDING OVERRUN AND COLLISION WITH AN EMBANKMENT.  CONTRIBUTING WAS 
FAILURE TO INITIATE A GO AROUND AND INADEQUATE SUPERVISION.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
