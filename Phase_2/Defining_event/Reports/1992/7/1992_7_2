Analysis 
 THE HOMEBUILT ACCIDENT AIRPLANE LOST ENGINE POWER DURING INITIAL 
CLIMB FROM TAKEOFF.  IT COLLIDED WITH TREES AND TERRAIN DURING A FORCED 
LANDING. THE PILOT DESCRIBED HOW HE HAD BEEN FLYING ABOUT 45 MINUTES 
AND HAD DONE TWO LANDINGS AND TAKEOFFS.  DURING THE THIRD TAKEOFF THE 
AIRPLANE HAD CLIMBED ABOUT 75 TO 100 FEET WHEN THE ENGINE LOST POWER. 
EXAMINATION OF THE CARBURETOR AIR BOX REVEALED A FLAPPER VALVE IN THE 
AIR BOX HAD BROKEN. THE VALVE PLATE WAS FREE TO MOVE ABOUT IN THE SPACE 
BETWEEN THE SHAFT AND THE CARBURETOR AIR INTAKE.  THE PLATE HAD BEEN 
SECURED TO THE SHAFT WITH TWO SPOT WELDS.  THE SURFACE OF THE BROKEN 
WELDS APPEARED DULL EXCEPT FOR A SMALL PORTION ON ONE WELD WHERE THE 
BREAK APPEARED SHINY.  THE CARBURETOR AIR BOX HAD BEEN PURCHASED FROM 
AN AIRCRAFT SALVAGE OPERATOR FOR INSTALLATION ON THE AIRPLANE.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
