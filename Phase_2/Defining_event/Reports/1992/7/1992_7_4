Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
MAYER, AZ
Accident Number:
LAX92LA273
Date & Time:
07/01/1992, 0900 MST 
Registration:
N9455G
Aircraft:
CESSNA U206E
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
4 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
 THE ENGINE QUIT WITH A LOUD BANG ABOUT 15 MINUTES INTO THE CROSS 
COUNTRY FLIGHT. THE AIRCRAFT WAS OVER MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN AND THE 
PILOT ATTEMPTED TO LAND IN A SMALL PASTURE. THE AIRCRAFT ENCOUNTERED 
ROUGH TERRAIN DURING THE LANDING ROLL OUT AND NOSED OVER. 
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE NUMBER 2 MAIN BEARING HAD SPUN, 
CLOSING OFF THE INTERNAL OIL PASSAGE IN THE CRANKSHAFT AND JOURNAL. THE 
ENGINE SUSTAINED A RESULTING OIL STARVATION FAILURE OF THE NUMBER 2 AND 
3 CONNECTING RODS. REVIEW OF THE MAINTENANCE RECORDS ESTABLISHED THAT 
A MAINTENANCE FACILITY HAD FOUND A LARGE AMOUNT OF METAL PARTICLES IN 
THE OIL 40 HOURS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. THE MAINTENANCE FACILITY WARNED 
THE PILOT ABOUT THE EXCESSIVE INTERNAL ENGINE WEAR, RECOMMENDING 
'FURTHER INSPECTION PRIOR TO FLIGHT.' NO CORRECTIVE ACTION ENTRIES WERE 
NOTED IN THE LOGBOOK. THE ENGINE WAS FOUND TO HAVE ACCRUED 1,520 HOURS 
SINCE OVERHAUL. THE MANUFACTURER RECOMMENDS A TIME BETWEEN 
OVERHAUL INTERVAL OF 1,700 HOURS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE FAILURE OF THE ENGINE DUE TO THE SLIPPAGE OF THE NUMBER 2 MAIN 
BEARING AND THE RESULTANT OIL STARVATION FAILURE OF THE NUMBER 2 
CONNECTING ROD. THE NUMBER 2 MAIN BEARING SLIPPAGE WAS CAUSED BY THE 
FAILURE OF THE PILOT/OWNER TO OVERHAUL THE ENGINE IN A TIMELY FASHION 
WHEN INTERNAL WEAR PATTERNS INDICATED THAT A POTENTIAL BEARING 
PROBLEM EXISTED.  A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT WAS THE UNSUITABLE NATURE OF 
THE TERRAIN FOR A FORCED LANDING.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
