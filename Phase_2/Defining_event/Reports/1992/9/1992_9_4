Analysis 
 THE PILOT COMPLETED A PREFLIGHT INSPECTION WHICH INCLUDED CHECKING  
FUEL SAMPLES FOR CONTAMINATES; NO CONTAMINATES WERE REPORTED. THE 
PILOT LOADED THE CHEMICALS ON THE AIRPLANE, FLEW 15 MINUTES TO THE 
SOYBEAN FIELD AND STARTED THE SPRAYING OPERATION. AFTER SPAYING ABOUT 
100 GALLONS, THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH TREES SURROUNDING THE FIELD. 
THE PILOT DID NOT RECALL THE EVENTS OF THE ACCIDENT, NOR WERE THERE 
WITNESSES TO THE ACCIDENT. HOWEVER, TWO PEOPLE NEAR THE ACCIDENT SITE, 
RECALLED DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF THE ENGINE OPERATION PRIOR TO THE 
COLLISION. AN EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF WATER 
IN THE FUEL MANIFOLD VALVE AND NUMBER 6 CYLINDER; IMPACT FORCES 
DAMAGED THE FUEL TANKS. THE ENGINE OPERATED NORMALLY DURING THE POST-
CRASH EXAMINATION. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
