Analysis 
THE PILOT LOADED THE 2 PASSENGERS AND GEAR IN THE AIRPLANE TO THE 
EXTENT THAT IT TOOK SUCCESSIVE ATTEMPTS TO CLOSE THE DOOR DUE TO THE 
GEAR WHICH 'FILLED UP THE AIRPLANE TO THE ROOF.' THE REAR PAX HAD TO LAY 
ON TOP OF MEAT AND CAMP SUPPLIES WITH 2 DOGS IN HIS LAP. THE AIRPLANE WAS 
ESTIMATED TO BE 772 LBS OVER MAX GROSS WEIGHT AT TAKEOFF. AFTER TAKEOFF 
THE AIRPLANE CLIMBED SLOWLY FOR APRX 55 MIN AT TAKEOFF POWER. A 
'SLEDGEHAMMER' SOUND PRECEDED THE APPEARANCE OF OIL FLOWING INTO THE 
CABIN AREA. NO REDUCTION OF POWER WAS OBSERVED. THE OIL PRESSURE BEGAN 
DROPPING RAPIDLY, AND THE PILOT MADE A PRECAUTIONARY LANDING ON A 
BEACH. THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER IN GRASS. ENGINE TEARDOWN EXAMINATION 
REVEALED THAT THE #6 CYLINDER HAD FAILED THROUGH THE HEAD-TO-BARREL 
THREADED JOINT. METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT THE FAILURE 
WAS THE RESULT OF FATIGUE CRACKING IN THE CYLINDER HEAD CASTING. THIS 
TYPE OF FAILURE OCCURS WHEN THE CYLINDER IS OPERATED AT ELEVATED 
TEMPERATURES (ABOVE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE) FOR A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF 
TIME. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
FATIGUE FAILURE OF AN ENGINE CYLINDER PRECIPITATED BY THE PILOT-IN-
COMMAND INTENTIONALLY EXCEEDING THE ENGINE PERFORMANCE RATINGS IN 
ORDER TO SUSTAIN FLIGHT IN THE GROSSLY OVERWEIGHT CONDITION. A FACTOR 
CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE HIGH GRASS. A FACTOR CONTRIBUTING 
TO THE SEVERITY OF THE PASSENGER'S INJURY WAS THE UNSECURED CARGO.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
