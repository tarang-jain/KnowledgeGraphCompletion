Analysis 
 THE STUDENT PILOT HAD BEEN PLANNING TO TAKE HIS LONG SOLO CROSS 
COUNTRY FLIGHT FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS.  ON THE ACCIDENT DATE THE STUDENT 
OBTAINED A COMPUTER WEATHER BRIEFING.  THE WEATHER FOR THE ROUTE OF 
FLIGHT WAS FORECASTED TO HAVE A CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS.  WEATHER AT 
THE DEPARTURE AIRPORT WAS LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS DURING THE TIME OF THE 
BRIEFING AND PREDEPARTURE DISCUSSION THE STUDENT HAD WITH HIS 
INSTRUCTOR.  THE STUDENT DEPARTED ON THE SOLO CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT 
DURING VERY LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS. APPROXIMATELY 8 TO 10 MINUTES AFTER 
THE STUDENT DEPARTED ON HIS FLIGHT, THE INSTRUCTOR CALLED HIM ON THE 
RADIO.  THE INSTRUCTOR ASKED THE STUDENT HOW THE WEATHER WAS.  THE 
STUDENT REPLIED THE VISIBILITY WAS THREE MILES. SHORTLY AFTER THIS 
CONVERSATION THE STUDENT CALLED THE AIRPORT AND STATED HE WAS LOST 
AND HAVING DIFFICULTY. THE AIRPORT MANAGER, A NON-PILOT, TOLD THE 
STUDENT TO MAKE A 180 DEGREE TURN AND RETURN TO THE AIRPORT.  A GROUND 
WITNESS STATED HE HEARD AN AIRPLANE FLY OVER HEAD TWO TIMES DURING 
VERY HEAVY SNOW SHOWERS.  DURING THE SECOND PASS THE WITNESS STATED HE 
HEARD A VACILLATING ENGINE SOUND AND A LOUD CRASH SOUND.  THE 
WRECKAGE WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES AFTER THE WITNESS 
HEARD THE ENGINE SOUNDS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 SPATIAL DISORIENTATION AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF 
THE AIRPLANE.  FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACCIDENT WERE THE SNOW 
CONDITIONS, AN INADEQUATE WEATHER EVALUATION BY BOTH THE STUDENT AND 
INSTRUCTOR, OVER CONFIDENCE IN PERSONAL ABILITY, INADEQUATE REMEDIAL 
ACTION, VFR FLIGHT INTO IMC CONDITIONS, AND LACK OF TOTAL EXPERIENCE ON 
BEHALF OF THE PILOT.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
