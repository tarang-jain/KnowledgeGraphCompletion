Location:
GABRIELS, NY
Accident Number:
DCA92MA016
Date & Time:
01/03/1992, 0546 EST 
Registration:
N55000
Aircraft:
BEECH 1900C
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Fatal, 2 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Scheduled
Analysis 
ON IFR ARRIVAL, FLT 4821 WAS CLEARED TO INTERSECTION 17 NE OF AIRPORT AT 
6000', THEN FOR ILS RUNWAY 23 APPROACH. RADAR SERVICE WAS TERMINATED 6.5 
EAST OF INTERSECTION.  RADAR DATA SHOWED THAT FLIGHT CROSSED & THEN 
BRACKETED LOCALIZER. FLIGHT INTERCEPTED GLIDE SLOPE FROM BELOW ABOUT 7 
MI OUTSIDE OF OUTER MARKER & THENCE DEVIATED ABOVE GLIDE SLOPE. ABOUT 2 
MILES OUTSIDE OF MARKER, FLIGHT WAS AT A FULL FLY DOWN DEFLECTION WHEN 
IT ENTERED A DESCENT VARYING FROM 1200 TO 2000 FPM. AIRCRAFT STRUCK 
WOODED MOUNTAIN TOP 2.0 MI INSIDE OF OUTER MARKER (3.9 MI FROM RWY) AT 
ELEVATION OF 2280'. MINIMUM ALTITUDE AT MARKER WAS 3600'. GLIDE SLOPE 
ELEVATION AT POINT OF IMPACT WAS APRX 2900'. EVIDENCE WAS FOUND OF 
INADEQUATE ELECTRICAL GROUND PATH BETWEEN RADOME & FUSELAGE WHICH, 
WHEN COMBINED WITH EXISTING WEATHER CONDITIONS, MAY HAVE PRODUCED 
ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (PRECIPITATION STATIC). ALTHOUGH POST-ACCIDENT 
TESTS WERE NOT CONCLUSIVE, THE SAFETY BOARD BELIEVES THAT THE GLIDE 
SLOPE INDICATIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNRELIABLE DUE TO PRECIPITATION 
STATIC INTERFERENCE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
FAILURE OF THE CAPTAIN TO ESTABLISH A STABILIZED APPROACH, HIS 
INADEQUATE CROSS-CHECK OF INSTRUMENTS, HIS DESCENT BELOW SPECIFIED 
MINIMUM ALTITUDE AT THE FINAL APPROACH FIX, AND FAILURE OF THE COPILOT 
TO MONITOR THE APPROACH.  FACTORS RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: 
WEATHER CONDITIONS AND POSSIBLE PRECIPITATION STATIC INTERFERENCE, 
CAUSED BY INADEQUATE GROUNDING BETWEEN THE RADOME AND FUSELAGE 
THAT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN UNRELIABLE GLIDE SLOPE INDICATIONS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
