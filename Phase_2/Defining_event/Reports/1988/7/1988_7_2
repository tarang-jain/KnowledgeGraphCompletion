Analysis 
THE PLT REPORTED THAT THE ENGINE BEGAN TO RUN ROUGH & LOSE POWER AS 
THE AIRPLANE CLIMBED THROUGH 9,000 FT MSL. SHE THEN SWITCHED FUEL 
TANKS AND MOVED THE MIXTURE TO FULL RICH, BUT THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO 
LOSE POWER. CARB HEAT WAS NOT USED AT ANY TIME. A FORCED LDG WAS 
SUBSEQUENTLY MADE IN A FIELD WHERE THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH A UTILITY 
POLE AND A DITCH. POST-CRASH EXAM OF THE ENGINE REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF 
PREEXISTING MECHANICAL FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION. EXAMINATION OF AN 
ICING PROBABILITY CHART REVEALED THAT THE REPORTED WX CONDITIONS IN 
THE AREA WERE FAVORABLE FOR THE FORMATION OF MODERATE CARBURETOR 
ICING AT CRUISE POWER. THE CESSNA 172M OWNER'S MANUAL NOTES THAT A 
GRADUAL LOSS IN RPM AND EVENTUAL ENGINE ROUGHNESS MAY RESULT FROM 
THE FORMATION OF CARB ICE, AND PRESCRIBES THE USE OF CARB HEAT TO CLEAR 
THE ICE.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
