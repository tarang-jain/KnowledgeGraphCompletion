Accident Number:
WPR14CA110
Date & Time:
02/01/2014, 0818 MST 
Registration:
N31TC
Aircraft:

Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that the wind was calm during his descent to landing. He further stated that 
he was low and slow at about 150 to 200 feet above the ground when the airplane began to stall 
and he was too late to respond. The airplane subsequently collided with terrain and came to 
rest short of the runway threshold. During the accident sequence, the firewall and both wings 
sustained substantial damage. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or 
failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate glide path and failure to maintain adequate airspeed during final 
approach, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
Findings
Aircraft
Airspeed - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Descent/approach/glide path - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
