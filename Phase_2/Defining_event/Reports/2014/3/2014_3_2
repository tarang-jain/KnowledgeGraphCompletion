Analysis   
According to the pilot, he was regaining his 90-day passenger-carrying privileges since his 
most recent flight was about 5 months prior to the accident. He had performed one landing 
successfully, and on the second landing, the airplane touched down on all three wheels and was 
decelerating. The airplane subsequently veered to the left, departed the left side of the runway, 
struck a snowbank, and came to rest resulting in substantial damage to the wing strut, firewall, 
and fuselage. The pilot reported to a Federal Aviation Administration inspector that the wind 
was from the left at 5 to 10 knots and occasionally was gusting to 15 knots. He also reported 
that there were no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies with the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of directional control during the landing rollout in crosswinds, resulting in a 
runway excursion and subsequent impact with a snow bank.
Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
