Analysis   
On January 3, 2014, at approximately 1930 pacific standard time, Southwest Airlines flight 
2516, a Boeing 737-800, N8327A, experienced a tail strike during landing at McCarran 
International Airport (KLAS), Las Vegas, Nevada. There were no injuries to the 180 passengers 
and crew onboard and the airplane was substantially damaged. The flight was operating as a 
regularly scheduled passenger flight and originated from Orlando International Airport 
(KMCO), Orlando, Florida. 
According to the operator, the captain was the pilot flying and the first officer (FO) was the 
pilot monitoring. The accident flight was the first and only scheduled flight for the day for both 
crew members. Both pilots indicated that takeoff through the initial descent was uneventful. 
The aircraft was configured for a flaps 30 landing. During the ILS approach to runway 25L, the 
captain used the Heads-up Guidance System (HGS) in the IMC mode. 
During the decent below 100 feet, the FO indicated that the runway environment was dark and 
sensed the runway was "coming close fast". He noted a slightly increased descent rate and 
before he could make a callout, the captain had begun to take corrective action. 
During the descent, the captain stated he was hand flying the airplane (autopilot and 
autothrottles were off) and used the localizer, glideslope and flare cues from the HGS. At 
approximately 30 feet, he transitioned from the HGS to the runway environment, noting it 
appeared "pitch black." He then noticed the runway edge lights and what appeared to be an 
increased sink rate.
Both pilots indicated the airplane touched down firm, then bounced, and the second touch 
down was harder than the first. Neither were aware that they had struck the tail. The captain 
did not recall seeing a tail strike warning indication from the HGS.
Post flight inspection revealed that the tail strike indicator was compressed and deep scrapes 
and wear damage to the lower aft fuselage skin. Further investigation revealed multiple 
fractured frames and buckled stringers, shear ties and straps.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=88654
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
