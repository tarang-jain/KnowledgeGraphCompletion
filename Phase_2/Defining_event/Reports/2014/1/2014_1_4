Analysis   
On January 2, 2014, about 1700 central standard time, a Bell 206B helicopter, N400XL, 
experienced a roll over while repositioning from the ramp to a mobile helipad. The pilot was 
not injured. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Engemann Aviation Services, 
LLC under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which originated from Draughon-Miller 
Central Texas Regional Airport (KTPL) in Temple, Texas.
The pilot reported he was relocating the helicopter from the parking ramp to a mobile helipad 
approximately 30 feet away. As the pilot lowered the helicopter onto the mobile helipad, the 
left rear skid slipped off the pad. The helicopter rolled over and impacted the ground on its 
right side. The rollover resulted in substantial damage to the main rotor head, including 
separation of the rotor blades, and separation of the tail boom.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
