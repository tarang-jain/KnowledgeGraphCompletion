Location:
Geneseo, IL
Accident Number:
CEN14CA365
Date & Time:
07/02/2014,  CDT 
Registration:
N2209G
Aircraft:
CESSNA 182A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Skydiving
Analysis   
The pilot was on final approach when the engine started to run out of fuel. She said her boss 
had a similar problem on a previous flight, and had to correct for it by pitching the nose up and 
down to force fuel into the fuel lines. The pilot recalled pitching the nose up and down but 
nothing after that. A witness, who saw the airplane pitching up and down several times before 
it impacted the ground, responded to the crash. He noted that the fuel selector was set to the 
"both" position and no fuel was leaking from either fuel tank's gas cap. When the airplane was 
righted, the witness said he saw several gallons of fuel drain from the left tank but not the right 
tank. When he visually checked the right fuel tank, it was empty. The left tank had about 9 
gallons (about 6.5 gallons usable) still in the tank. A postaccident examination of the airplane 
by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed the airplane sustained substantial 
damage to the firewall, forward engine mounts, right wing and vertical stabilizer and rudder. 
About 6 gallons of fuel was drained from the left wing tank and the right tank was empty. A 
review of the terrain where the airplane impacted the ground revealed the vegetation around 
the left tank was discolored from fuel, but the area around the right tank was not. No pre 
mishap mechanical discrepancies were noted with the engine or airplane that would have 
precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's mismanagement of the available fuel supply, which resulted in a loss of engine 
power due to fuel exhaustion.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
