Analysis   
The pilot reported he landed at the airport without incident. During engine shutdown, he 
applied rotor brake to slow the main rotor blades. When the pilot released the brake, he heard 
a bang and felt an impact to the aircraft on the rear left side. He reapplied the main rotor brake 
intermittently until the blades stopped. The pilot exited the aircraft and noticed a tail boom 
strike occurred. He stated he input aft cyclic during landing to accommodate landing slightly 
downhill and did not place the controls in neutral during shutdown. According to the 
manufacture's shutdown procedures, the cyclic and pedals should be in the neutral position.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
