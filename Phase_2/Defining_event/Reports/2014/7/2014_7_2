Analysis 
The commercial pilot reported that, after conducting a personal flight and during the approach 
for landing, he attempted to lower the landing gear but that the left main landing gear did not 
extend. The pilot repeatedly attempted to lower the landing gear without success. He then 
chose to land the airplane with the landing gear retracted. 
Examination of the airplane revealed that the left main landing gear retract rod was fractured 
and buckled. Examination of the remaining landing gear components revealed no anomalies. 
Probable Cause and Findings

Factual Information
On July 1, 2014, about 1455 central daylight time, a Beech A36 airplane, N136EL, sustained 
substantial damage during and intentional wheels-up landing to runway 12L at the San 
Antonio International Airport (SAT). The pilot and 3 passengers were not injured. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. The aircraft was registered to Angel Brothers 
Aviation Ltd., and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 91 as personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which 
operated on a visual flight rules flight plan. The flight originated from Baytown Airport (HPY), 
Baytown, Texas, at an unconfirmed time. 
In a telephone interview with the pilot, he stated that upon extending the landing gear he did 
not get a gear-down indication for the left main landing gear. He stated that the right and nose 
landing gear lights indicated extended. The pilot made several unsuccessful attempts to extend 
the landing gear. He had advised the SAT air traffic controller of the problem and elected to 
land the airplane with the landing gear in the retracted position. 
Examination of the airplane revealed that the left main landing gear retract rod had fractured 
and buckled near the landing gear extension motor. Examination of the retract rod confirmed 
that the rod eye at the end that attached to the gear motor had fractured. The bearing remained 
attached to the gear motor arm. The retract rod was constructed from a steel tube with a link 
fabricated at the end that attached to the motor. The link was composed of two formed steel 
plates riveted together and welded to the end of the tube. The fabricated link was bent about 90 
degrees in two places. The first bend was through the eye that held the bearing, and the second 
bend was about five inches farther outboard. The bends were in opposite directions forming a 
"Z" shape. Two of the three rivets that connected the link plates together were not found. The 
third rivet, the farthest outboard, was intact. The steel tube was bent about 5 degrees, 20 
inches from the inboard end. Examination of the remainder of the landing gear components 
revealed no anomalies. The only preimpact damage that was evident was the damage to the 
landing gear retract rod.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
