10/01/2006, 0830 CDT 
Registration:
N5950X
Aircraft:
Brantly Helicopter B-2
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
According to the pilot, during the attempted takeoff, he raised the collective and the helicopter 
"became light on its skids."  The pilot verified the wind conditions based on his observation 
with nearby trees.  The wind was observed to be "light" and from the south-southwest 
direction.  The pilot initiated a turn into the direction of the wind, and prior to transitional lift, 
the rotor RPM dropped.  The pilot attempted to recover the drop in rotor RPM by lowering the 
collective.  The helicopter skids touched the terrain, and the helicopter rolled over on it's right 
side.  The pilot stated, "I believe I got a wind gust that contributed to the low [rotor] RPM."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control during takeoff.  A contributing factor was the low 
rotor RPM.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
