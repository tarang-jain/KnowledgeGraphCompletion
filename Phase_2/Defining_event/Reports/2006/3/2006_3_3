Analysis   
After landing, the pilot taxied to his hangar that he shares with an aviation maintenance 
technician with inspector's authorization.  As he taxied around a corner, he saw his car out of 
the hangar and another airplane in the hangar.  He knew where this other airplane was 
normally tied down so he turned his airplane 180 degrees and transitioned to the tie-down 
area, which was located near an airport fence.  The pilot was watching for chocks and tie-down 
straps on the ground while maintaining clearance between the right wing tip and the fence 
when the left wing impacted a light pole.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to maintain an adequate clearance with obstructions while taxiing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
