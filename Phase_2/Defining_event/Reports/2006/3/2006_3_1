Factual Information
On March 1, 2006, about 1800 Alaska standard time, a Douglas DC-3 airplane, N777YA, 
sustained substantial damage during an in-flight collision with trees on final approach to the 
Beluga Airport, Beluga, Alaska.  The airplane was being operated by Transnorthern Aviation 
Inc., Anchorage, Alaska, as a visual flight rules (VFR) non-scheduled cargo flight under Title 
14, CFR Part 135, when the accident occurred.  The airline transport certificated pilot, and the 
first officer were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and company VFR 
flight following procedures were in effect.  The flight departed the Ted Stevens Anchorage 
International Airport, Anchorage, about 1700. 
During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
investigator-in-charge (IIC) on March 3, an FAA principal operations inspector said he had 
found an airplane with extensive left wing leading edge damage at the Ted Stevens Anchorage 
International Airport.  He said the operator told him the damage occurred while the pilot was 
landing at the Beluga Airport, on March 1. 
During a telephone conversation with the NTSB IIC on March 3, a representative of the 
operator said the pilot reported striking trees at the approach end of the runway during 
landing.  She said the airplane landed without incident, and the pilot subsequently flew the 
airplane to Anchorage.
In a written statement to the NTSB dated March 2, the pilot confirmed that the airplane struck 
treetops on final approach to the Beluga Airport, but landed safely.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
