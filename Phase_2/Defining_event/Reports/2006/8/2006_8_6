Analysis   
According to the pilot, he landed to the north on the 4,100-foot-long turf airstrip and had 
slowed the airplane to about 25 mph when it "went to the right of centerline."  He attempted to 
regain directional control by using left rudder and brake, but was unable to prevent the 
airplane from ground looping.  The pilot commented that he "should have been faster on the 
rudder pedals to not let it get away."

The pilot's failure to maintain directional control, which resulted in a ground loop during the

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
