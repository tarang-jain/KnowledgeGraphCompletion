Analysis   
The pilot stated that during his return flight the tail rotor chip detector light flickered and then 
came on and stayed on. He said he was familiar with the flight area and knew there was a fire 
department near his intended landing site. He elected to perform a precautionary landing near 
the fire department to inspect the helicopter. During the landing he failed to observe a TV 
transmission line, struck the line, nosed down from about 5-feet AGL, rolled to the left and 
impacted the ground. The pilot further stated that he was "impacted by a strong lateral wind 
gust from the east which swung the tail rotor into the low hanging cable. However, the nearest 
weather reporting facility did not report wind gusts at the time of the accident. The pilot also 
stated that there was "not a mechanical malfunction".
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate visual lookout during a precautionary landing which resulted in an in-
flight collision with a transmission wire.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
