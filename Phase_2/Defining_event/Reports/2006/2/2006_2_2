Location:
Rome, GA
Accident Number:
ATL06CA042
Date & Time:
02/01/2006, 1715 EST 
Registration:
N2134U
Aircraft:
Cessna T210N
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot stated that while in cruise flight she looked at the fuel gauges and the right fuel tank 
was empty and the left fuel tank was approximately a quarter full. The primer was stuck in the 
out position. She and the passenger attempted to push the primer in with negative results. She 
then decided to fly back towards the departure airport and while en-route, the engine lost 
power. The pilot stated that the airplane was approximately 1000 feet above the ground and 
she elected not to attempt an engine restart. She made a 180 degree turn and initiated a forced 
landing to an open field. The airplane landed half way down the field. She attempted to stop 
the airplane, but the airplane skidded through a barb wire fence, the left wing clipped a tree, 
and the airplane spun around 180-degrees. The airplane came to rest facing north. 
Examination of the airplane found the airplane contained no usable fuel and the primer handle 
was unlocked. A review of the primer's design drawings found that there are two check valves 
within the primers system which prevent fuel from entering the engine even with the primer in 
the out position. Fuel can only enter the engine through the action of closing the primer.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper fuel management resulting in a total loss of engine power due to fuel 
exhaustion.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
