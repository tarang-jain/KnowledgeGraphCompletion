Aircraft:

Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The airplane veered off the runway and nosed over.  Prior to departure the pilot obtained a full 
weather briefing, but there was no information regarding the surface winds at his destination 
airport.  The pilot stated that the approach was normal, despite the crosswind conditions.  Just 
prior to touchdown a strong gust blew the airplane to the left side of the runway.  He attempted 
to execute a go-around by adding full power, but the airplane was unable to get airborne due to 
the strong wind conditions.  The airplane touched down off the runway surface and nosed over, 
coming to rest inverted.  The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures 
with the airplane.  He estimated the winds were from the north at 25 knots gusting to 40 knots.  
The airport manager confirmed the existence of strong gusty wind conditions at the time of the 
accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's inadequate compensation for the gusty crosswind conditions and failure to maintain 
directional control.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
