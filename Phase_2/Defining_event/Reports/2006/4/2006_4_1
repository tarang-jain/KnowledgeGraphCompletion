Analysis 
The helicopter was observed by witnesses descending and flying east bound over County Road 
222 in the vicinity of Whitlockâ„¢s General Store between 30 to 200 feet above the ground. One 
witness thought the pilot was following a creek in preparation for landing at a private helipad 
where a mechanic is known to perform maintenance on helicopters. A change in engine noise 
was heard as the helicopter collided with telephone lines, the nose pitched down, the helicopter 
collided with the ground near a highway guardrail, rolled over on its right side, and a post 
crash fire ensued. Examination of the airframe, flight controls, main rotor system, tail rotor 
system, and engine assembly and accessories revealed no anomalies. The pilot stated to his 
brother he has no recollection of the events concerning the flight. Review of records revealed 
the pilot had flown the helicopter 4.1 hours in the last year.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain a visual look out while maneuvering resulting in an in-flight 
collision with wires and the ground. A factor in the accident was the pilot's lack of recent 
experience in rotorcraft operations.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On April 1, 2006, at 1802 central standard time, a Brantly B2B, N2183U, registered to a private 
owner, operating as a 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight, collided with telephone and guy wires 
while maneuvering in the vicinity of Cullman, Alabama. Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The helicopter sustained substantial damage, and a post 
crash fire ensued. The private pilot received serious injuries and stated to his brother that he 
has no recollection of the events concerning the flight. The flight originated from a private 
heliport in Madison, Alabama, on April 1, 2006, at an undetermined time. The helicopter was 
enroute to a private heliport in Cullman, Alabama.
A witness who was driving his truck west bound in the vicinity of Cullman, Alabama stated he 
observed a helicopter flying east bound over County Road 222 between 100 to 200 feet above 
the ground. The helicopter flew over his truck and started a descent as if it was going to land. 
The driver pulled over and turned his vehicle around to watch the helicopter. The helicopter 
leveled off between 30 to 40 feet above the ground and collided with some telephone wires. 
Right before the collision, the witness stated he felt the pilot lost control of the helicopter. The 
nose of the helicopter pitched down and the helicopter collided with the ground near a highway 
guardrail and rolled over on its right side. 
Another witness who was in his back yard with his son heard the helicopter approaching their 
location. The helicopter was flying eastbound across County Road 222 near a creek in the 
vicinity of Whitlock's General Store. The witness thought the pilot was following a creek in 
preparation for landing at a private helipad where a mechanic is known to perform 
maintenance on helicopters. The helicopter was observed to start a descent. The helicopter was 
at about 30 feet above the ground when the witness heard a change in engine noise. The 
witness stated the helicopter collided with telephone lines, the nose pitched down, and the 
helicopter disappeared from view. He immediately informed his wife to call the 911 emergency 
operators. He and his son departed on a four-wheeler and went to the crash site. The helicopter 
was on fire, and he heard someone ask for a knife. He went over to the helicopter and cut the 
pilot's seat belt and the pilot was removed from the burning wreckage. The girlfriend of the 
injured pilot arrived at the accident site shortly after the accident. She stated the pilot was 
taking the helicopter to a private heliport in the immediate area so an annual inspection could 
be performed on the helicopter.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
Review of records on file with the FAA Airman Certification Branch, Oklahoma City, 
Oklahoma, revealed the pilot was issued a private pilot certificate on April 30,1988, with 
ratings for rotorcraft helicopter. The pilot held a third class medical certificate issued on June 
8, 2004, with the restriction, " Holder shall wear corrective lenses." The pilot indicated on his 
application for the third class medical certificate that he had accumulated 152 total flight 
hours. The pilot's last flight review was conducted on March 26, 2006. The pilot's logbook 
revealed he has a total of 160.1 hours of which 83.61 hours are in the B2B. The pilot has 80.6 
hours as pilot-in-command in all helicopters and 79.4 hours in the B2B. The pilot's last 
recorded flight before the accident was during his flight review. The pilot's last flight before the 
flight review was on September 8, 2005.

AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
The helicopter was a Brantly model B2B, serial No. 345, manufactured in 1965. The helicopter 
is equipped with a Lycoming IVO-360-A1A, 180 horsepower engine. The last recorded annual 
inspection was conducted on March 18, 2005. The Hobbs meter indicated 537.2 hours. The 
total time since major overhaul was 790.2 hours. The airframe total time was 1,405.0 hours. 
The helicopter has flown 4.1 hours since the annual inspection not including the accident flight. 
The Hobbs meter was destroyed by post crash fire. No Airworthiness Directive compliance list 
was located with the logbooks.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
The nearest weather reporting facility at the time of the accident was Folsum Field, Cullman, 
Alabama, located 11.2 south southwest of the accident site. The 1800 surface weather 
observation was: clear, visibility 10 miles, temperature 70 degrees Fahrenheit, dew point 
temperature 55 degrees Fahrenheit, winds calm, and altimeter 30.09. 
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The wreckage was located on County Road 222, adjacent to Whitlock's General Store, and 11.2 
miles south southwest of Folsom Field, Cullman, Alabama. Examination of the wreckage 
revealed the helicopter collided with telephone wires and guy wires before colliding with 
County Road 222, and came to rest on its right side on a heading of 170-degrees magnetic next 
to a guardrail opposing opposite traffic. 
The cabin assembly, upper and lower canopy, left and right cabin seats, seatbelts and shoulder 
harness were consumed by fire. The left doorframe separated from the airframe and the door 
glass was consumed by fire. The right cabin door separated from the airframe and received fire 
damage. The door glass was consumed by fire. The lower console instrument panel was 
consumed by fire except for the circuit breaker panel. The upper console separated from the 
lower console and was fire damaged. The pilot seat frame was present and fire damaged. 
All struts were connected to the left skid and were fire damaged. Recovery personnel cut the 
two rear struts. The forward lateral and oleo strut separated from the airframe. The drag strut 
separated from the airframe. All struts were connected to the right skid and were fire damaged.  
Recovery personnel cut the forward oleo strut. The forward lateral strut separated from the 
fuselage. Recovery personnel cut the rear lateral and rear oleo struts. The drag strut separated 
from the airframe.
The right rudder bell crank was attached to the seat frame. The left seat frame was not located. 
The left seat rudder bell crank separated from the seat and was fire damaged. Both control rods 
that connect the left seat bell crank to the rudder pedals were connected to the bell crank. The 
interconnect control rod from the left to the right rudder bell crank was found connected to the 
right bell crank and separated from the left bell crank.
The left and right rudder pedals were fire damaged, and were separated forward of the control 
rods. The left rudder cable was attached to the right bell crank and was separated aft of its 
turnbuckle. The cable was forwarded to the NTSB Laboratory for further analysis. The right 
rudder cable was attached by its safety wire to the right bell crank and separated forward of its 
turnbuckle.  The cable was forwarded to the NTSB laboratory for further analysis. The left and 
right rudder cables extended aft to the aft bell crank. The tail rotor pitch change control was 
continuous from the aft bell crank to both tail rotor blades. 
Page 5 of 9ATL06LA059
Examination of the right rudder control cable by the NTSB Materials Laboratory revealed the 
exposed surfaces displayed corrosion and the surface of the turnbuckle displayed a splatter of 
white metal. These features are commonly observed after a post impact fire (white metal 
spattered on components is normally structural aluminum that had melted, splashed onto that 
component, and eventually solidified). After cleaning, the clevis end was placed in a scanning 
electron microscope (SEM) and the fracture face was examined.  The SEM examination 
revealed that the fracture face displayed ductile dimples, typical of an overload event.
The portions of the left rudder control cable received for examination consisted of a turnbuckle 
and a length of cable that was approximately 8 inches long.  The turnbuckle was still intact and 
wire locked.  As observed on the right turnbuckle, the exposed surfaces displayed corrosion, 
and the surface of the turnbuckle displayed a splatter of white metal, features commonly 
observed after a post impact fire. The SEM examination revealed that the fracture faces on all 
the wires displayed a faceted surface and cracks that followed the grain boundaries, typical of 
an intergranular separation normally associated with an overload fracture at an elevated 
temperature.  Examination of the other end the cable portion revealed clean angular sheared 
faces on the individual wires in the cable, consistent with the cable being cut after fire 
exposure.
The left and right collective pitch was connected to one another, received fire damage, and was 
not connected to the airframe. The collective pitch tie rod was connected to the collective pitch 
assembly at the forward end and the collective bell crank assembly at the aft end. The collective 
pitch bell crank assembly was separated from the airframe and the lateral and longitudinal 
control linkage. The mixture control was in the full rich position at the fuel servo. The throttle 
cable was fire damaged and separated 6-inches aft of the throttle gear and torque tube 
assembly. The throttle stops on the fuel servo was consumed by fire and the position of the 
throttle control could not be confirmed. The throttle plate was fully open. 
The left and right cyclic control sticks remained attached to the cyclic control tube assembly 
and were not connected to the airframe. The left cyclic lateral tie rod assembly remained 
attached to the forward lateral control arm. The right cyclic lateral control tie rod assembly was 
separated from the forward lateral control arm. The aft lateral control arm was separated from 
the lateral control tube. The longitudinal control rod remained attached to the cyclic control 
tube and longitudinal control arm. The right vertical lateral control tube was separated from 
the lateral control arm at the bottom and from the swash plate assembly at the top. The vertical 
longitudinal control rod was separated at the lateral control arm at the bottom and from the 
swash plate assembly at the top. The left vertical lateral control tube was separated from the 
lateral control arm at the bottom and from the swash plate assembly at the top. All pitch

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
