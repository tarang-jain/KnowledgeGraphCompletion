Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
According to the pilot, during the takeoff roll at about rotation speed, he felt the nose landing 
gear of the airplane "give way" and the airplane began to drift to the left.  As he applied right 
rudder to correct the yaw, he felt "a continued collapse" of the nose landing gear and elected to 
abort the takeoff.  The airplane's nose and both propellers struck the ground.  Examination of 
photos provided by an insurance adjustor revealed that both engines were displaced down and 
to the right.  The right engine firewall was torn from the engine nacelle, and the left engine 
firewall was buckled and distorted.  Additionally, the photos revealed that the nose landing 
gear fork had broken into two pieces, which allowed the nose wheel to separate from the 
airplane, resulting in collapse of the nose landing gear.  The pilot reported that "an aircraft 
structural engineer made the observation that my nose gear fork had an old hidden crack that 
could have contributed to the failure."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pre-existing crack in the nose wheel fork, which allowed separation of the nose wheel 
during the takeoff roll, resulting in collapse of the nose landing gear.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
