Analysis 
THE PLT STATED THAT HE WAS RETURNING TO THE ARPT AND WAS ON THE BASE 
LEG OF THE TRAFFIC PATTERN WHEN HE EXPERIENCED A PARTIAL LOSS OF ENG 
PWR. THE PLT STATED THAT WHEN HE TURNED ON THE BOOST PUMP, PWR WAS 
RESTORED FOR A SHORT TIME. HE CONTINUED TO STATE THAT HE COULD NOT 
RESTORE SUFFICIENT PWR TO MAINTAIN FLT. AN EMERGENCY LANDING WAS 
EXECUTED IN AN OPEN FIELD. POST CRASH EXAM OF THE ENG REVEALED NO 
EVIDENCE OF A MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION OR FAILURE. THE PLT HAS 2.5 HOURS 
OF FLT TIME IN THIS MAKE AND MODEL ACFT. THE PLT STATED THAT HE MANAGED 
TO GET THE ENG STARTED ON BASE LEG AFTER THE INITIAL PWR LOSS BY USING 
THE FUEL BOOST PUMP. HE STATED THAT AFTER THE ENG STARTED HE FLIPPED 
THE BOOST PUMP SWITCH OFF AND THE ENG IMMEDIATELY LOST PWR AGAIN. THE 
PLTS HANDBOOK (FLT MANUAL) STATES THAT THE PUMP SHOULD BE ON FOR AN 
AIR START &  LEFT ON IF THE FUEL PUMP IS SUSPECTED OF FAILURE LOSS OF FUEL 
PRESSURE WITH BOOST PUMP OFF. THE PLT INDICATED THE START PROCESS WAS 
REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES WITH SIMILIAR RESULTS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
