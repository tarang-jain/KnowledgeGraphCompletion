Analysis 
THE PLT STATED THE STARTER WOULD NO ROTATE THE ENGINE PAST THE FIRST 
POWER STROKE. HE DEPLANED & THE PASSENGER STAYED ABOARD. THE PLT 
STATED THAT THE MAG SWITCH, MASTER SWITCH, AND MIXTURE COUNTROL WERE 
IN THE 'OFF' POSITION. HE ALSO REPORTED THE THROTTLE WAS AT IDLE POSITION 
& THE KEY WAS REMOVED FROM THE MAG SWITCH. THE PLT ATTEMPTED TO TURN 
THE ENGINE PAST THE COMPRESSION STROKE BY TURNING THE PROPELLER. AS HE 
ROTATED THE PROPELLER, THE ENGINE STARTED. THE PASSENGER STATED THAT 
WHEN THE ENGINE STARTED, SHE PANICKED AND PROBABLY ADVANCED THE 
THROTTLE. THE ACFT THEN BEGAN MOVING & COLLIDED WITH TWO PARKED CARS. 
AN EXAM REVEALED THE IGNITION (MAG) KEY COULD BE REMOVED WITH THE MAG 
SWITCH IN ANY POSITION. 
Probable Cause and Findings

FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO ASSURE THAT THE MAGNETO (IGNITION) SWITCH WAS IN 
THE PROPER POSITION.  A FACTOR RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WAS: PARTIAL 
FAILURE OF THE MAGNETO SWITCH, WHICH ALLOWED THE KEY TO BE REMOVED, 
THOUGH THE SWITCH WAS NOT IN THE 'OFF' POSITION.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
