Analysis 
DURING THE INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT, THE ENGINE SUFFERED A SUDDEN LOSS OF 
OIL PRESSURE, AND DURING THE FORCED LANDING, THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER 
TO THE INVERTED POSITION. AS THE OIL PRESSURE WAS DROPPING, SO WAS THE 
ENGINE RPM. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE OIL IN THE SYSTEM AFTER THE ACCIDENT 
AND THE OIL HAD BEEN BLOWING OUT THE ENGINE BREATHER SYSTEM. THE 
OPERATOR SAID THAT AFTER THE WRECKAGE HAD BEEN RECOVERED, THEY HAD 
BLOCKED OFF THE ENGINE BREATHER SYSTEM AND THEN HAD PRESSURIZED IT TO 
15 PSI, BUT COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING MECHANICAL THAT MIGHT HAVE 
PRESSURIZED THE CRANKCASE IN FLIGHT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
UNKNOWN MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION RESULTING IN ENGINE OIL STARVATION. A 
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR WAS ROUGH TERRAIN IN WHICH THE FORCED LANDING 
WAS MADE.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
