Analysis 
WHILE EN ROUTE TO SANTA PAULA AIRPORT OVER A DESERT AREA, THE PILOT FELT 
A HOT OIL SPRAY EMANATING FROM BEHIND THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. HE 
ELECTED TO LAND IN AN OPEN FIELD. THE LANDING SITE SELECTED WAS NEAR 
HIGH TRANSMISSION WIRES, WHICH HE PROBABLY DID NOT SEE UNTIL THE 
AIRPLANE WAS ON FINAL APPROACH. THE PILOT PULLED THE AIRPLANE'S NOSE UP 
TO CROSS OVER THE TOP OF THE WIRES AND ALLOWED THE AIRSPEED TO RAPIDLY 
DECAY. THE AIRPLANE STALLED AND COLLIDED WITH THE TERRAIN. THE POST-
ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE OIL PRESSURE GAUGE LINE 'B' NUT HAD 
BACKED OFF.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
