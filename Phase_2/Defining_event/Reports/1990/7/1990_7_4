PIPER PA-38-112

Destroyed

Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
THE PILOTS OF TWO SIMILAR PA-38-112 AIRPLANES WERE FILED FOR SEPARATE VFR 
CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHTS. AFTER AN INTERMEDIATE STOPOVER AT AN AIRPORT 
AWAY FROM HOME BASE, THE TWO AIRPLANES JOINED UP AND BEGAN FLYING IN 
FORMATION. ACCORDING TO A WITNESS, THE TRAILING AIRPLANE (N2409K) 
COLLIDED WITH THE LEADING AIRPLANE (N2437K) FROM THE REAR WHILE 
MANEUVERING. IMPACT, PAINT AND RUBBER TRANSFER MARKS INDICATED THAT 
N2409K COLLIDED WITH N2437K FROM THE REAR, RIGHT SIDE. THE FLIGHT SCHOOL 
FROM WHICH THE PILOTS WERE ENROLLED EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FORMATION 
FLYING OF ANY TYPE. THE PIC'S OF EACH AIRPLANE HAD LOGGED ABOUT 118 HOURS 
EACH PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT, AND HAD RECEIVED THEIR PILOT CERTIFICATES 
THE MONTH PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. THE PILOTS AND PILOT RATED PASSENGERS 
WERE ALL SPANISH CITIZENS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
FAILURE OF THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND OF N2409K TO MAINTAIN SAFE SEPARATION 
FROM N2437K DURING UNAUTHORIZED FORMATION MANEUVERING.  
OVERCONFIDENCE IN PERSONAL ABILITY AND THE EXECUTIVE OF UNAUTHORIZED 
FORMATION FLIGHT ON THE PART OF BOTH PILOTS-IN-COMMAND WERE FACTORS 
IN THE ACCIDENT.  THE LACK OF TOTAL EXPERIENCE OF BOTH PILOTS-IN-
COMMAND WAS ALSO A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
