Analysis 
DURING FLT BEFORE ACCIDENT FLT, THE LANDING GEAR MALFUNCTIONED. 
EMERGENCY GEAR EXTENSION WAS ACCOMPLISHED BUT REQUIRED EXCESSIVE 
FORCE. MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL LUBRICATED THE NOSE GEAR RETRACT CHAIN & 
ADJUSTED THE GEAR DOWN LIGHT INDICATOR SWITCH. THE AIRPLANE WAS FLOWN 
WITH NO DISCREPANCIES NOTED. THE ACCIDENT FLT WAS UNEVENTFUL UNTIL 
AFTER LOWERING THE LANDING GEAR SELECTOR HANDLE, THE GEAR DID NOT 
FULLY EXTEND. THE EMERGENCY METHOD WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. THE MAIN GEAR 
COLLAPSED DURING THE LANDING ROLL. EXAM OF THE LANDING GEAR SYSTEM 
REVEALED THAT THE NOSE GEAR ACTUATOR WAS SEIZED DUE TO LACK OF 
LUBRICATION. THE ACFT LOGBOOKS INDICATE THAT ALL GEAR ACTUATORS WERE 
REPLACED ON 8-23-86. THERE WERE NO FURTHER ENTRIES INDICATING THAT THEY 
WERE LUBRICATED. ACCORDING TO THE MAINT MANUAL, THE ACTUATORS SHOULD 
BE REMOVED FOR LUBRICATION EVERY 1,000 CYCLES OF OPERATION OR 30 MOS., 
WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST. THE ACFT ACCUMULATED 3,154 CYCLES SINCE 
REPLACEMENT OF THE ACTUATORS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE LACK OF LUBRICATION BY MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL OF THE NOSE LANDING 
GEAR ACTUATOR.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
