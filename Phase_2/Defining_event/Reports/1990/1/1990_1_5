Analysis 
THE PURPOSE OF THE FLIGHT WAS TO CHECK THE PERFORMANCE OF THE NEWLY 
INSTALLED/OVERHAULED ENGINE. BEFORE TAKEOFF, THE ENGINE WAS RUN FOR 
ABOUT AN HOUR & NO PROBLEMS WERE FOUND. THE PILOT AND THE 
MECHANIC/PASSENGER REPORTED THAT DURING THE INITIAL CLIMB AFTER 
TAKEOFF, THE FUEL PRESSURE DROPPED & THE ENGINE LOST POWER. 
SUBSEQUENTLY, THE ACFT WAS DAMAGED DURING AN EMERGENCY LANDING IN A 
FIELD. REPORTEDLY, THE PILOT DID NOT CHANGE THE POSITION OF THE FUEL 
SELECTOR AFTER THE ENGINE LOST POWER. A POST ACCIDENT EXAMINATION & 
OPERATIONAL CHECK OF THE ENGINE REVEALED NO FUEL CONTAMINATION OR 
MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION. DURING THE CHECK, THE FUEL SELECTOR WAS 
MOVED TO THE OFF POSITION WHILE THE ENGINE WAS RUNNING & THE ENGINE 
POWER WAS LOST ABOUT 15 SECONDS LATER. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
