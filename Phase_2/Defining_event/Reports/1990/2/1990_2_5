Analysis 
THE PILOT EXPERIENCED A REDUCTION IN ENGINE POWER ABOUT 400 FEET ABOVE 
THE GROUND WHILE PERFORMING A ROLLING MANEUVER. THIS WAS THE THIRD 
ROLL NEAR HIS HOME AS HIS FAMILY WATCHED. REPORTEDLY, THE ENGINE 
'STALLED,' THE PILOT LOST CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE, AND IT CRASHED IN A 
WOODED AREA.  WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE CONDUCIVE TO THE FORMATION OF 
CARBURETOR ICING. THE AIRPLANE WAS NOT CERTIFIED FOR ROLLS.  WRECKAGE 
EXAMINATION FAILED TO DISCLOSE ANY PREIMPACT PART FAILURE OR 
MALFUNCTION. THE AIRPLANE WAS DESTROYED BY IMPACT FORCES AND A POST-
CRASH FIRE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
CARBURETOR ICE DUE TO THE PILOT'S IMPROPER USE OF CARBURETOR HEAT, AND 
FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE AFTER THE 
ENGINE LOST POWER.  THE WEATHER (CARBURETOR ICING) CONDITION WAS A 
RELATED FACTOR.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
