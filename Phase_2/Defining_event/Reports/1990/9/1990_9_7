Analysis 
DURING A WX BRIEFING THE PILOT WAS ADVISED THAT VFR FLIGHT WAS NOT 
RECOMMENDED, PASSES WERE CLOSED, AND THAT TWO PILOT REPORTS INDICATED 
CLOUDS WERE TO THE GROUND NEAR A PASS. THE PILOT SUBSEQUENTLY 
CONTACTED ANCHORAGE APPROACH CONTROL STATING HE WAS 73 MI NORTH OF 
ANCHORAGE, LANDING, AND REQUESTED TRAFFIC SEPARATION AND RADAR 
VECTORS. APPROACH REPLIED THAT THE PILOT WAS TOO FAR NORTH FOR 
COVERAGE, AND TO MAINTAIN VFR CONDITIONS. THE WRECKAGE WAS LOCATED AT 
THE 4,000-FT LEVEL OF A 4,500-FT HIGH RIDGE/MOUNTAIN, IN AN AREA NEAR 
WHERE THE MINIMUM ENROUTE ALTITUDE (MEA), OR MINIMUM OBSTRUCTION 
ALTITUDE (MOCA), CHANGE FROM 10,000 FT TO 7,500 FT SOUTHBOUND. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S CONTINUED VFR FLIGHT INTO INSTRUMENT 
METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, AND FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE ALTITUDE 
FOR TERRAIN CLEARANCE. FACTORS TO THE ACCIDENT WERE THE ADVERSE 
WEATHER CONDITIONS, MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN, AND THE DARK NIGHT.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
