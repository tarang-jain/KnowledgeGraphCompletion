Analysis 
THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO COMPLETE A FLIGHT FROM 
ANCHORAGE TO MCGRATH AND RETURN WITHOUT REFUELING. HE TOPPED OFF 
THE FUEL TANKS IN ANCHORAGE PRIOR TO DEPARTURE. PRIOR TO LEAVING 
MCGRATH, HE VISUALLY INSPECTED, BUT DID NOT STICK THE TANKS. HE THOUGHT 
THE FUEL TANKS WERE SLIGHTLY MORE THAN ONE-HALF FULL. APPROXIMATELY 10 
MILES FROM ANCHORAGE THE ENGINE SPUTTERED AND EVENTUALLY STOPPED. A 
FORCED LANDING WAS MADE IN THE TUNDRA. THE PILOT LATER STATED THAT IT IS 
MOST LIKELY THAT THE ENGINE QUIT DUE TO FUEL EXHAUSTION.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
