Factual Information
 On May 1, 1998, approximately 0900 mountain daylight time, a Cessna 320D, N3316Q, 
operated by Star West Industries, Inc., was substantially damaged while taxiing after landing at 
Greybull, Wyoming.  The airline transport rated pilot and his four passengers were not injured.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the air taxi flight being conducted under Title 14 
CFR Part 135, and an IFR flight had been filed.  The flight originated at Evanston, Wyoming 
approximately 0745.
After landing on runway 33 at South Bighorn County Airport, the pilot turned the airplane 
around and back taxied towards the ramp.  As he exited the runway, the left landing gear 
collapsed.  Postaccident inspection of the landing gear performed by an FAA inspector revealed 
that the left landing gear bellcrank assembly sustained a stress overload, causing the assembly 
to break and shear both assembly bolts.  The gear retract arm was also found broken.  When 
the gear collapsed, the left wing and left horizontal stabilizer struck the ground and were 
substantially damaged.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
