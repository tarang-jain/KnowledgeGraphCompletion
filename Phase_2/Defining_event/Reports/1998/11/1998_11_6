Location:
TUCSON, AZ
Accident Number:
LAX99LA021
Date & Time:
11/02/1998, 1100 MST 
Registration:
N185Z
Aircraft:
Cessna 185E
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
On the takeoff roll the pilot's seat slid back.  The aircraft made an abrupt turn to the left, while 
the pilot was attempting to move the seat back into place.  After the unsuccessful attempt was 
made to move the seat back into place, the pilot retarded the throttle and the aircraft came to a 
stop after a ground loop.  The seats were inspected and found to be stiff and difficult to move 
fore and aft.  The seat rails and latching mechanisms were inspected and no deficiencies were 
noted. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Failure of the pilot to properly secure the seat which subsequently slid back on the takeoff roll 
and lead to the pilot's loss of aircraft control. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - ON GROUND/WATER
Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - ROLL/RUN
Findings
1. (C) FUSELAGE,SEAT - NOT SECURED
2. (C) AIRCRAFT PREFLIGHT - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND

Factual Information
 On November 2, 1998, at 1100 hours mountain standard time, a Cessna 185E, N185Z, ground 
looped and departed runway 11L on the takeoff roll at the Tucson, Arizona, airport.  The 
aircraft sustained substantial damage.  The airline transport pilot, the sole occupant, was not 
injured.  Visual meteorological conditions existed for the personal flight operated under 14 
CFR Part 91, and no flight plan was filed.  
The pilot reported that as he was on the takeoff roll his seat slid out of the detents.  He stated 
that "this pulled my feet off the rudder pedals and my hands off the controls."  The pilot 
reported that the aircraft made a turn to the left as he was attempting to move the seat forward 
to regain use of the rudders or the brakes.  He reached up to retard the throttle and the aircraft 
came to a stop after a ground loop.  No further mechanical malfunctions were noted with the 
aircraft.
According to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness inspector who examined 
the aircraft at the airport, the seat was stiff and was difficult to move fore and aft.  He reported 
that the detents in the seat rails did not show any signs of wear, and the pilot may have thought 
he had the seat locked into place because of the stiffness of the seat.  The FAA did note that the 
aircraft was 40 hours out of annual, but that the condition of the seat and seat rails would have 
passed an annual inspection.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
