Analysis 
The pilot was performing a wheel landing on runway 27 (5,500 ft. x 75 ft., elevation 7,171 feet) 
which is located on top a mesa with trees lining the south side.  He stated that he requested an 
airport advisory which gave the wind at S-SE for 10 knots with gusts to 20 knots.  When the 
airplane touched down, it began to 'weathervane,' and it exited the runway to the left striking a 
ditch and fence.  The density altitude was 10,459 feet, at the time of the accident. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the wind conditions.  Contributing factors were the 
crosswinds, the fence, and the ditch.

Factual Information
 On June 1, 1998, at 1500 mountain daylight time, a Cessna 170B, N1896C, was substantially 
damaged during landing roll near Los Alamos, New Mexico.  The private pilot, the sole 
occupant aboard, was not injured.  The airplane was registered jointly to two individuals and 
was being operated by the pilot under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed for the personal flight which originated in Espanola, New Mexico, 15 minutes before 
the accident.  No flight plan had been filed.
According to the pilot's accident report and a telephone conversation with the Investigator-In-
Charge, the pilot stated that he was performing a wheel landing on runway 27 (5,500 ft. X 75 
ft., elevation 7,171 feet), which is located on top a mesa with trees lining the south side.  He 
stated that he requested an airport advisory which gave the wind at S-SE for 10 knots with 
gusts to 20 knots.  The pilot stated that when the airplane touched down, it began to "weather 
vain," and it exited the runway to the left striking a ditch and fence.  Both wings were 
substantially damaged as well as the landing gear and propeller.
At the time of the accident, density altitude was 10,459 feet.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
