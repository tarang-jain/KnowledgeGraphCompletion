Accident Number:
FTW98LA383
Date & Time:
09/02/1998, 1740 MDT 
Registration:
N50620
Aircraft:
Air Tractor AT-502B

1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot was flying westbound into the sun (275 degrees, 7 degrees above the horizon) during 
an aerial application pass over a cotton field.  There was a circular pivotal sprinkler system 
which extended from the northern center of the field to the southeast.  The pilot said that he 
looked over to adjust his onboard global positioning system and he struck the sprinkler.  The 
impact separated the left main landing gear and initiated a fire in the right hand forward part 
of the cockpit.  The pilot landed the airplane in the adjacent peanut field and the airplane 
ground looped during the emergency landing attempt.  The airplane was destroyed during the 
subsequent post landing fire. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate altitude/clearance during an aerial application.  Also 
causal was the inadvertent ground loop/swerve during the landing.

Factual Information
 On September 2, 1998, approximately 1740 mountain daylight time, an Air Tractor AT-502B, 
N50620, was destroyed by fire following an emergency landing near Portales, New Mexico.  
The commercial pilot, the sole occupant in the airplane, received minor injuries.  The airplane 
was owned/operated by  King AG Leasing Inc. under Title 14 CFR Part 137.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed for the local aerial application flight which originated 
approximately 25 minutes before the accident.  No flight plan had been filed.
According to the pilot, he had flown 7 or 8 east-west passes over a cotton field, and was flying 
westbound into the sun (266 degrees, 19 degrees above the horizon).  He said that there was a 
circular pivotal sprinkler extending from the northern center of the field to the southeast.  He 
was adjusting his onboard global positioning system (GPS) and when he looked up, "I was right 
at the sprinkler."  He said that he "immediately pulled up elevator but still struck the 
sprinkler."  The pilot stated that a fire broke out in the right hand forward part of the cockpit 
and he knew he had to get out as soon as possible.
The pilot reported that the sprinkler impact had separated the left main landing gear and when 
he landed in the adjacent peanut field, the airplane ground looped to the left.  He further stated 
that when the airplane came to rest, "I opened the left cockpit door and bailed out as quick as 
possible."  The pilot received second degree burns on his right hand and arm, and first degree 
burns on his face.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
