Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
FORT PIERCE, FL
Accident Number:
MIA98LA117
Date & Time:
04/02/1998, 1400 EST 
Registration:
DECTB
Aircraft:
Beech F33A
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The flight had departed runway 14, and had reached an altitude of about 200 feet, when  the 
pilot reported a loss of engine power.  The pilot elected to make a forced landing straight ahead 
into trees.  After impact, the pilot closed off the fuel valve.  Examination of the wreckage after 
the accident revealed that the fuel tanks had fuel.  The pilot said the fuel selector was on the left 
tank when the loss of power occurred.  Observation of the engine at the crash site did not reveal 
any obvious discrepancies.  The engine was removed from the airframe and examined at the 
NTSB's request, and under the supervision of the FAA, on June 24, 1998.  The engine 
examination revealed that the fuel control system exhibited fluid leakage at the fuel pump and 
throttle shaft.  Detailed examination of the fuel pump showed that the pump leaked fluid at the 
rear high speed adjusting needle at the seal to the pump body.  There was no evidence of 
impact damage observed on the fuel pump.  In addition, the throttle/metering unit leaked fluid 
at the throttle shaft into the metering unit.  The leak at the throttle shaft was severe enough 
that no flow test was possible.  The throttle arm displayed impact damage.  The throttle shaft 
was removed from the unit, and the 'O' ring seal was found flat from wear.  The 'O' ring was 
replaced and the leakage stopped.  The unit was then flow tested to manufacturer's standards. 
No other discrepancies were found during the engine examination 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
a loss of engine power due to fuel leakage at the fuel control, resulting in a forced landing, and 
subsequent impact with trees.

Factual Information
 On April 2, 1998, about 1400 eastern standard time, a Beech F33A, D-ECTB (German), 
registered to a private individual, operating as a Title 14 CFR Part 91 local personal flight, 
impacted with trees during a forced landing near Fort Pierce, Florida.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed.  The airplane was destroyed.  The private-
rated pilot was not injured.  The flight was originating from the Fort Pierce Airport at the time.
The flight had departed runway 14, and had reached an altitude of about 200 feet, when  
the pilot reported a loss of engine power.  The pilot elected to make a forced landing straight 
ahead into trees.  After impact, the pilot closed off the fuel valve.  Examination of the wreckage 
after the accident revealed that the fuel tanks had fuel.  The pilot said the fuel selector was on 
the left tank when the loss of power occurred.
Observation of the engine at the crash site did not reveal any obvious discrepancies.  The 
engine was removed from the airframe and shipped to Continental Motor's facilities, Mobile, 
Alabama, and examined at the NTSB's request, and under the supervision of the FAA, on June 
24, 1998.  The engine examination revealed that the fuel control system exhibited fluid leakage 
at the fuel pump and throttle shaft.  Detailed examination of the fuel pump showed that the 
pump leaked fluid at the rear high speed adjusting needle at the seal to the pump body.  There 
was no evidence of impact damage observed on the fuel pump.  In addition, the 
throttle/metering unit leaked fluid at the throttle shaft into the metering unit.  The leak at the 
throttle shaft was severe enough that no flow test was possible.  The throttle arm displayed 
impact damage.  The throttle shaft was removed from the unit, and the "O" ring seal was found 
flat from wear.  The ring was replaced and the leakage stopped.  The unit was then flow tested 
to manufacturer's standards.  No other discrepancies were found during the engine 
examination (see TCM Analytical report Page 3).
At the airplane owner's request, the engine was shipped to Fort Pierce, Florida, on July 
23, 1998, directly from TCM, Mobile, Alabama.

NTSB accident and incident dockets serve as permanent archival information for the NTSB™s 
investigations. Dockets released prior to June 1, 2009 are publicly available from the NTSB™s

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
