Location:
POINT LOOKOUT, MO
Accident Number:
CHI98LA234
Date & Time:
07/01/1998, 1330 CDT 
Registration:
N5643L
Aircraft:
American Aviation Corp. (AAC) AA-
1TW
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot stated that during the landing roll the tailwheel began to vibrate.  The vibration 
increased and the airplane made a 'sharp yaw to the left.'  After about 30 degrees of turn, the 
right landing gear attach bracket bolts sheared and the right wing contacted the runway.  The 
airplane then skidded to the right side of the runway and exited the runway tail first. 
Inspection of the airplane revealed the right arm of the tailwheel had failed approximately 1' 
from the center of the arm.  Corrosion was present on the factured surface. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the failure of the tailwheel assembly due to corrosion.  A factor associated with the accident 
was the overload failure of the right main landing gear.

Factual Information
 On July 1, 1998, at 1330 central daylight time, an American Yankee AA1-1TW, N5643L, 
impacted the terrain following a loss of directional control during a landing roll on runway 29 
(3,539' x 100') at the Clark Airport, Point Lookout, Missouri.  The ATP pilot and passenger 
were not injured and the airplane sustained substantial damage.  The airplane was being 
operated as a personal flight under 14 CFR part 91 when the accident occurred.  The flight 
originated Cape Girardeau, Missouri, at 1145.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and 
no flight plan was filed.
The pilot stated that during the landing roll, following a 3-point landing, the tailwheel began to 
vibrate.  He reported the vibration increased and the airplane made a "sharp yaw to the left."  
After about 30 degrees of turn, the right landing gear attach bracket bolts sheared and the right 
wing contacted the runway.  The airplane then skidded to the right side of the runway and 
exited the runway tail first.
Inspection of the runway by the Clark Airport Operations Supervisor revealed tail wheel skid 
marks were present on the runway for a length in excess of 150 yards.  
Inspection of the airplane by an Inspector from the Kansas City Federal Aviation 
Administration Flight Standards District Office revealed the right arm of the tailwheel had 
failed approximately 1" from the center of the arm.  Corrosion was present on the factured 
surface.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
