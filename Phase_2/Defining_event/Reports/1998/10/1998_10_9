Factual Information
 On October 2, 1998, at 1920 mountain daylight time, a Piper PA-28RT-201T, N8182J, 
registered to Neuro Air, Inc., was substantially damaged during a hard landing at Coronado 
Airport, Albuquerque, New Mexico. The commercial pilot and his passenger were not injured.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal cross-county flight being conducted 
under Title 14 CFR Part 91, and a VFR flight plan had been filed.  The flight originated at 
Centennial Airport, Denver, Colorado, at 1725.    
According to the pilot's accident report, the en route portion of the flight was without incident.  
As he approached Coronado Airport, another pilot informed him that runway 35 (4,010 ft. x 60 
ft., asphalt) was the active runway.  He also warned him of 50 foot trees near the approach end 
of the runway.  The pilot said he remained "higher on the approach. . .then reduced power and 
began a slightly more steep descent than usual" (using 25 degrees flaps.)  When he flared the 
airplane approximately 10 feet above the runway, it "must have stalled."  A hard landing 
followed.  The right side of the fuselage was buckled aft of the cabin entry door and forward of 
the cargo door.  According to Coronado Airport officials, the trees at the end of runway 35 are 
approximately 20 to 25 feet tall.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
