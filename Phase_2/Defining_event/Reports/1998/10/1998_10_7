ATL99LA002
Date & Time:
10/02/1998, 0835 CDT 
Registration:
N4832R
Aircraft:
Cessna 188B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot was approaching from the northeast for a swath spray, waiting to fly over power lines 
that intersected a cotton field at the arrival end. The pilot thought that he was clear to push 
over into the cotton field to start his spray run. However, he was not completely clear of the 
power lines and on the push over became entangled with the ridge wire that runs from one pole 
to another giving the poles stability. The wire tangled between the propeller blades and around 
the propeller shaft slowing the engine to a stop. While tethered by the cable the aircraft fell 
approximately 250 to 300 feet, striking a slope and turning almost 180 degrees from the 
direction of impact. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from a utility line while conducting a swath run. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH OBJECT
Phase of Operation: MANEUVERING - AERIAL APPLICATION
Findings
1. OBJECT - WIRE,STATIC
2. (C) CLEARANCE - MISJUDGED - PILOT IN COMMAND

Factual Information
 On October 2, 1998 about 0835 Central Daylight Time, a Cessna 188B agricultural airplane, 
N4832R, collided with a high tension line and subsequently the ground while spraying a field 
in Tellasse, Alabama. The airplane was operated by Morris Flying Services, Inc., under the 
provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 137, and visual flight rules. Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the local flight. The commercial pilot sustained minor 
injuries and the airplane received substantial damage. The flight originated from Shorter, 
Alabama, at 0750.
  According to the FAA Inspector, who interviewed the pilot, the pilot was approaching from 
the northeast for a swath spray, waiting to fly over power lines that intersected a cotton field at 
the arrival end. The pilot thought that he was clear to push over into the cotton field to start his 
spray run. However, he was not completely clear of the power lines and on the push over 
became entangled with the ridge wire that runs from one pole to another giving the poles 
stability.
  The wire tangled between the propeller blades and around the propeller shaft slowing the 
engine to a stop. While tethered by the cable the aircraft fell approximately 250 to 300 feet, 
striking a slope and turning almost 180 degrees from the direction of impact, substantially 
damaging the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
