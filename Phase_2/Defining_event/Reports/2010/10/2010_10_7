Analysis   
According to the pilot, he was back taxiing on the runway when the tailwind and runway slope 
allowed the airplane to gain more than normal taxi speed. As the pilot realized the airplane was 
approaching the end of the runway, he began to apply brake pressure to avoid running off the 
end of the runway. The airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted, substantially damaging 
the rudder. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical malfunctions 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s improper use of the brakes while taxiing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
