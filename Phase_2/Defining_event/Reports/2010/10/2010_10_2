Analysis   
The pilot reported that after takeoff, about 250 feet above ground level (agl), the engine 
experienced a total loss of power. He reduced the throttle to idle and attempted to land on the 
runway; however, there was not enough distance remaining. He subsequently pushed the 
throttle forward and the engine regained power. As the airplane reached approximately 250 
feet agl, the engine lost power again. The pilot subsequently set up for a forced landing to a 
harvested corn field immediately west of the airport. The airplane nosed over during the 
emergency landing. A postaccident examination of the engine revealed no anomalies consistent 
with a preimpact failure or malfunction.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
