Analysis   
The pilot stated that after takeoff, he experienced a primary trim failure and continued to the 
destination using secondary trim. The pilot stated that during final approach his airspeed was 
too high to lower the landing gear. The pilot "continued working the trim," and was looking for 
any traffic in the pattern. In the landing flare, he heard "an unusual noise like something 
scraping," performed a go-around, and realized he had not extended the landing gear. The pilot 
then extended the gear and landed without incident. Inspection of the airplane revealed 
substantial damage to the airplane's fuselage.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to properly configure the landing gear for landing. Contributing to the 
accident was the pilot's diverted attention looking for traffic and manipulating the secondary 
trim controls.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
