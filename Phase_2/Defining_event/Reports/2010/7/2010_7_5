Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The certified flight instructor (CFI) and private pilot student were conducting tailwheel 
certification training.  During the third flight of the day, after practicing 3-point landings, the 
student pilot was performing an additional 3-point landing after having just practiced main 
wheel landings.  The CFI described the pattern and approach as being normal.  During the roll 
out and while slowing the airplane down, it began to drift left.  The CFI called for right rudder 
and the airplane began drifting right of centerline.  After calling for left rudder the CFI 
attempted to regain control using rudder and power.  The airplane entered a violent turn to the 
left, exited the runway, and flipped over going down an embankment.  The right wing spar and 
horizontal stabilizer were bent.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control and the certified flight instructor's 
delay in remedial action.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
