Piper PA-12
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Ferry
Analysis   
The pilot stated that tailwheel-equipped airplane was accelerating on the takeoff roll when the 
tail became airborne before rotation speed, which was immediately followed by a left 
yaw/swerve. He attempted to regain directional control with right rudder and brake inputs, but 
the airplane continued in the left swerve. He elected to abort the takeoff by reducing engine 
power to idle while continuing to apply right rudder and brake inputs. He used aggressive 
braking as the airplane approached the left edge of the runway, but the airplane continued off 
the runway and struck several trees. He noted that the turf-runway was dew covered and that 
the wind was at approximately 3 knots, with no gusts. The leading edge of both wings, vertical 
stabilizer, and rudder were substantially damaged during the accident. A postaccident 
inspection of the airplane did not reveal any mechanical malfunction of the tailwheel or 
braking systems.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of directional control during the takeoff roll.
Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
