BEECH 76

Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The certified flight instructor (CFI) and student pilot were performing a short field landing in 
the multi-engine airplane. The CFI reported that the student pilot was at the controls, and 
performing a stable landing approach. During the landing flare the airplane banked 30 degrees 
to the right and the CFI attempted to apply corrective control inputs. He stated that the 
airspeed, altitude, and bank angle prevented him from performing a go-around. The airplane 
landed, departed the runway, and came to rest beyond a parallel taxiway. Post accident 
examination revealed damage to the right aileron, and creases in the upper wing skins, 
adjacent to the right engine. The CFI stated that there were no mechanical malfunctions of 
failures of the airplane, and that gusting left crosswinds existed at the time of the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's inadequate compensation for the gusting crosswind conditions and the 
certified flight instructor's inadequate supervision, resulting in a loss of directional control 
during landing. 
Findings

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=75978
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
