Location:
Jackson, TN
Accident Number:
ERA10LA131
Date & Time:
02/03/2010, 1348 CST 
Registration:
N97075
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The student pilot landed, taxied back to the runway, and departed again. She stayed in the 
traffic pattern and then landed again with a slight crosswind at about 3 knots. During the 
subsequent takeoff with full power, the airplane veered to the left. The student pilot applied 
right rudder, but the airplane continued to the left and veered into a snow bank. A postaccident 
examination of the airplane's nose landing gear revealed that the right bearing rod-end had 
broken off the arm assembly of the nose gear steering rod. Further examination of both 
components through magnified optics revealed deformation and fracture surface features 
consistent with bending overstress separations in both components. No indications of 
preexisting conditions, such as fatigue or corrosion, were found.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's loss of directional control during the takeoff roll, which resulted in a 
collision with a snow bank.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Student pilot (Cause)

Factual Information
On February 3, 2010, at 1348 central standard time, a Cessna 172P, N97075, sustained 
substantial damage when it collided with a snow bank during a takeoff attempt at McKellar-
Sipes Regional Airport (MKL) Jackson, Tennessee. The certificated student pilot was not 
injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a visual flight rules flight plan was filed 
for the instructional flight. The airplane was registered to and operated by the Civil Air Patrol 
under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The flight originated at 
Savannah-Hardin County Airport (SNH), Savannah, Tennessee, at 1245.
According to the student pilot, she landed on runway 2 at MKL, taxied back and took off with 
closed traffic. She landed again on runway 2, with the winds being from 320-degrees at 3 
knots. She stated that during the accident takeoff with full power, the airplane veered to the 
left. She added more right rudder to compensate for the left drift, but felt a jerk, and the 
airplane continued to turn left. The airplane impacted a snow bank on the left side of the 
runway, at which time the nose landing gear collapsed and the propeller made contact with the 
runway surface. 
Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector confirmed 
that the airplane had impacted a snow bank off the left side of the runway, collapsing the nose 
landing gear and damaging the firewall. Further examination of the nose gear found the right 
ﬁbearing-rod endﬂ broken off the ﬁarm assembly-nose gear steering rod.ﬂ The bearing-rod end 
and the arm assembly were sent to the NTSB™s Materials Laboratory for further examination.
The examination of the bearing-rod end and the arm assembly-nose gear steering rod through 
magnified optical inspections revealed deformation and fracture surface features consistent 
with bending overstress separations in both components. No indications of preexisting 
conditions, such as fatigue or corrosion, were noted.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
