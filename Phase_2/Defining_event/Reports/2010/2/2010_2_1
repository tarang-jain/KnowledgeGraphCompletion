During takeoff the pilot heard a "pop" noise followed by smoke in the cockpit. The pilot elected 
to continue the takeoff roll and return to the airport; during the downwind leg, the smoke 
became severe. The pilot was able to land the airplane safely. Examination of the airplane 
revealed that the engine, cowling, and firewall sustained fire damage. Additionally the 
inspection revealed that a fuel injector/line on the No. 5 cylinder was broken and had sprayed 
fuel onto the engine's turbocharger.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
