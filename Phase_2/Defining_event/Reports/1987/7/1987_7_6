Analysis 
THE AIRCRAFT HAD TO TAKE OFF EASTBOUND DUE TO OBSTRUCTIONS AT THE WEST 
END OF THE STRIP. THE SIX TO EIGHT KNOT WIND WAS VARIABLE FROM A RIGHT 
CROSSWIND TO A SLIGHT TAILWIND. INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE AIRCRAFT'S 
WEIGHT EXCEEDED THAT ESTABLISHED BY THE MANUFACTURER. LIFTOFF WAS 
ACHIEVED BUT THE AIRCRAFT STARTED SETTLING AS SOON AS IT CLIMBED OUT OF 
GROUND EFFECT. THE DESCENT WAS ARRESTED BUT CLIMB COULD NOT BE RE-
ESTABLISHED BEFORE THE AIRCRAFT CONTACTED HIGH VEGETATION BEYOND THE 
END OF THE RUNWAY AND DESCENDED TO THE GROUND. TOUCHDOWN WAS ON 
ROUGH TERRAIN. A COMBINATION OF HIGH VEGETATION AND ROUGH TERRAIN 
CAUSED THE AIRCRAFT TO NOSE DOWN BEFORE IT STOPPED.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
