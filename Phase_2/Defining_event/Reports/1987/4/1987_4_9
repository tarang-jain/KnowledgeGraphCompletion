Analysis 
THE PILOT STATED THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS OPERATING NORMALLY WHEN HE 
ESTABLISHED HIMSELF ON FINAL APPROACH FOR RWY 32. WINDS WERE FROM THE 
NORTHEAST AT 25 KTS, THE PILOT FURTHER STATED, SO HE ABANDONED THE 
APPROACH AND WAS IN THE PROCESS OF CIRCLING THE FIELD FOR A LANDING ON 
RWY 02 WHEN THE ENGINE BEGAN LOSING POWER. ACCORDING TO A MECHANIC-
WITNESS ON THE GROUND, THE AIRCRAFT'S ENGINE 'SOUNDED BAD--LIKE A 
BLOWER FAILURE', AS IT FLEW OVER THE HANGAR WHILE CIRCLING FOR ANOTHER 
APPROACH. AT THIS POINT, THE WITNESS FURTHER STATED, THE ENGINE BEGAN 
BELCHING SMOKE AND TOTALLY LOST POWER. THE PILOT ATTEMPTED A RETURN 
TO THE FIELD BUT HE RAN OUT OF ALTITUDE--AND WAS FORCED TO LAND IN A 
FIELD ADJACENT TO THE AIRPORT. THE AIRCRAFT BOUNCED UPON TOUCHDOWN, 
THEN NOSED OVER. A POST-ACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE POWERPLANT 
REVEALED THAT A BLOWER BEARING HAD FAILED.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
