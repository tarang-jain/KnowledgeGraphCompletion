Location:
ANCHORAGE, AK
Accident Number:
ANC87MA057

Registration:
N967JW
Aircraft:
CESSNA 402
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Scheduled
Analysis 
THE ACFT WAS ON THE LAST LEG OF A SCHEDULED COMMUTER FLIGHT, WHEN IT 
CRASHED IN A HEAVILY WOODED AREA WHILE MAKING A VFR APPROACH TO 
MERRILL FIELD, ANCHORAGE, AK. THE CAPT AND HIS SOLE PASSENGER WERE 
KILLED IN THE CRASH WHEN THE AIRPLANE STRUCK THE GROUND UPSIDE-DOWN 
IN A NEAR VERTICAL ATTITUDE. THE AIRPLANE'S COPILOT, WHO HAD DEPLANED 
MINUTES BEFORE THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT, SAID HE DID NOT SEE THE CAPT USE THE 
AIRCRAFT'S AUXILIARY FUEL TANKS AT ANY TIME DURING THAT EVENING'S 
EARLIER FLIGHTS. THE AIRPLANE'S MAIN FUEL TANKS HOLD 100 GALLONS OF 
USEABLE FUEL; IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE AIRPLANE WOULD HAVE CONSUMED 
SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 100 GALLONS OF FUEL AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. 
AMPLE FUEL REMAINED IN THE AUXILIARY TANKS, BUT AN ENGINE RESTART 
CANNOT BE READILY ACCOMPLISHED IF THE AUXILIARY TANKS ARE NOT SELECTED 
PRIOR TO THE ENGINE'S QUITTING.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
