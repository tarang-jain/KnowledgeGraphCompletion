Analysis 
THE CFI RECEIVED A FSS WEATHER BRIEFING FORECASTING SNOW SHOWERS BOTH

DURING THE RETURN LEG, THE FLIGHT ENCOUNTERED HEAVY SNOW SHOWERS. 
THE DUAL STUDENT FLEW WHILE THE CFI FILED AND OBTAINED IFR CLEARANCE.

CLEARANCE PROCEDURES. BOTH PILOTS SAID THE ENGINE QUIT. THE DUAL 
STUDENT ENTERED EMERGENCY DESCENT WHILE THE CFI ADDED CARBURETOR 
HEAT AND ATTEMPTED AN ENGINE RESTART, TO NO AVAIL. WHEN THE STUDENT 
SAID HE SAW THE TERRAIN, THE CFI TOOK THE FLIGHT CONTROLS AND COMPLETED 
AN EMERGENCY LANDING. AT TOUCHDOWN, THE NOSE WHEEL COLLAPSED IN THE 
PLOWED FIELD. THE PLANE SLID TO REST WITH A DAMAGED FUSELAGE AND LEFT

FAILURE OF THE CFI TO UTILIZE CARBURETOR HEAT PRIOR TO THE INDUCTION 
ICING AND POWER LOSS. CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE CFI'S 
CONTINUED VFR FLIGHT INTO KNOWN AND FORECAST INSTRUMENT

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
