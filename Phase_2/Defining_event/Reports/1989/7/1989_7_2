Analysis 
THE PLT WAS ON CLIMB OUT, AT 200 FT AGL, AFTER DOING THE THIRD T & G LNDG, 
WHEN THE ENG STARTED LOSING PWR. THE PLT MADE A FORCED LNDG IN AN OPEN 
FIELD AND THE ACFT STRUCK A POLE AND TREE. THE PLT SAID HE PUT THE ACFT IN 
A LEFT SLIP DURING THE THIRD LNDG APPROACH AND WAS USING THE LEFT FUEL 
TANK DURING THE FLIGHT. EXAMINATION OF THE ACFT REVEALED THE FUEL 
TANKS EACH HAD 5 GALS OF FUEL. EACH TANK CAPACITY IS 12.5 GALS. THE ENG 
STARTED ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT AND OPERATED WITHOUT DISCREPANCY DURING 
THE POST ACCIDENT EXAMINATION. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER BECAUSE OF FUEL STARVATION. FUEL STARVATION 
OCCURRED BECAUSE OF UNPORTING OF FUEL FROM THE TANK OUTLET WHEN THE 
AIRCRAFT WAS IN A SLIP ATTITUDE SHORTLY BEFORE THE POWER LOSS. A 
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IS INADEQUATE INFORMATION IN THE FLIGHT MANUAL 
CAUTIONING OF THE POTENTIAL UNPORTING OF THE FUEL OUTLET.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
