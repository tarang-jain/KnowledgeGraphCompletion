Analysis 
THE PILOT WAS EN ROUTE AT 11,500 FEET AND WAS RECEIVING TRAFFIC 
ADVISORIES FROM AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, WHO ADVISED HIM OF HEAVY 
PRECIPITATION AHEAD.  THE PILOT BEGAN A DESCENT ABOUT 14 MILES FROM HIS

CONDITIONS, WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGED.  THE PILOT LATER REPORTED HE HAD 
ENCOUNTERED RAIN AND TURBULENCE AND THAT HE WAS NOT IN VMC. ATC LOST 
CONTACT WITH THE AIRPLANE SOON AFTERWARDS. WITNESSES REPORTED A 
SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WHEN THEY SAW THE AIRPLANE DESCEND AND CRASH.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
