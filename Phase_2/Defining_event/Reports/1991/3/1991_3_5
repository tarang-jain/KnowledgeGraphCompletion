Analysis 
 THE PILOT OF THE MULTI-ENGINE AIRCRAFT REPORTED THAT HIS RIGHT ENGINE 
WAS LOSING OIL AS HE WAS CLIMBING TO CRUISE ALTITUDE. HE SECURED THE 
ENGINE, FEATHERED THE PROPELLER, AND MANEUVERED TO RETURN TO THE 
AIRPORT. THE PILOT TRIMMED THE AIRCRAFT FOR SINGLE ENGINE OPERATION 
AND EXTENDED THE MAIN LANDING GEAR. DURING THE APPROACH, THE 
OPERATING LEFT ENGINE WOULD NOT DEVELOP FULL POWER AND THE PILOT 
REPORTED TO ATC THAT HE COULD NOT MAKE THE AIRPORT. THE AIRCRAFT 
CONTINUED ITS EMERGENCY DESCENT, IMPACTED TREES, AND DESCENDED 
UNCONTROLLED THROUGH A DENSELY WOODED AREA. A FUEL TANK RUPTURED 
DURING THE UNCONTROLLED DESCENT THROUGH THE TREES AND A 
FIRE/EXPLOSION OCCURRED. THE AIRCRAFT CONTINUED TO BURN AFTER GROUND 
IMPACT. BOTH ENGINES WERE DISASSEMBLED AND NUMEROUS MECHANICAL 
ANOMALIES WERE FOUND. THEY HAD BEEN RECENTLY OVERHAULED. THIS WAS 
THE FIRST FLIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT SINCE THE ENGINE OVERHAULS. THE 
PILOT/OWNER WAS EN ROUTE TO SELL THE AIRCRAFT WHEN THE ACCIDENT 
OCCURRED. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE PILOT'S OPERATION OF THE AIRCRAFT WITH KNOWN DEFICIENCIES IN 
EQUIPMENT. FACTORS WERE THE IMPROPER OVERHAUL OF THE ENGINES BY 
OTHER MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL RESULTING IN OIL LOSS, DETERIORATED 
ENGINE PERFORMANCE, AND UNSUITABLE TERRAIN.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
