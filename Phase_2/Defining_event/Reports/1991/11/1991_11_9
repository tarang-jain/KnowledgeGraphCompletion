Analysis 
 A PRIVATE PILOT WAS ADVISED BY THE WEATHER BRIEFER THAT VFR FLIGHT WAS 
NOT RECOMMENDED ALONG HIS ROUTE OF FLIGHT DUE TO LOW VISIBILITIES AND 
SNOW SHOWERS. THE NON INSTRUMENT RATED PILOT ELECTED TO DEPART ON HIS 
CROSS COUNTRY FIGHT AND ENCOUNTERED THE PREVIOUSLY FORECASTED 
WEATHER ENROUTE. THE HEAVY SHOW SHOWERS CAUSED A BLOCKAGE OF THE AIR 
INDUCTION FILTER SCREEN. THE PILOT MANAGED TO FOLLOW AN INTERSTATE 
HIGHWAY AT LOW ALTITUDE UNTIL AN AIRPORT WAS FOUND. WHILE LANDING, THE 
RIGHT MAIN LANDING GEAR IMPACTED A LARGE SNOW DRIFT, CAUSING THE 
AIRPLANE TO DRIFT OFF THE RUNWAY AND FLIP OVER. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT 
DUE TO HIS LOW ALTITUDE AND DIMINISHING POWER, HE WAS UNABLE TO 
PROPERLY ALIGN THE AIRPLANE WITH THE RUNWAY BEFORE LANDING. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S POOR JUDGEMENT IN ATTEMPTING FLIGHT INTO FORCASTED ADVERSE 
WEATHER, HIS DISREGARD FOR THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER ADVISORY RECEIVED 
WHICH RESULTED IN PARTIAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER AS A RESULT OF A BLOCKED 
INDUCTION SYSTEM DUE TO ICE AND SNOW, AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO 
PROPERLY ALIGN THE AIRCRAFT WITH THE RUNWAY.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
