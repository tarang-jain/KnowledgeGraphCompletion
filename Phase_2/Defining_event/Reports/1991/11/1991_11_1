Analysis 
 THE PILOT OF A SINGLE ENGINED AIRPLANE HAD JUST RECEIVED AN IFR 
CLEARANCE. THE AIRPLANE PERFORMED AN INTERSECTION TAKEOFF AT NIGHT 
WITH WINDS GUSTING TO 30 KNOTS AND BLOWING SNOW.  JUST PRIOR TO 
ROTATION THE PILOT STATED HE OBSERVED THE AIRSPEED INDICATOR 
DISPLAYING '0'.  HE DECIDED TO TAKEOFF BECAUSE HE BELIEVED INSUFFICIENT 
RUNWAY REMAINED FOR AN ABORTED TAKEOFF. AFTER TAKEOFF THE PILOT 
STATED HIS OTHER PRESSURE INSTRUMENTS WERE NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.  
THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH TREE AND TERRAIN APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES 
FROM THE AIRPORT'S CENTER.  THE ON SCENE INVESTIGATION REVEALED A SLIGHT 
TRACE OF ICE WAS ON THE WINGS LEADING EDGE.  ONE OF THE TWO STATIC PORTS 
WAS FOUND WITH ICE BLOCKING IT.  THE SECOND STATIC PORT WAS DESTROYED 
DURING THE CRASH SEQUENCE.  THE ALTERNATE STATIC SOURCE SWITCH WAS 
FOUND IN THE 'STANDBY' POSITION.  THE PILOT STATED, 'I FIGURED I COULD USE 
THE ALTERNATE STATIC SOURCE ONCE I WAS UP HIGH ENOUGH TO CLEAR THE 
TREES.' 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 INADEQUATE PREFLIGHT PLANNING AND PREPARATION BY THE PILOT IN 
COMMAND, THE NON PERFORMANCE O FAN EMERGENCY PROCEDURE AND NOT 
MAINTAINING A POSITIVE RATE OF CLIMB ON BEHALF OF THE PILOT IN COMMAND.  
FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WERE THE PILOT IN COMMAND'S NOT 
REMOVING ICE FROM THE AIRPLANE, NOT OBTAINING ALTITUDE DURING THE 
CLIMB, AND NOT MAINTAINING DIRECTIONAL CONTROL.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
