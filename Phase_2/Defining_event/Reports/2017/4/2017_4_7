Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Millbrook, NY
Accident Number:
GAA17CA219
Date & Time:
04/02/2017, 1330 EDT 
Registration:
N734SN
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
1 Minor, 3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that, during approach and after fully extending the flaps, he felt the airplane 
was descending too quickly, so he added power. He added that "the aircraft was nearly down 
when [a] crosswind" drifted the airplane off the runway centerline. The pilot added more 
power, but the stall warning horn sounded, and the nose dropped. The airplane impacted a 
drainage pond to the left of the runway and came to rest inverted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed and his exceedance of the airplane's critical 
angle of attack during landing with a crosswind, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and an 
off-runway landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
