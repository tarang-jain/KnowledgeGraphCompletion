Analysis   
The director of aviation safety for the flight school reported that the student pilot was on her 
first solo cross-country flight and that, during the approach to land, the airplane was fast and 
high. Subsequently, the airplane landed nose low, and the propeller struck the ground. The 
student did not know the propeller or fuselage had been damaged during the landing and 
continued the rest of her intended flight without further incident.
The next assigned flight crew discovered the damage, and an examination by the maintenance 
department revealed that the airplane had sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The director of aviation safety reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or 
malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in the propeller striking the ground.
Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
