Location:
Loveland, CO
Accident Number:
GAA17CA131
Date & Time:
02/05/2017, 1555 MST 
Registration:
N4853U
Aircraft:
CESSNA T210
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that the airplane was low and that he felt "rushed" during final approach. He 
added that, during the landing roll, the airplane "started to veer off the runway," so he applied 
power to abort the landing and that, during the aborted landing, he "pulled back" on the yoke. 
The airplane then aerodynamically stalled and impacted grass left of the runway and then 
nosed over.
The fuselage, left wing, and vertical stabilizer sustained substantial damage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during an attempted go-around, 
which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
Findings
Aircraft
Angle of attack - Capability exceeded (Cause)
Directional control - Not attained/maintained
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)

Preventing Similar Accidents
Prevent Aerodynamic Stalls at Low Altitude
While maneuvering an airplane at low altitude in visual meteorological conditions, many pilots 
fail to avoid conditions that lead to an aerodynamic stall, recognize the warning signs of a stall 
onset, and apply appropriate recovery techniques. Many stall accidents result when a pilot is 
momentarily distracted from the primary task of flying, such as while maneuvering in the 
airport traffic pattern, during an emergency, or when fixating on ground objects.
An aerodynamic stall can happen at any airspeed, at any altitude, and with any engine power 
setting. Pilots need to be honest with themselves about their knowledge of stalls and 
Page 4 of 4GAA17CA131
preparedness to recognize and handle a stall situation. Training can help pilots fully 
understand the stall phenomenon, including angle-of-attack (AOA) concepts and how weight, 
center of gravity, turbulence, maneuvering loads, and other factors can affect an airplane's stall 
characteristics. The stall characteristics may be different in each type of airplane, so learn them 
before you fly.
The stall airspeeds marked on the airspeed indicator (for example, the bottom of the green arc 
and the bottom of the white arc) typically represent steady flight speeds at 1G at the airplane's 
maximum gross weight in the specified configuration. Maneuvering loads and other factors can 
increase the airspeed at which the airplane will stall. For example, increasing bank angle can 
increase stall speed exponentially.
Reducing AOA by lowering the airplane's nose at the first indication of a stall is the most 
important immediate response for stall avoidance and stall recovery. This may seem 
counterintuitive at low altitudes, but is a necessary first step.

The NTSB presents this information to prevent recurrence of similar accidents. Note that this should 
not be considered guidance from the regulator, nor does this supersede existing FAA Regulations 
(FARs).

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=94694
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
