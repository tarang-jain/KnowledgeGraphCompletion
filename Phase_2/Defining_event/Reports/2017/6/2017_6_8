ARROW LSA
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that, during takeoff from a private turf airstrip, about 50 ft above the 
ground, the airplane encountered a wind gust that "quickly" lifted the left wing and pushed the 
airplane to the right. He added that he attempted to level the wings, but he "did not have 
enough aileron." Subsequently, the airplane impacted terrain in a nose-low, right-wing-down 
attitude. 
The fuselage and both wings sustained substantial damage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported that the temperature was 85°, the sky was clear, and the wind was from 
200° at 5 knots and not gusting. He took off from runway 23.
An automated weather observation station, about 14 nautical miles from the accident airport, 
recorded wind from 170° at 9 knots, gusting to 20 knots. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain lateral/bank control during the takeoff climb in gusting 
crosswind conditions.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
