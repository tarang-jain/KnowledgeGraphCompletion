Analysis   
The pilot reported that, during the initial climb, about 1,000 ft above the ground, he "saw the 
engine power winding down." He added that he "turned on" the boost pump, checked the 
magnetos and fuel mixture, and then switched the fuel selector to the other fuel tank. The 
engine experienced a total loss of power and then impacted the ground. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. 
The Federal Aviation Administration inspector reported that he traveled to the accident, and 
while on-site, he observed that the fuel selector knob set screw was loose and that the knob 
turned freely on the shaft. 
The pilot did not submit the National Transportation Safety Board Form 6120.1 Pilot/Operator 
Aircraft Accident/Incident Report. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loose fuel tank selector knob set screw, which prevented the fuel selector from moving to 
the fuel tank position for the tank with usable fuel and resulted in fuel starvation and the 
subsequent total loss of engine power.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
