Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Atlanta, GA
Accident Number:
GAA17CA283
Date & Time:
05/02/2017, 0935 EDT 
Registration:
N704RB
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The flight instructor reported that he and his student were practicing landings. He reported 
that his student's approach was unstable and left of the centerline as the airplane approached 
the runway numbers. The instructor called for a go-around and applied full throttle, and the 
student pitched for a climb, but the airplane stalled. The instructor pushed the nose down to 
increase the airspeed, but the airplane impacted the runway. The airplane sustained 
substantial damage to both wings and the empennage. 
The flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or 
failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student's incorrect use of the go-around procedure, which resulted in an aerodynamic 
stall, and the flight instructor's delayed remedial action.
Findings
Aircraft
Pitch control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Delayed action - Instructor/check pilot (Cause)
Aircraft control - Instructor/check pilot (Cause)
Use of policy/procedure - Student pilot (Cause)

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=95182
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
