Registration:
N600XX
Aircraft:
MAULE MX7
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Nose over/nose down
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, while on base for his private grass 
airstrip, he noticed he was high, so he added flaps to increase his descent. He added that, on 
final, the airspeed was a little fast and during the landing, he flared the airplane "a little high." 
After touchdown, the pilot applied the brakes, but the airplane did not respond, so he applied 
"a little more brake"; subsequently, the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported as a safety recommendation that he should have performed a go-around 
instead of attempting to "salvage the landing."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain a stabilized approach and his subsequent incorrect brake 
application during the landing roll, which resulted in a nose-over.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
