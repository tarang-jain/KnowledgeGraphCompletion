Factual Information
 On October 1, 2000, at 1605 eastern daylight time, a Piper PA-28-181, N43055, registered to 
and operated by the pilot, was substantially damaged when it collided with terrain and water 
during landing at Boone Airport in Boone, North Carolina.  The private pilot was not injured, 
and the passenger received minor injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no 
flight plan was filed for the personal flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  The 
flight originated from Moore County Airport in Pinehurst, North Carolina, at 1456.  
According to the pilot, he landed long on runway 31 (2,100 ft. x 40 ft.) with a tailwind present.  
Rather than performing a go-around due to mountainous terrain off the end of the runway, he

deep ravine.  The airplane sustained damage to the engine, propeller, firewall, and left wing 
spar.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
