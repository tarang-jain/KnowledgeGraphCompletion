Factual Information
 On July 1, 2000, at 1530 eastern daylight time, a Schleicher K8B glider, N885D, piloted by a 
student pilot, sustained substantial damage during an in-flight collision with a fence-post while 
on final approach to runway 18 (2,465 feet by 100 feet, dry/turf) at the Rossettie Airport, 
Manchester, Michigan.  Visual metrological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  
The solo flight was operating under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91 and was not on a flight 
plan.  The pilot, the sole occupant, reported no injuries.  The local flight departed the Rossettie 
Airport, at an undetermined time.
According to the student pilot's written statement, "Normal pattern approach[,] turned final 
with approx [approximately] 400 ft agl [feet above ground level], set spoilers for glide path & 
angle of descent.  Encountered heavy sink, CDIT [controlled descent into terrain]."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
