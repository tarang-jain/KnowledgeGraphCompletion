Factual Information
 On July 1, 2000, about 1315 hours Pacific daylight time, an experimental Kashan Berkut 540, 
N600SE, sustained substantial damage when it rolled over and touched down inverted during 
landing at Hayden Field, Jackpot, Nevada.  The private pilot operated the borrowed airplane 
under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91.  The pilot and one passenger sustained serious injuries.  
The local personal flight, which was participating in an experimental airplane fly-in, departed 
Jackpot at an unknown time.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan 
had been filed.
The pilot told a Sheriff's deputy the wind flipped him over when he was on short final.  The 
pilot of the airplane ahead of the accident airplane told the deputy he observed numerous dust 
devils and gusty winds in the airport vicinity and broadcast an advisory about the conditions.  
The deputy said thunderstorms were in the area, and the winds were 10 to 15 knots and 
swirling.  
A Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report, Form 6120.1/2, was sent via certified mail and not 
returned.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
