Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
GODLEY, TX
Accident Number:
FTW00LA191
Date & Time:
07/01/2000, 1630 CDT 
Registration:
N231RR
Aircraft:
Mooney M20K
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot, who is also an aircraft mechanic, had just completed a 100-hour inspection on his 
airplane, and he inadvertently left the magneto P-leads disconnected.  While in cruise flight, 
the engine lost power, and the pilot made a successful emergency landing in a field.  The pilot 
stated that he reconnected the P-leads, checked the magnetos, and attempted a takeoff from 
the field.  He stated that the acceleration was 'normal;' however, when the airplane lifted off of 
the ground it 'skipped and settled two or three times.'  The pilot aborted the takeoff 'too late to 
keep from plowing through some small trees.'  The pilot stated that he misjudged the distance 
required to takeoff from the soft field. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate preflight planning and his delay in aborting the takeoff. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: ON GROUND/WATER COLLISION WITH OBJECT
Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - ABORTED
Findings
1. OBJECT - TREE(S)
2. (C) PREFLIGHT PLANNING/PREPARATION - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND
3. (C) ABORTED TAKEOFF - DELAYED - PILOT IN COMMAND

Factual Information
 On July 1, 2000, at 1630 central daylight time, a Mooney M20K airplane, N231RR, was 
substantially damaged when it impacted a fence and trees during takeoff from a field near 
Godley, Texas.  The commercial pilot, who was the registered owner of the airplane and the 
sole occupant, received minor injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight 
plan was not filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.  The flight 
originated from Cleburne, Texas, at 1600, and was destined for Fort Worth, Texas.
According to a written statement provided by the pilot, who is also an aircraft mechanic, he had 
just completed a 100-hour inspection on his airplane and "inadvertently left the magneto 'P' 
leads disconnected after the mag[neto] check."  The pilot stated that he experienced a loss of 
engine power while en route to Fort Worth and performed a successful emergency landing in a 
field.  The pilot stated that he "reconnected the 'P' leads, checked the mag[netos] and 
attempted a takeoff-estimating that I had plenty of takeoff distance."  He reported that the 
wind was calm and the fuel tanks were almost full.  He added that the ground was slightly soft.  
The pilot stated that the acceleration was "normal;" however, when the airplane lifted off of the 
ground it "skipped and settled two or three times."  The pilot aborted the takeoff "too late to 
keep from plowing through some small trees."  The pilot reported that he "misjudged the 
distance required on the (slightly) soft field."  The FAA inspector stated that the left wing was 
separated from the airplane and the right wing was structurally damaged.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
