Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
PALO ALTO, CA
Accident Number:
LAX00LA086
Date & Time:
02/02/2000, 1437 PST 
Registration:
N999EV
Aircraft:
Robinson R44
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot and passenger were inbound to land and the pilot requested permission to perform 
an autorotation, which was approved.  The pilot reported that he did not think he was going to 
reach the runway during the autorotation so he added power.  The engine failed to respond and 
the tail stinger contacted the ground resulting in the separation of the tail boom.  The pilot 
pulled collective pitch; the helicopter briefly became airborne, and spun violently to the right.  
The pilot maintained a level attitude and the helicopter landed hard.  After the rotor stopped, 
they exited the helicopter.  The pilot stated that he should have used carburetor heat prior to 
the extended engine idle period of the autorotation.  The temperature and dew point were in 
the serious icing-glide power range. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to use carburetor heat, resulting in a loss of engine power, and, his 
misjudged autorotation approach that resulted in a collision with the ground during the 
landing flare.  Contributing to the accident was the conditions conducive to carburetor icing.

Factual Information
 On February 2, 2000, at 1437 hours Pacific standard time, a Robinson R44, helicopter, 
N999EV, was substantially damaged during a practice autorotation at Palo Alto, California.  
Neither the commercial rated pilot nor the passenger was injured.  The personal flight was 
operated by the pilot under 14 CFR Part 91.  No flight plan was filed.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed for the operation that originated at San Carlos, California, at 1427. 
The pilot reported that during the autorotation the engine had been at idle for an extended 
period.  He said he did not think he was going to make the runway so he added power.  The 
engine failed to respond and the tail stinger contacted the ground, resulting in the separation 
of the tail boom.  The pilot pulled collective pitch; the helicopter briefly became airborne and 
spun violently to the right.  The pilot maintained the helicopter in a level attitude and the 
landed hard.  After the main rotor stopped rotating, the pilot and passenger exited the 
helicopter.  
The pilot told the Federal Aviation Administration inspector on scene that he did not use 
carburetor heat during the autorotation.  According to the Palo Alto METAR, the temperature 
was 64 degrees Fahrenheit and the dew point was 52 degrees Fahrenheit.  Reference to a 
carburetor icing probability chart revealed that this temperature and dew point were in an area 
of the graph annotated "moderate icing-cruise power or serious icing-glide power."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
