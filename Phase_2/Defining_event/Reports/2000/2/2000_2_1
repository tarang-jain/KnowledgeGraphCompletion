Analysis 
The flight instructor stated that they were planning to practice touch-and go landings.  The 
student pilot had already performed one touch-and-go, which the flight instructor described as 
'normal.'  According to the flight instructor, during the accident sequence, the airplane had 
already touched down when it suddenly veered off to the left side of the runway.  He said he 
took control of the airplane, but before he could regain directional control, it struck a series of 
three taxiway signs, resulting in substantial damage to the left wing and collapsing the left 
landing gear.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
