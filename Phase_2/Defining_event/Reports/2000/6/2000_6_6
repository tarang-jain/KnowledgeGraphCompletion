Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot stated that he had been on an aerial application flight, spraying fertilizer on local 
fields.  He had applied 18 loads and was returning to pick up his 19th load of fertilizer.  During 
the landing roll on the grass airstrip, 'the aircraft started turning right and ground looped 
before [he] corrected directional control.'  The main landing gear collapsed, the fuel tank 
ruptured, and a fire erupted, which consumed the airplane.  The pilot reported that the airstrip 
was oriented north-south, and there was a 10-12 mph crosswind from the east at the time of the 
accident. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the pilot to maintain directional control during the landing roll, which resulted in 
a ground loop.  A factor was the crosswind. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - ON GROUND/WATER
Phase of Operation: LANDING - ROLL
Findings
1. (F) WEATHER CONDITION - CROSSWIND
2. (C) DIRECTIONAL CONTROL - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND
3. GROUND LOOP/SWERVE - ENCOUNTERED - PILOT IN COMMAND

Factual Information
 On June 1, 2000, at 1500 central daylight time, a Grumman-Schweizer G164B agricultural 
airplane, N48723, was destroyed when it ground looped during landing roll on a private grass 
airstrip near Natchitoches, Louisiana.  The airplane was owned and operated by Valley Air, 
Inc., of Natchitoches, Louisiana.  The commercial pilot, sole occupant, was not injured.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight, and a flight plan was not filed.  The 14 
Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 aerial application flight originated approximately 1445.
The pilot stated that he had been on an aerial application flight, spraying fertilizer on local 
fields.  He had applied 18 loads and was returning to pick up his 19th load of fertilizer.  The 
pilot stated that during the landing roll, "the aircraft started turning right and ground looped 
before [he] corrected directional control."  The main landing gear collapsed, the fuel tank 
ruptured, and a fire erupted.  The pilot reported the airstrip was oriented north-south, and 
there was a 10-12 mph crosswind from the east at the time of the accident.    
The cockpit, fuselage, horizontal stabilizer, and vertical stabilizer were consumed by the fire.  
The cabane struts were structurally damaged, which resulted in the top wing collapsing and 
coming to rest on the forward part of the fuselage.  The three-bladed propeller and radial 
engine remained attached to the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
