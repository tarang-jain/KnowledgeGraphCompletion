Analysis 
The commercial pilot had dispensed his 4th load of fertilizer for the day and was returning to 
the airstrip, when he reported a vibration, followed by a loss of engine power.  During the 
forced landing, another pilot observed the airplane hit a ditch between two rice fields, and then 
nose over.  The integrity of the fuel system was not compromised during the impact sequence.  
There was no evidence of fuel found at the accident site during an examination the day after 
the accident.  Fuel stains were found on the bottom of the right wing.  During an engine test 
run, the engine ran rough, backfiring, and cutting out momentarily throughout the normal 
power range.  When the engine was run at power, on only the left magneto, the engine 
maintained 28 inches of manifold pressure at 2,000 RPM; however, it would still cut out from 
time to time.  Removal and examination of the right magneto revealed that the internal brass 
gear splines were worn and brass particles were scattered within the magneto.  Removal, bench 
testing, and examination of the carburetor revealed that the float movement was rough, the 
orifice of the float valve was too large, the float was set too low, and the accelerator pump did 
not work well.  The carburetor had been removed, overhauled, reinstalled, and returned to 
service approximately 3 weeks prior to the accident.  The seat belt and shoulder harness were 
found fastened, and the pilot was wearing his helmet.  The curved overturn tube, located in the 
upper portion of the cockpit, was crushed inward.  According to the manufacturer 
representative, a service bulletin was issued on March 23, 1991, for the installation of a cockpit 
overturn skid plate as an added safety feature.  The skid plate had not been installed in the 
accident aircraft. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the loss of engine power in cruise flight as a result of the failure of the right magneto.  A 
contributing factor was the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On June 1, 2000, at 1920 central daylight time, an Air Tractor AT-301 agricultural airplane, 
N8886S, impacted the terrain during a forced landing following a loss of engine power near 
Garwood, Texas.  The airplane, owned by ANF Air Service, Inc., of Garwood, Texas, was 
operated under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137.  The commercial pilot, sole occupant, 
was fatally injured, and the airplane sustained substantial damage.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed for the aerial application flight, and a flight plan was not filed.  The local 
flight originated from a private turf airstrip approximately 30-45 minutes prior to the accident.
The pilot had dispensed his last load of fertilizer for the day on the rice field and was returning 
to the airstrip, when he radioed to the pilot of another aircraft that his airplane was vibrating, 
but he had full engine power.  The other pilot observed N8886S at 150-100 feet agl on a 
southwest heading.  This pilot flew his airplane past N8886S however, he did not see anything 
loose on the airplane.  He told the pilot of N8886S that there was a farm strip about 1 1/2 miles 
west of his position.  The pilot of N8886S responded that he "would make it back to the home 
strip."  About 15 seconds later, the pilot of N8886S radioed "it quit."  The pilot of the other 
aircraft observed N8886S descend at a 15-20 degree attitude with the wings level.  The airplane 
(N8886S) hit a ditch between two rice fields.  The airplane "hit the ditch engine first and 
turned over."  The observing pilot reported clear skies with unlimited visibility and a southwest 
wind of 8 knots.
According to the operator, this was the pilot's fourth aerial application flight of the day in 
N8886S.  The operator did not maintain refueling records for the aircraft.  The fueling 
personnel recalled having fueled the aircraft during the day; however, they did not recall the 
time of the last refueling.  
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
The FAA pilot records, reviewed by the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC), revealed the pilot 
was issued his private pilot certificate in 1956, with the airplane single-engine land rating.  In 
October 1957, the certificate was upgraded to a commercial pilot certificate.  In April 1958, the 
pilot was issued a limited flight instructor certificate single-engine land rating.  In February 
1969, the multiengine airplane rating was added to the pilot's commercial certificate, and in 
November 1970, he added the instrument rating.  The pilot obtained his airplane single-engine 
seaplane rating in August 1971.  In February 1973, the pilot obtained a type rating in the 
Lockheed L-18 airplane.  On October 14, 1969, the pilot was issued a mechanic certificate with 
airframe and powerplant ratings.  
The records submitted by the operator, indicated that the pilot's total accumulated time was 
30,335.8 flight hours, of which 26,844.9 hours were in single-engine land airplanes.  The pilot 
held a second class medical certificate issued January 27, 2000, with the limitation "must wear 
corrective lenses when flying."  The pilot's last biennial flight review was performed on January 
28, 2000, in a Cessna 172 single-engine airplane.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
A review of the aircraft records, by the NTSB IIC, revealed the airplane, model AT-301, serial 
number 301-0227, was manufactured in 1979 by Air Tractor, Inc, with a P & W, R1340-AN-1, 
Page 4 of 8FTW00LA168
radial engine installed.  The FAA airworthiness certificate was issued October 11, 1979.  The 
aircraft was registered to the current owner on March 11, 1996.  
A SATLOC Global Positioning System (GPS) was installed in January 1996.  In February 1998, 
the Hamilton Standard propeller, 12D40610A-12, serial number H7691, was overhauled and 
installed on the engine.  In March 1999, the P & W engine, R1340-AN-1, serial number ZP-
102091, was disassembled due to a propeller strike, inspected, repaired, test run for 2 hours, 
and returned to service.   All flight controls were removed and all flight control hardware 
replaced in April 1999.  The left magneto, a Bendix type SB9RN, serial number DC005208, was 
removed and replaced with an overhauled magneto, serial number 132348, on April 26, 2000.  
The Bendix carburetor model NAY9E1, serial number 5831479, was removed, overhauled, and 
returned to service on May 8, 2000.  
On March 20, 2000, the last 100-hour inspection was performed on the engine at an 
accumulated time of 1,425.0 flight hours since its last overhaul.  The last annual inspection was 
performed on March 20, 2000, at an accumulated aircraft time of 7,912.7 flight hours.  
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The FAA inspectors and the aircraft manufacturer's representative, who responded to the 
accident site (29.26.1343 degrees North 096.29.1052 degrees West) on the day after the 
accident, found the airplane resting inverted approximately 50 feet southwest of a pond.  There 
were tire tracks found in the water on the southwest edge of the pond, and ground scars 
extended from the pond to a 3-foot dirt mound.  The nose of the airplane was about 10 feet 
beyond the dirt mound.  The vertical stabilizer and rudder were structurally damaged.  
The engine and propeller were found attached to the engine mount that remained attached to 
the airframe.  The propeller blades were bent aft.  
Flight control continuity was confirmed.  
The FAA inspector reported that he opened a fuel line to the engine and found no fuel in the 
line.  There was no evidence of fuel found at the accident site.  He noted evidence of fuel stains 
on the bottom surface of the right wing.  The integrity of the fuel system was not compromised 
during the impact sequence.  
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
An autopsy was performed by the Office of the Medical Examiner of Travis County, Austin, 
Texas.  
The aviation toxicology tests were performed by the FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute's (CAMI) 
Forensic Toxicological and Accident Research Center.  The CAMI toxicological findings were 
negative.  
SURVIVAL ASPECTS
The seat belt and shoulder harness were found fastened.  The pilot was wearing his helmet.  
The curved overturn tube, located in the upper portion of the cockpit, was crushed inward.  
According to the manufacturer representative, Air Tractor, Inc., Service Bulletin 97 was issued 
on March 23, 1991, for the installation of a cockpit overturn skid plate as an added safety 
feature.  The skid plate had not been installed in the accident aircraft.     
TEST AND RESEARCH
Page 5 of 8FTW00LA168
On July 21, 2000, under the supervision of the NTSB IIC, a new propeller was installed on the 
engine at the facilities of Air Salvage of Dallas in Lancaster, Texas, for an engine run.  The 
engine remained mounted to the airframe and a temporary fuel supply was plumbed to the 
header tank.  The battery was charged and connected to the airframe battery cables.  The 
wobble pump was operated and fuel was delivered to the carburetor.  The primer and throttle 
were pumped and the engine cranked with the electric starter.  The engine started and ran at 
idle.  A magneto check at 1,800 RPMs revealed zero drop on the left magneto, and the engine 
cut out on the right.  The cockpit controls were checked for proper installation.  The engine was 
run at various power settings for 20 minutes.  The engine ran rough, backfiring, and cutting 
out momentarily throughout the normal power range.  When the engine was run on only the 
left magneto, the engine maintained 28 inches of manifold pressure at 2,000 RPM's however, 
it would still cut out from time to time. 
The right magneto, Bendix type SB9RN, specification 28159-C, part number 24953-3, serial 
number DC012807, was removed from the engine.  The internal brass gear splines were worn 
and brass particles were scattered within the magneto.
On August 9, 2000, under the supervision of an FAA inspector, the Bendix carburetor, model 
NAY9E1, serial number 5831479, which had been removed from the engine, was examined.  
When the carburetor was placed on the test bench, the test bench was turned on, and the fuel 
pressure was set at 4.5 psi to the carburetor.  According to the FAA inspector, there was "very 
little fuel flow when the throttle controls were manipulated, [and] it appeared that the 
accelerator pump was non-functioning."  Subsequently, the carburetor was removed from the 
test bench, the top cover was removed from the carburetor, and the carburetor was placed back 
on the test bench.  The carburetor "float was stuck down and did not release" until the "float 
was tapped."  The accelerator pump "started working, but not well."  
The carburetor was removed from the test bench for further teardown.  The FAA inspector 
reported that "the fulcrum shaft attaching the float was stiff in the housing."  According to the 
FAA inspector, this "caused the float movement to be rough."  The float level was checked 
against the maintenance manual.  The acceptable limits for the float level are 1/4th +/- 1/64th 
inch.  The float level was found at a 23/64-inch setting.  According to the FAA inspector, this 
measurement is "significantly higher than the acceptable limits in the maintenance manual."  
The FAA inspector found that the float valve, part number P60064-1605, was incorrect for this 
part number carburetor.  The installed float valve is dimensionally the same as the proper 
valve, part number P21260-998 (orifice size 998); however, the orifice size on the installed 
valve was found to be 1605, a larger size orifice.  According to the FAA inspector, with the 
"larger orifice size, the installed float valve would allow more fuel flow than that for the 
approved float valve."    
ADDITIONAL DATA
The SatLoc GPS system, serial number AS9612121953, was examined for flight data.  According 
to the manufacturer, there was no data recorded for the flights conducted on the day of the 
accident.
The airplane was released to the owner's representative.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
