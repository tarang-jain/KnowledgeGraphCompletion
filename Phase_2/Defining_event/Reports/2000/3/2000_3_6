Analysis 
According to witnesses at the accident site, the airplane was about 80 feet above the runway, 
on final approach to land, when it suddenly nosed into the ground. Both witnesses reported 
that the engine appeared to have been operating prior to impact. The toxicology report 
indicated that propoxyphene,  amitriptyline, and a high level of diphenhydramine were found 
in the pilot's blood. Propoxyphene is a prescription narcotic painkiller  known to impair 
cognitive performance. Amitriptyline is a sedating antidepressant.  Diphenhydramine is an 
over-the-counter sedating antihistamine.  The pilot had no current FAA medical certificate.

Factual Information
On March 3, 2000, at 1720 eastern standard time, an unregistered experimental airplane, 
collided with the ground while attempting a landing on runway 27 at Redder Airport in 
Manatee, Florida. The personal flight was operated by the pilot under the provisions of Title 14 
CFR Part 91 with no flight plan filed. Visual weather conditions prevailed at the time of the 
accident. The airplane sustained substantial damage, and the private pilot received fatal 
injuries. The flight departed Manatee, Florida, at an undetermined time. 
According to witnesses at the accident site, the airplane was about 80 feet above the runway, 
on final approach to land, when it suddenly nosed into the ground. Both witnesses reported 
that the engine appeared to have been operating prior to impact.
On March 4, 2000, the postmortem examination on the pilot was performed at the Office of 
the District Twelve Medical Examiner, Sarasota, Florida. The toxicology report indicated that 
propoxyphene, a prescription narcotic painkiller often known by the trade name Darvon, 
norpropoxyphene, a metabolite of propoxyphene, amitriptyline, a prescription antidepressant, 
its active metabolite nortriptylene, and diphenhydramine, an over-the-counter sedating 
antihistamine,  were found in the pilot's blood and urine. 
The FAA does not regulate the use of any specific prescription or over-the-counter medications 
by pilots, though the FARs do state that (Sec. 91.17): "No person may act or attempt to act as a 
crewmember of a civil aircraft ... While using any drug that affects the person's faculties in any 
way contrary to safety...." The pilot had no current FAA medical certificate. The pilot's personal 
medical history was not acquired for examination.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
