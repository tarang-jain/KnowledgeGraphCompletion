Factual Information
 On October 2, 1997, at 1520 central daylight time, a Cessna A185F, N105NR, received 
substantial damage during a ground loop on landing at Roseau Municipal Airport, near

use flight was for the purpose of surveying migratory waterfowl.  The flight departed Bimidji at 
1300, with a planned intermediate stop at Roseau for fuel.  The final leg of the flight was a 
planned return to Bimidji.  The flight was conducted in visual meteorological conditions.  No 
flight plan was on file.
The pilot stated that the wind was from 070 at 7 knots.  He landed the airplane on runway 34

continued through a ground loop when the airplane exited the runway and the left main 
landing gear collapsed.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
