Location:
HOLLYWOOD, FL
Accident Number:
MIA97LA177
Date & Time:
06/01/1997, 1256 EDT 
Registration:
N7393C
Aircraft:
Cessna T-210-N
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot stated that while on downwind for landing, he lowered the flaps to 10 degrees and 
extended the landing gear. As he turned on base leg, he noticed the radios were not working 
and the electrical system ammeter was showing the system was not charging. On final 
approach, he noticed the landing gear extended light was very dim, and there was no change 
when he pushed it for test. During the landing rollout, the left main landing gear collapsed. 
Postcrash examination showed the battery was discharged, there was corrosion on all of the 
landing gear components, and the gear warning horn was operating intermittently. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
failure of the pilot to ensure the landing gear was locked down before landing, following an 
electrical system failure, resulting in the left main landing gear collapsing during landing 
rollout.  The electrical malfunction and resultant discharged battery were related factors.

Factual Information
 On June 1, 1997, about 1256 eastern daylight time, a Cessna T210N, N7393C, registered 
to a private owner, had the left main landing gear collapse during landing rollout at North 
Perry Airport, Hollywood, Florida, while on a Title 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed.  The airplane 
sustained substantial damage.  The commercial-rated pilot and airline transport-rated 
passenger reported no injuries.  The flight had last departed from Hollywood, Florida, the same 
day, about 1250.
The pilot stated that while on the downwind leg for landing on runway 18 left, he 
lowered the flaps to 10 degrees and extended the landing gear. As he turned on base leg he 
noticed the radios were not working and the electrical system amp meter was showing the 
system was not charging. He used a hand held radio to communicate with the control tower 
and extended his downwind leg. He complied with the low voltage emergency procedures. As 
he turned final he checked the landing gear green light. It appeared dim and when he tested it, 
it did not change. He then called for a visual inspection of the landing gear. Landing and 
rollout were normal until the aircraft slowed to about 15 knots. While applying brakes the left 
main landing gear collapsed.
Postaccident testing of the aircraft's landing gear system was performed by an FAA 
inspector. A fully charged battery was installed in the aircraft and the aircraft was placed on 
jacks. The left main landing gear uplock was found to have paint scrapped off the inboard side. 
The landing gear appeared to be out of rig. Corrosion was present on all components of the 
landing gear. The landing gear was retracted and left main landing gear hung momentarily 
before locking on the uplock. The landing gear extension was normal. The landing gear 
warning horn was found to operate intermittently. (See FAA inspector statement).

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
