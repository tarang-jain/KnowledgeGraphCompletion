Location:
MOKULEIA, HI
Accident Number:
LAX97LA139
Date & Time:
04/01/1997, 1212 HST 
Registration:
N3652U
Aircraft:
Cessna 182F
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
5 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Other Work Use
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, before takeoff with the four parachutists, he had checked the flight 
controls and no evidence of any mechanical problems was noted.  During the takeoff roll the 
airplane accelerated between 60 and 65 mph, became airborne and pitched 60 degrees nose 
up.  The pilot further reported that he applied forward pressure on the control yoke, but there 
was no response.  The airplane banked right, stalled, descended, and collided with trees.  The 
pilot further reported that he notified the Unicom operator he was 'coming back around.'  
However, the control yoke was still 'frozen in position' and could not be moved forward or aft.  
The airplane's pitch could not be controlled, and the airplane descended into the water and 
sank.  The main wreckage was not recovered.  The pilot's report of a jammed yoke could not be 
verified due to the lack of physical evidence. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
An unintentional stall for undetermined reasons.

Factual Information
 On April 1, 1997, at 1212 hours Hawaiian standard time, a Cessna 182F, N3652U, operated by 
the Skydive Academy of Hawaii Corporation, experienced an in-flight loss of control during 
takeoff from runway 26 at the Dillingham Airfield, Mokuleia, Hawaii.  Witnesses reported 
observing the airplane lift off and immediately thereafter commence climbing at a steep angle.  
Within several hundred feet above ground level, one wing suddenly lowered and the airplane 
rapidly lost altitude.  The airplane collided with trees, impacted the Mokuleia Beach Park surf, 
and was destroyed upon sinking in 15-feet-deep water near the shoreline.  The commercial 
pilot and four passengers, which were being transported for a planned parachute jump, 
sustained minor injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was 
filed.  The flight was originating at the time of the accident.  
In brief, the pilot reported in his completed Aircraft Accident Report that before takeoff he had 
checked the flight controls, and no evidence of any mechanical problems was noted.  During 
the takeoff roll the airplane accelerated between 60 and 65 mph.  The airplane became 
airborne and pitched 60 degrees nose up.  Forward pressure was applied on the control yoke, 
but there was no response.  The airplane banked right and stalled, and the nose lowered.  
Thereafter, the airplane collided with trees which shattered the windshield, and an oil leak 
developed.  The pilot further reported that he notified the Unicom operator he was "coming 
back around."  However, the control yoke was still "frozen in position" and could not be moved 
forward or aft.  The airplane's pitch could not be controlled, and the airplane descended into 
the water.
Interviews were conducted with the passengers and ground-based witnesses.  No information 
was found to indicate that the pilot had planned to make a short field takeoff or had 
intentionally climbed at a steep angle.    
The Federal Aviation Administration's Safety Data Analysis Section in Oklahoma City, 
Oklahoma, searched its data base of Service Difficulty Reports (SDRs) for elevator control 
binding events involving Cessna 182 series airplanes.  None was found during the search 
period between 1990 and April, 1997. 
The airplane's main wreckage was not recovered.  The pilot's report of a jammed yoke was not 
verified with physical evidence.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
