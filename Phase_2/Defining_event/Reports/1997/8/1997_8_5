Factual Information
 On August 1, 1997, at approximately 1000 central daylight time (cdt), a Maule M-4-220C, 
N40354, operated by a private pilot collided with the terrain following a loss of control while 
landing on runway 25 (5,699' x 150') at the Beltrami County Airport, Bemidji, Minnesota.  The 
personal 14 CFR Part 91 flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions without a 
flight plan.  The airplane was substantially damaged.  The pilot and two passengers were not 
injured. The flight originated from New Richmond, Wisconsin, at 0800 central daylight time.
The pilot reported that everything was normal as he entered the traffic pattern and set up to 
land.  He continued to report, "Flared at correct position, cut throttle glided down runway 25 
touchdown normal."  The pilot reported that after a ground roll of 100 to 175 feet the airplane 
"veered to right instantly & ended up on left wingtip with left gear collapsed 1/2 in grass on 
right side of 25."  The pilot reported that he had not used the brakes during the landing roll; 
however, skid marks from the right main landing gear were visible on the runway.  
The accident was not reported to the National Transportation Safety Board until August 14, 
1997.  Inspection of the brakes failed to reveal any failure/malfunction.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
