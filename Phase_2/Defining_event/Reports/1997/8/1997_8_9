Registration:
N93011
Aircraft:
Cessna 152

Destroyed
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The pilot was in cruise flight between 1,000 feet to 1,200 feet when he experienced a partial 
loss of engine power followed by a total loss of engine power. He made a forced landing to the 
only available forced landing area which was nonsuitable. The airplane collided with wires and 
terrain and a postcrash fire ensued. Examination of the airframe and flight controls revealed 
no evidence of a precrash mechanical failure or malfunction. Disassembly of the engine 
assembly revealed no precrash anomalies or discrepancies that would indicate the engine was 
not capable of running and producing power before the accident. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Loss of engine power for undetermined reasons resulting in a forced landing to unsuitable 
terrain.

Factual Information
 On August 1, 1997, about 0802 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 152, N93011, registered 
to Alternative Flying Club Inc., operated by Fort Myers Airways, as a 14 CFR Part 91 
instructional flight, experienced a reported loss of engine power in cruise flight, and crashed 
during a forced landing in the vicinity of Cape Coral, Florida. Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The airplane was destroyed by a postcrash fire. The 
student pilot reported no injuries. The flight originated from  Page Field, Fort Myers, Florida, 
about 42 minutes before the accident. 
According to personnel on duty at Page Field Control Tower N93011 departed from  
runway 5 at about 0720. At about 0801, the pilot informed them that he was 5 miles south of 
the airport and seemed to be losing power. The tower operator asked the pilot to ident on the 
transponder, and asked what was the nature of his emergency. The pilot stated he was losing 
power and altitude. The pilot was instructed to proceed direct to the airport and asked to verify 
that he did not have an instructor pilot on board the airplane. The pilot stated at 0801:59, "I 
dont have an instructor, " followed by " 011 I dont know." There was no other recorded 
conversation with the pilot.
Examination of the airframe and flight control system revealed no evidence of a 
precrash mechanical failure or malfunction. Continuity of the flight control system was 
confirmed for pitch, roll, and yaw.
The engine assembly was shipped to the engine manufacture for further examination in 
the presence of the FAA. Textron Lycoming concluded that, "The engine disassembly did not 
reveal any precrash anomalies or discrepancies that would indicate that this engine was not 
capable of running and producing power prior to the accident." For additional information see 
Textron Lycoming Accident Investigation Engine Disassembly Report.
The engine assembly and accessories were released to Mr. Donald Carter, President,  
Alternate Flying Club Inc., on September 30, 1997.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
