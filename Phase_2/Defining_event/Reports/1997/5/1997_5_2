Location:
RUSSELLVILLE, AL
Accident Number:
ATL97LA066
Date & Time:
05/01/1997, 1100 CDT 
Registration:
N5778Z
Aircraft:
Piper PA-22-180
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
Approximately 4 hours into the flight, while on a long descent to the destination airport, the 
pilot experienced a reduction in engine power. The power reduction continued over a period of 
eight minutes and resulted in a complete loss of engine power. Following the loss of power, the 
pilot's attempts to restore full engine power, which included the application of carburetor heat, 
failed. The pilot selected a nearby paved road for an emergency landing. During the landing roll 
out, the right wing collided with a road sign, and the airplane swerved  into an adjacent ditch 
and nosed over. Examination of the airplane failed to disclose a mechanical problem. Fuel was 
recovered from the fuel system. During the  functional test of the engine, the engine operated 
normally through all power ranges. A review of current weather information revealed that 
weather conditions were favorable for the formation of carburetor icing. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons. A factor was conditions were favorable for 
the formation of carburetor ice.

Factual Information
 On May 1, 1997, at 1100 central daylight time, a Piper PA-28-180, N5778Z, collided with a road 
sign during an emergency landing roll, and nosed over into a ditch five miles west of  
Russellville, Alabama. The personal flight operated under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91 
with a flight plan filed. Visual weather conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The 
airplane sustained substantial damage; the pilot was not injured. The flight departed Quincy, 
Louisiana, at 0700. 
According to the pilot, approximately four hours into the flight, while on a long descent to 
Muscle Shoals, Alabama, he experienced a reduction in engine power. The power reduction 
continued over a period of eight minutes and resulted in a complete loss of engine power. 
Following the loss of power, the pilot's attempts to restore full engine power, which included 
the application of carburetor heat, failed. The pilot selected a nearby paved road for an 
emergency landing. During the landing roll out, the right wing collided with a road sign, and 
the airplane swerved into an adjacent ditch and nosed over.
During the examination of the airplane approximately twelve gallons of fuel were recovered 
from the fuel system. During the  functional test of the engine, the engine operated normally 
through all power ranges. A review of current weather information revealed that weather 
conditions were favorable for the formation of carburetor icing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
