Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
CLERMONT, FL
Accident Number:
MIA98LA018
Date & Time:
11/01/1997, 1548 EST 
Registration:
N813LJ
Aircraft:
Saldairiaga BUCCANEER II
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
Witnesses stated they observed the airplane start a steep left turn, estimated more than a 45 
degree angle of bank, between 150 to 300 feet at a slow airspeed. The airplane appeared to 
enter an accelerated stall. The nose pitched down,  and the airplane collided with the ground in 
a left wing low, nose-down attitude. Before the airplane collided with the ground, the engine 
was heard to increase to full power. Examination of the airframe and flight control assembly 
revealed no evidence of a precrash mechanical failure or malfunction. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
failure of the pilot to maintain adequate airspeed, while maneuvering at a low altitude, which 
resulted in an inadvertent stall and subsequent in-flight collision with terrain. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - IN FLIGHT
Phase of Operation: MANEUVERING
Findings
1. MANEUVER - INITIATED - PILOT IN COMMAND
2. (C) AIRSPEED - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND
3. (C) STALL - INADVERTENT - PILOT IN COMMAND

Factual Information
 On November 1, 1997, about 1548 eastern standard time, a Saldairiaga, Buccaneer II, 
N813LJ, operated by a private owner as a 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight, crashed in the vicinity 
of Clermont, Florida. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. 
The airplane was destroyed. The student pilot was fatally injured. The flight originated from 
Flying Gator Airpark, Clermont, Florida, about 1 hour 18 minutes before the accident.
Witnesses who knew the pilot stated they observed the airplane between 150 to 300 feet 
southwest of the airpark. The airplane entered a steep left turn, estimated more than a 45-
degree angle of bank at a slow airspeed. The airplane  appeared to enter an accelerated stall. 
The nose pitched down and the airplane collided with the ground in a left wing low nose-down 
attitude. Before the airplane collided with the ground the engine was heard to increase to full 
power.
Examination of the airframe, flight control system and engine assembly revealed no 
evidence of a precrash mechanical failure or malfunction. All components necessary for flight 
were present at the crash site. Continuity of the flight control system was confirmed for pitch, 
roll, and yaw. An examination of the engine assembly and accessories was not conducted based 
on statements provided by eyewitnesses indicating the engine was operating at time of impact 
with the terrain.
Postmortem examination of the pilot was conducted by Dr. Susan M. Rendon, Associate 
Medical Examiner District Five, Leesburg, Florida, on November 2, 1997. The cause of death 
was injuries related to the aircraft accident. Postmortem toxicology studies of specimens from 
the pilot was performed by the Forensic Toxicology Research Section, Federal Aviation 
Administration, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. These studies were negative for alcohol, basic, 
acidic and neutral drugs.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
