Analysis   
The pilot reported that he was flying a tail-wheel equipped airplane and conducting his second 
landing at a back country airstrip. During the landing flare, the airplane floated longer than 
expected and was starting to drift to the left side of the runway. The pilot added full power to 
go around when the left main landing gear struck a bush and the airplane turned sideways. The 
right landing gear collapsed and the right wing was substantially damaged when it struck the 
ground. The pilot reported that after exiting the airplane he noticed that the wind was a gusting 
right quartering tailwind. The pilot reported no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operations.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s failure to maintain aircraft control during the landing flare with a quartering 
tailwind.
Findings
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Instructor/check pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Tailwind - Effect on operation

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=87062
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
