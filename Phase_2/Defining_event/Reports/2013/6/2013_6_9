Registration:
N650VX
Aircraft:
BEECH A23-24
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that while flying with a certified flight instructor (CFI) for his biannual 
review, they were simulating an engine failure over the airport with the intent to land on the 
runway. After spiraling to traffic pattern altitude, the pilot entered a downwind leg for the 
runway. The pilot turned towards the runway and inadvertently stalled the airplane about 200 
feet above the ground. The CFI took over the flight controls; the airplane struck the ground 
hard, broke off the right main landing gear, and bounced back into the air. The CFI climbed to 
a safe altitude and circled above the airport before conducting an uneventful landing onto the 
grass next to the runway. During the accident sequence, the right wing sustained substantial 
damage. The pilot reported no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or engine 
that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s failure to maintain airplane control and the flight instructors failure to monitor the 
pilot during a simulated emergency landing.
Findings
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Monitoring other person - Instructor/check pilot (Cause)

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=87086
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
