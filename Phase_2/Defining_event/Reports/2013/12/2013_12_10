12/04/2013, 1225 AST 
Registration:

BELLANCA 7GCBC
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Structural icing

2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The uncertificated student pilot stated that he had been watching the weather for three days 
waiting for suitable flying conditions. He checked the automated weather at a nearby airport, 
and decided that conditions were suitable for flying. He and a passenger then took off on a 
cross-country flight. During the climb to cruise altitude, the uncertificated student pilot  began 
to notice specks of ice on the windscreen. A short time later, ice suddenly began to accumulate 
rapidly on the airplane, obscuring the windscreen. He could see an airstrip ahead and to the 
left of the airplane, and started a rapid descent to set up for a landing. As he approached the 
airstrip, he said that he was still too fast and too high to attempt a landing, so he initiated a go-
around. During the second landing attempt, he said that the airplane felt very heavy and 
sluggish, and as he began to slowly decrease the throttle on the landing approach, the airplane 
began to lose altitude very fast. He attempted a second go-around, but the engine backfired and 
lost power. He landed the airplane just past the end of the airstrip on a dirt road, but the right 
wing struck a power line guy wire, and the airplane spun to the right, striking a road sign. The 
airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing and empennage. The pilot stated that 
there were no preaccident mechanical anomalies with the airplane that would have precluded 
normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The operation of the airplane by the uncertificated student pilot, his failure to recognize 
conditions conducive to structural icing, and subsequent decision to depart in conditions 
conducive to structural icing, resulting in a severe icing encounter and forced landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
