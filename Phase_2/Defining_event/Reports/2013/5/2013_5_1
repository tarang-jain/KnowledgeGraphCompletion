Location:
Ingalls, IN
Accident Number:
CEN13CA250
Date & Time:
05/01/2013, 0830 EDT 
Registration:
N1568Y
Aircraft:
BEECH A36
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot departed on a 1 hour 50 minute cross country flight with about 30 gallons of fuel in 
each wing tank (about 27 gallons usable fuel per side). The flight was uneventful until the pilot 
started a descent from 8,000 feet to 3,000 feet; the engine then made "two pops" and "quit." 
The pilot said the engine didn™t run rough; "it just stopped." He made several attempts to re-
start the engine but was unsuccessful. The pilot declared an emergency and landed in a field. 
Upon landing, the nose gear dug into the dirt and separated from the airplane. The right wing 
rear spar fractured during the landing; however, both wing fuel tanks were undamaged. About 
1 quart of fuel was drained from the left wing tank, and the right wing tank contained about 30 
gallons of fuel. The pilot could not recall where the fuel selector was positioned at the time of 
the power loss. Examination of the engine and fuel system revealed no mechanical anomalies 
that would have precluded normal operation. It is likely that the pilot was feeding fuel to the 
engine from the left wing tank and did not switch to the right wing tank before the engine lost 
power or during the attempted restart.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper fuel management, which resulted in a loss of engine power due to fuel 
starvation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
