Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
West Yellowstone, MT
Accident Number:
WPR13CA362
Date & Time:
08/01/2013, 0720 MDT 
Registration:
N926BW
Aircraft:
BELLANCA 7GCBC
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot and the pilot-rated passenger planned to conduct a personal flight in the tailwheel-
equipped airplane. The pilot was in the rear seat, and the passenger was in the front seat. The 
passenger did not have a tailwheel endorsement, but he planned to follow the pilot on the 
controls during the takeoff for familiarization purposes. During the takeoff roll when the 
airplane was approaching liftoff speed, the airplane made a rapid veeroff to the left. At that 
point, the pilot abandoned the takeoff, and made the conscious decision not to attempt to 
return to the runway, instead allowing the airplane to roll and decelerate on the grass/gravel 
beside the runway. That decision was based on the pilot's desire to avoid any potentially 
hazardous maneuvering or a ground loop. During the rollout, due to the pilot's inability to see 
directly ahead, the airplane struck the VASI (visual approach slope indicator) installation 
located about 1,300 feet down the runway, and offset about 145 feet from the runway 
centerline. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing struts. The pilot stated 
that he did not believe that any mechanical malfunction or failure contributed to or caused the 
runway excursion, and that he could not rule out the possibility that he had inadvertently 
applied one wheel brake during the takeoff roll.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the takeoff roll, which resulted in a 
runway excursion and a collision with an approach slope indicator system component.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Runway/taxi/approach light - Not specified

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
