Location:
Tampa, FL
Accident Number:
ERA13LA104
Date & Time:
01/02/2013, 1810 EST 
Registration:
N345VH
Aircraft:
ROBINSON HELICOPTER R22 BETA
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Hard landing
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The flight instructor and her student were practicing autorotations. The student entered a 
practice autorotation at 500 feet above ground level (agl) and at 70 knots. About 40 feet agl, 
the student bled off airspeed by flaring the helicopter. The student advanced the throttle, but 
the rpm started to decay. The instructor had her hands on the controls and added throttle to 
arrest the rpm decay. When the rpm continued to decay, she took the controls and performed a 
hovering autorotation. The helicopter impacted a grassy area next to the runway, bounced, and 
rolled over, coming to an immediate stop. The fuselage and main rotor sustained substantial 
damage. The flight instructor reported that there was excessive play in the left throttle and that 
she had reported the condition to the operator™s mechanic twice previously. Examination of the 
throttle system found it to be in an airworthy condition.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot™s delayed throttle application during the practice autorotation and the flight 
instructor™s lack of immediate remedial action, which resulted in a hard landing.
Findings
Aircraft
Descent rate - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Use of equip/system - Student pilot (Cause)
Delayed action - Instructor/check pilot (Cause)

Factual Information
On January 2, 2013, about 1810 eastern standard time, a Robinson R22 Beta, N345VH, was 
substantially damaged following a practice autorotation to runway 22 at Peter O Knight Airport 
(TPF), Tampa, Florida. The flight instructor and a student pilot were not injured. The 
helicopter was operated by Helicopter Academy under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 91 as an instructional flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and 
no flight plan was filed. The flight originated at Clearwater, Florida (PIE) about 1715.
The flight instructor reported that she landed at PIE to pick up her student and proceeded to 
TPF for approaches and practice autorotations. The first three approaches were uneventful. 
During the fourth approach to runway 22, the student entered a practice autorotation at 500 
feet above ground level (agl) and at 70 knots. About 40 feet agl, the student bled off airspeed by 
making ﬁbaby flares.ﬂ She reported that the student rolled on the throttle, but the governor did 
not catch and the rpm started to decay. The instructor had her hands on the controls and 
added throttle to arrest the rpm decay. When the rpm continued to decay, she took the controls 
and performed a hovering autorotation. The helicopter impacted a grassy area next to the 
runway, bounced, and rolled over, coming to an immediate stop. 
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector responded to the accident site and 
examined the wreckage. The inspector confirmed substantial damage to the airframe. Both 
main rotor blades were bent in several places. The engine firewall was buckled. The tail boom 
was crushed at the fuselage attachment point and the horizontal stabilizer was bent about 90 
degrees. The flight instructor reported to the inspector that there was excessive ﬁplayﬂ in the 
left throttle and she had reported the condition to the operator™s maintenance personnel twice 
previously, and was informed that the play was normal.
On January 8, 2013, the FAA re-inspected the helicopter throttle system with the assistance of 
a technical representative from Robinson Helicopter Company. The inspector reported that, 
based on the description of the throttle rigging provided to the technical representative, the 
throttle was in an airworthy condition.
Recorded weather at PTF at the time of the accident included calm surface wind.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
