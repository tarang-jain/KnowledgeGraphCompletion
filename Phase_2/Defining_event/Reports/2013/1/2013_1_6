Location:
Elkhart, IN
Accident Number:
CEN13LA127
Date & Time:
01/02/2013, 1125 EST 
Registration:
N707HL
Aircraft:
LUSCOMBE 8
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Abnormal runway contact
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot was landing the airplane when it touched down on the left main landing gear and 
bounced. The pilot attempted to recover from the bounce by reducing pitch so that the main 
landing gear wheels would touch down onto the runway surface, but he inadvertently applied 
too much pitch control input and also applied left rudder control input. The airplane then 
veered left off the runway and nosed-over when it impacted an area of plowed snow. The pilot 
reported no malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal 
operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s improper flare, which resulted in a bounced landing.
Findings
Aircraft
Pitch control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)

Factual Information
On January 2, 2013, about 1125 eastern standard time, a Luscombe 8F, N707HL, departed off 
the left side of the runway during landing at Mishawaka Pilots Club Airport (3C1), Elkhart, 
Indiana. The airplane received substantial damage. The commercial pilot and pilot-rated 
passenger were uninjured. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot under the 
provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed and a flight plan had not been filed for the local flight that originated from 
3C1 at 1050.
The pilot stated that on his third landing on runway 21 (2,243 feet by 40 feet, asphalt), the 
airplane landed with the left wing low and touched down onto the runway surface with only the 
left main landing gear. The airplane bounced "awkwardly" to the right because the pilot did not 
have the control stick forward enough to keep the main landing gear on the runway. The pilot 
over-corrected in lowering the airplane nose and attempting to get touch down on both main 
landing gear wheels. In this attempt, the pilot inputted too much forward right control stick 
and then left rudder. The airplane departed toward the left and off the runway surface.
The pilot stated that the runway had been plowed to about 10 feet beyond the edge of the 
runway. The airplane impacted the snow and nosed-over.
The pilot reported that there was no mechanic malfunction/failure of the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
