Analysis   
The pilot reported that after landing with an 8 mile-per-hour crosswind, his left foot became 
lodged under a rudder pedal. The airplane drifted off the runway pavement; he was unable to 
correct because of the soft turf condition. The nose landing gear subsequently dug into the 
ground and the airplane nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, 
left wing, and vertical stabilizer. The pilot reported that there were no failures or malfunctions 
with the airplane prior to the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing rollout, which resulted in a 
runway excursion and the airplane nosing over.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
