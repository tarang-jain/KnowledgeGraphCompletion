Location:
West Bend, WI
Accident Number:
CEN13CA042
Date & Time:
11/03/2012, 1250 CDT 
Registration:
N2368K
Aircraft:
LUSCOMBE 8E
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Nose over/nose down
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot departed a 1,500-foot-long grass runway in calm wind conditions and was unable to 
gain enough altitude to clear power lines at the end of the runway. He aborted the takeoff and 
landed in a plowed field near the departure end of the runway. The airplane nosed over on 
landing damaging the vertical stabilizer, the right wing tip, both main landing gear, and the 
propeller. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane or engine that would have precluded normal operation. He said the accident could 
have been prevented if he had waited for better wind conditions or extended the takeoff roll to 
gain additional airspeed.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot‚s failure to maintain clearance from power lines at the end of the short runway, which 
resulted in an aborted takeoff and subsequent nose-over of the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
