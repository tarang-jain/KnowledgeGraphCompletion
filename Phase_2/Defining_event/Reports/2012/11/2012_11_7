Analysis   
The commercial pilot said he applied full power to go around after a bounced landing. Torque 
generated by the turboprop engine pulled the airplane to the right, and the pilot stated that he 
was unable to arrest the turn. The airplane collided with trees, resulting in substantial damage 
to the right wing, fuselage, vertical stabilizer, both horizontal stabilizers, and the rudder. The 
pilot reported there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane or engine 
that would have precluded normal operation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
