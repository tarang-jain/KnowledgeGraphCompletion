Analysis   
The pilot reported that after a normal approach, he landed the tailwheel-equipped airplane on 
the main wheels (wheel landing). As the airplane decelerated during the landing roll, the pilot 
directed his attention inside of the cockpit and eased back pressure off of the control yoke. 
When the pilot redirected his attention outside, the airplane nosed down, and the propeller 
struck the ground; the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted. During the accident 
sequence, the wings and empennage were substantially damaged. The pilot reported that there 
were no mechanical failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
