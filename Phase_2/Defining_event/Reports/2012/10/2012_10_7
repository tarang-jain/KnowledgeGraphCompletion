Factual Information
On October 4, 2012, about 2010 central daylight time, a Boeing 717-200, N894AT, was struck 
by a catering truck while it was parked at the gate at General Mitchell International Airport 
(KMKE), Milwaukee, Wisconsin. There were no injuries to the deplaning 103 passengers and 5 
flight crew. The airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane was registered to Wells 
Fargo Bank Northwest, NA, Salt Lake City, Utah, and operated by Southwest Airlines, Inc., 
Dallas, Texas, as Flight 725, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as 
a scheduled domestic passenger flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time 
of the accident, and an instrument flight rules flight plan had been filed and closed. The cross-
country flight had originated from Hartsfield - Jackson Atlanta International Airport (KATL), 
Atlanta, Georgia.
The airplane had arrived at gate C14 and passengers had started deplaning. A catering truck, 
owned by AirTran Airways and operated by Aerotek Aviation, approached the right front 
service door. The driver said he attempted to stop, applying the brakes 3 times. The truck did 
not stop and struck the airplane. After the accident, the driver of the truck found a sleeve of 
hot/cold cups under the brake pedal. The damage to the airplane was confined to the area of 
the production splice, a joint where the forward portion of the fuselage is mated to the 
midsection fuselage. This included fuselage stations 207, 218, 228. 235, and 250.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
