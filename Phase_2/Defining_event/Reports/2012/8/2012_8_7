Analysis   
The student pilot had performed two takeoffs and landings in the tailwheel-equipped airplane 
and then elected to perform a full-stop, three-point landing. The student pilot stated that he 
applied left aileron and right rudder control inputs to correct for a left crosswind during the 
landing approach; however, after the three-point landing, the airplane veered to the left. He 
attempted to regain directional control, but the airplane continued off the left side of the 
runway, where it collided with trees and bushes, resulting in substantial damage to the right 
wing. The student pilot reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that 
would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot™s failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
