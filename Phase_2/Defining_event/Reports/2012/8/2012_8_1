CEN12CA510
Date & Time:
08/01/2012, 0015 CDT 
Registration:
N462TR
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172S
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The airplane was on final approach to land after the completion of a local night instructional 
flight. The flight instructor was to demonstrate the proper pitch attitude and sight picture 
needed for a landing at night. On short final, just before touchdown, the airplane drifted off of 
the runway centerline to the left. Upon touchdown the airplane was still moving toward the left 
side of the runway. The instructor stated that with the low energy state of the airplane there 
was not enough room to perform a go-around safely. The airplane then exited the runway as he 
applied flight control inputs to correct back to the centerline. Upon exiting the runway, the 
airplane impacted a runway light on the lower portion of the right wing strut attach point, 
resulting in structural damage to the strut. The instructor reported that the accident could have 
been prevented if positive control was maintained during the landing phase of the flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor™s loss of directional control during landing, which resulted in a collision 
with a runway light.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Runway/taxi/approach light - Contributed to outcome

Note:

to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=84557
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
