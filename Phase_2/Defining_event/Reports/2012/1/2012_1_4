Location:
Del Norte, CO
Accident Number:
CEN12CA132
Date & Time:
01/02/2012, 1350 MDT 
Registration:
N9952Q
Aircraft:
PIPER PA-18-135
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Runway excursion
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The pilot, who held a private pilot certificate, was receiving dual instruction from a certified 
flight instructor (CFI) to become familiar with his newly acquired tailwheel-equipped airplane. 
After practicing some standard flight maneuvers at altitude, the pilot returned to the departure 
airport to practice full stop landings and takeoffs. The CFI demonstrated the first landing, and 
then the pilot performed the next four landings and takeoffs with the CFI monitoring the 
controls and providing assistance when necessary. The CFI stated that the pilot's first landing 
was normal, the second landing required minor directional control assistance, the third 
landing required no assistance, and the fourth landing required some assistance from the base 
leg to final approach but the landing and roll were normal. On the fifth landing, the pilot made 
a nice three-point touchdown and rolled straight ahead. During the landing roll, the airplane 
suddenly swerved to the right and the CFI noticed that the pilot had already applied full left 
corrective rudder. The CFI then applied the left brake, but the application was ineffective. He 
then applied right brake to slow the airplane's pending departure off the runway. The airplane 
nosed over and came to rest in a snow bank that was bordering the runway. The top of the 
rudder sustained substantial damage.
The airplane was equipped with a supplemental type certificate non-standard brake system. 
The CFI stated that, when he had ferried the airplane, he noted that the brake system was 
extremely sensitive. The CFI stated that he told the pilot early in his instruction that the use of 
the brakes should be avoided in normal operations due to their sensitivity. The CFI stated that 
he believes that the sensitivity of the brake system was a causal factor in the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of directional control during the landing roll, which resulted in a runway 
excursion. Contributing to the accident were the sensitivity of the brake system and the 
certified flight instructor pilot's delayed remedial action.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=82672
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
