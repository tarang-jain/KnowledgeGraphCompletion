Analysis   
On February 2, 2012, about 1442 Alaska standard time, Volga-Dnepr Airlines flight VDA 4410, 
an Antonov AN-124-100, registration RA82046, encountered turbulence during approach to 
land to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC), Anchorage, Alaska. The airplane 
was not damaged but two crew members received serious injuries. The flight was operating 
under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 129 as an unscheduled cargo flight from Campbell Army 
Airfield, Fort Campbell, Kentucky to ANC.
According to flight crew statements there were pilot reports of light turbulence in the area. 
While the airplane was about 40 miles from ANC at an altitude of about 13,000 feet and clear 
of clouds, the flight encountered severe turbulence that lasted for about 3 to 10 seconds. The 
flight crew reported that the airplane's g-meter recorded the event at -0.6 to +2.0 Gs.
At the time of the turbulence, one maintenance crew member was in the aft technical cabin 
returning from the lavatory and a second maintenance crewmember was in his seat with the 
seatbelt buckled but was jolted against the arm rest. Both crewmembers received serious 
injuries.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=82811
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
