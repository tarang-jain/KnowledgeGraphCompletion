Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
According to the pilot of the powered parachute, he took off in a westerly direction with a right 
crosswind, and during the initial climb, the parachute veered left. The pilot tried to correct the 
direction of flight, but the cart struck a tree and then impacted the ground, seriously injuring 
the pilot and substantially damaging the metal tube airframe. According to a witness, the 
powered parachute was flying ﬁnormalﬂ until a gust of wind pushed it into the tree. 
Postaccident examination revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
powered parachute that would have precluded normal operation. The wind reported at an 
airport 4 miles to the southeast of the accident location was from 360 degrees at 5 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s inadequate compensation for the wind during the initial climb, which resulted in 
collision with a tree and terrain.
Findings

Crosswind correction - Not attained/maintained (Cause)

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=84951
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
