Analysis   
The pilot reported that he landed the tailwheel-equipped airplane on the main wheels and 
upon slowing to about 20 mph, lowered the tailwheel to the runway. The airplane veered to the 
right, and the pilot attempted to control the direction by applying the left brake. He 
ﬁovercorrectedﬂ to the left, and the airplane ground looped and veered off the left side of the 
runway. The inspection of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the right wing spar. The 
pilot stated that he should have added power to maintain directional control as soon as the 
turn started. He reported no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
