Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Bedminster, NJ
Accident Number:
ERA12CA204
Date & Time:
03/02/2012, 1800 EST 
Registration:
N518F
Aircraft:
AMERICAN CHAMPION AIRCRAFT 
7GCAA
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Collision during takeoff/land
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The flight instructor stated that he and the pilot receiving instruction were practicing traffic 
pattern work and had performed two simulated engine failures without incident before the 
accident. The flight instructor initiated a third simulated engine failure at a higher altitude 
than the previous two and suggested the pilot receiving instruction perform S-turns to lose 
altitude. During the maneuver, the airplane descended too low to complete a power-off landing 
to the runway, and the flight instructor told the pilot receiving instruction to perform a go-
around. The flight instructor also reached for the throttle to add full power for the go-around, 
but the airplane abruptly pitched down and impacted the ground, substantially damaging the 
wings and fuselage. Postaccident examination revealed that the pitch trim control was in the 
full forward (nose-down) position.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot receiving instruction™s inadvertent movement of the pitch trim control to the nose-
down position while attempting a go-around.
Findings
Aircraft
Pitch control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=83025
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
