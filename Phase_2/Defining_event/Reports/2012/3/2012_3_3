Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The pilot reported that he was conducting annual refresher training with a certified flight 
instructor. During a practice autorotation to runway 18, the helicopter descended below a 
nearby tree line and then suddenly dropped. He stated that the helicopter descended so rapidly 
that he was unable to arrest the descent rate and the helicopter landed hard. The pilot reported 
that the wind was from 230 degrees at 10 knots with gusts to 19 knots at the time of the 
accident. He reported that, as the helicopter descended below treetop level, "–we lost all lift 
and wind advantage." The hard landing resulted in a fractured tail boom. The pilots reported 
no mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the gusting wind, which resulted in an excessive 
descent rate and hard landing.
Findings
Aircraft
Descent rate - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Gusts - Response/compensation (Cause)

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=83005
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
