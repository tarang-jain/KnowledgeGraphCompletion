Analysis 
THE WEAK LINK AT THE TOW VEHICLE BROKE DURING LAUNCHING. THE PLT 
LOWERED THE NOSE OF THE ACFT AND TURNED INTO THE WIND. THE PLT STATED 
THAT THE ACFT WAS STALLED AND THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO STOP THE DESCENT 
RATE. THE ACFT STRUCK THE RUNWAY IN A SLIGHT NOSE DOWN ATTITUDE. THE 
WEAK LINK ROPE WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR TESTING TO DETERMINE THE 
STRENGTH OF THE ROPE AND ANY DEFECTS. THE PLT ASSUMED TOO HIGH OF A 
PITCH ANGLE TOO LOW TO THE GROUND DURING INITIAL CLIMB FOR THIS TYPE OF 
LAUNCH WITH THE TOW HOOK BEING FORWARD OF THE ACFT'S C.G. BEING 
APPROXIMATELY 150 FT AGL WHEN THE STALL OCCURRED, THE PLT WAS UNABLE 
TO FULLY RECOVER PRIOR TO CONTACTING THE RUNWAY.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
