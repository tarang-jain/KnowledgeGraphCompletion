Substantial

Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
According to the private pilot, as he applied braking action during rollout, the airplane began 
to veer left. Although he added right rudder to correct the problem, he was not able to stop the 
airplane from veering to the left. The right main landing gear collapsed and the airplane spun 
around approximately 180 degrees, coming to rest on the runway surface. Examination of the 
airplane revealed a significant amount of side load had occurred, and both the left and right 
main landing gears collapsed to the left.  The right wing was damaged when the landing gear 
collapsed. There were several tire marks on the runway that terminated at the point where the 
airplane rested. The pilot did not report a mechanical problem with the airplane prior to and 
during the accident sequence of events.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Pilot in command failed to maintain directional control of the airplane during the landing roll 
that resulted in a ground loop and the overload failure of the right main landing gear.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
