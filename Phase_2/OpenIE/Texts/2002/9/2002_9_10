Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The commercial certificated pilot was departing a remote grass-covered airstrip in a tundra 
tire-equipped airplane.  The airstrip is oriented northeast/southwest, and is about 800 feet 
long by about 30 feet wide.  The pilot said that he taxied to the end of the airstrip to depart 
toward the southwest.  He applied full power and the airplane began to veer to the left.  He said 
he attempted to correct the left turn by application of the right brake, but the airplane slid on 
the wet grass surface of the runway.  The left wing struck the top of a small tree along the left 
side of the airstrip.  The pilot indicated the airplane continued in a left arc, off the left side of 
the runway, and collided with a large tree.  The airplane received damage to the left wing, 
fuselage, engine motor mounts, and propeller.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of directional control of the airplane due to the failure of the pilot to correct for torque/P 
Factor during the takeoff roll.  A factor in the accident was a wet grass surface.

Factual Information
On September 2, 2002, about 1600 Alaska daylight time, a tundra tire-equipped Cessna 185 
airplane, N9808X, sustained substantial damage when it collided with trees during the takeoff 
roll from a remote airstrip, about 58 miles east of Seward, Alaska.  The airplane was being 
operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country personal flight under Title 14, CFR Part 
91, when the accident occurred.  The airplane was operated by the pilot, with an intended 
destination of Merrill Field, Anchorage, Alaska.  The commercial certificated pilot, the sole 
occupant, was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  No flight plan was filed, 
nor was one required.
On October 1, 2002, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) personnel notified the National 
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) that the accident airplane 
received damage during takeoff from a grass-covered airstrip on Montague Island.
During a telephone conversation with the NTSB IIC on October 2, the pilot reported that he 
was departing an old Forest Service airstrip located at Patton Bay on Montague Island for a 
flight to Merrill Field.  The airstrip is oriented northeast/southwest, and is about 800 feet long 
by about 30 feet wide.  The pilot said that he taxied to the end of the airstrip to depart toward 
the southwest.  He applied full power and the airplane began to veer to the left.  He said he 
attempted to correct the left turn by application of the right brake, but the airplane slid on the 
wet grass surface of the runway.  The left wing struck the top of a small tree along the left side 
of the airstrip.  The pilot indicated the airplane continued in a left arc, off the left side of the 
runway, and collided with a large tree.  The airplane received damage to the left wing, fuselage, 
engine motor mounts, and propeller.
The pilot reported the wind at the time of the accident was from the north at 10 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
