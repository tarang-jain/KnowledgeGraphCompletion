the right and collide with trees on the south side of the approach end of the landing runway.

Factual Information
On September 1, 2002, about 0945 eastern daylight time, a Clarence F. Callahan Challenger II, 
N521CF, registered to and operated by a private individual, as a Title 14 CFR Part 91 personal 
flight, impacted trees and crashed while attempting to land at Orlando Country Airport, 
Plymouth, Florida. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. The 
private-rated pilot received minor injuries, and the airplane incurred substantial damage. The 
flight originated the same day, about 0935.
The pilot stated that he was on final approach to land, and it appeared as if he was going to 
undershoot the runway, so he attempted to correct the situation by applying throttle control 
input to increase engine power, but he applied a little too much power, which caused the 
airplane to dive to the right and collide with trees on the south end of the runway. The airplane 
incurred damage to the landing gear, the wings, and the fuselage. The pilot said that this 
accident was purely his error, and that there had been no mechanical failures or malfunctions 
with the airplane or any of its systems prior to the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
