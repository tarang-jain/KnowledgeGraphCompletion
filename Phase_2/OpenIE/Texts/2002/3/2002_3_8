Factual Information
On March 3, 2002, at 1130 mountain standard time, an experimental Fairchild 24W-46, 
N77618, nosed over during the turnoff from landing at the Marana Northwest Regional Airport 
(AVQ), Marana, Arizona.  The airplane, owned and operated by the private pilot under the 
provisions of 14 CFR Part 91, sustained substantial damage.  The pilot, the sole occupant, was 
not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  The cross-country flight departed the 
Casa Grande Municipal Airport, Casa Grande, Arizona, about 1100, and was destined for AVQ.  
No flight plan had been filed.
In the pilot's written statement, he indicated that he made a normal wheel landing.  On rollout 
he applied rudder and then brake to maintain directional control.  He stated that the left brake 
locked up and the airplane went over on it's back.
During retrieval of the airplane, the brake pads were loosened.  Both the owner and the person 
assisting with the retrieval noted that there was no clearance of the brake pads.  When they 
attempted to push in the piston to release the disk they found it could not be moved.  They also 
noticed that the brake pads were discolored.  No further discrepancies were noted with the 
brake system.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
