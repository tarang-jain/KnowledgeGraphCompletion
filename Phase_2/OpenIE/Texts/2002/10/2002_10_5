Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Edgartown, MA
Accident Number:
NYC03LA003
Date & Time:
10/01/2002, 1050 EDT 
Registration:
N8071Z
Aircraft:
Piper PA-28-181
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
Arriving in the airport area, the pilot determined that the wind was favoring runway 06.  While 
on approach to runway 06, severe turbulence and a wind shift was encountered.  After crossing 
the threshold of the runway, the airplane appeared to be landing with a tailwind, and the pilot 
initiated a go-around.  During the go-around, as the pilot pulled back on the control yoke, the 
airplane continued to descend towards the ground.  The airplane struck a tree, touched down 
in a grass field located beyond the departure end of the runway, and came to rest upright.  The 
recorded weather at a nearby airport, about the time of the accident, included winds from 250 
degrees at 16 knots, gusting to 21 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate in-flight evaluation of the landing facilities wind conditions, and 
inadequate airspeed resulting in a stall/mush.  A factor related to the accident was the tailwind 
condition.

Factual Information
On October 1, 2002, about 1050 eastern daylight time, a Piper PA-28-181, N8071Z, was 
substantially damaged during a go-around from the Katama Airport, Edgartown, 
Massachusetts.  The certificated commercial pilot and passenger were not injured.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight 
conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
According to the pilot, upon arriving in the airport area, he determined that the wind was 
favoring runway 06; a 2,700-foot long, 50-foot wide, turf runway.  While on approach to 
runway 06, severe turbulence and a wind shift was encountered.  After crossing the threshold 
of the runway, the airplane appeared to be landing with a tailwind, and the pilot initiated a go-
around.  During the go-around, as the pilot pulled back on the control yoke, the airplane 
continued to descend toward the ground.  The airplane struck a tree, touched down in a grass 
field located beyond the departure end of the runway, and came to rest upright.
The pilot additionally reported he did not experience any difficulties with the engine or 
airframe during the flight.
Examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed 
substantial damage to the lower empennage section of the airplane.  The examination did not 
reveal any mechanical anomalies with the engine or airframe. 
The recorded weather at a nearby airport, at 1053, included winds from 250 degrees at 16 
knots, gusting to 21 knots.  The recorded winds at 0953 were from 260 degrees at 12 knots, 
gusting to 19 knots.

NTSB accident and incident dockets serve as permanent archival information for the NTSB™s 
investigations. Dockets released prior to June 1, 2009 are publicly available from the NTSB™s

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
