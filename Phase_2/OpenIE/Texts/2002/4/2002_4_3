Factual Information
On April 1, 2002, about 2005 eastern standard time, a Boeing 747-400, G-BNLS, operated by 
British Airways as flight 214, was not damaged when it encountered turbulence shortly after 
takeoff from Boston/General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport (BOS), Boston 
Massachusetts.  The 2 certificated airline transport pilots, 15 flight attendants, and 196 
passengers were not injured.  One passenger sustained serious injuries.  Visual meteorological 
conditions (VMC) prevailed and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the 
flight destined for London-Heathrow Airport (LHR), London, England.  The scheduled 
international passenger flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 129.
In a written statement, the flight crew reported that 20 minutes after departure they 
encountered "moderate turbulence" while climbing through flight level (FL) 350, to their 
assigned altitude of FL 370.  Several minutes later, they requested a descent from air traffic 
control to FL 330 to maneuver around the turbulence.  During the descent, a flight attendant 
informed the flight crew that a passenger fell during the turbulence encounter and broke her 
right ankle.  The flight crew then initiated a return to Boston, and landed without further 
incident.  After landing, the passenger was transported to the hospital and the airplane was 
inspected for damage.  When no damage was observed, the flight departed again at 2214, and 
continued to London uneventfully.
The flight crew reported that windshear advisories had been issued at Boston prior to their 
departure; however, no turbulence was forecasted for their route of flight.  The seat belt sign 
was illuminated for the entire fight.  
According to flight attendant interviews conducted by British Airways, the flight conditions 
were described as "fairly smooth" and the seat belt sign was illuminated as they prepared for 
the in-flight service.  About 20-30 minutes into the flight, the airplane "shook briefly" and 
experienced a "sudden jolt."  During the encounter, a passenger from seat 17J was returning to 
her seat from the lavatory, when she fell and was injured.  A flight attendant administered first 
aid to the passenger and notified the flight crew of the injury.  The flight crew then informed 
the flight attendants and passengers that the flight would be returning to Boston.  
The weather reported at Boston, at 1954, included wind from 270 degrees at 18 knots, gusting 
to 31 knots, 10 miles visibility, clear skies, temperature 8 degrees Celsius, dewpoint -3 degrees 
Celsius, and altimeter setting 29.80 in Hg.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
