Factual Information
On May 1, 2002, about 1430 eastern daylight time, a Bell 47J-2A helicopter, N37731, was 
substantially damaged while landing at the Blairstown Airport, Blairstown, New Jersey.  The 
certificated commercial pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and 
no flight plan was filed for the sightseeing flight conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
According to the pilot, just after the helicopter lifted off the ground, the passenger advised that 
a camera had fallen under a seat, and he could not reach it.  The pilot elected to hover to a 
helipad located in grass area, just east of the runway.  Four tires marked off the helipad, one at 
each corner.  As the helicopter neared the ground, the pilot flared, and the tail rotor blades 
struck one of the tires.  The helicopter rotated to the right and began to climb.  The pilot closed 
the throttle, and the helicopter touched down hard on the helipad, coming to rest upright.
Examination of the helicopter by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the 
gearbox had separated from the tail boom, and the main landing skids were collapsed around 
both sides of the fuselage.
The recorded weather at a nearby airport, about the time of the accident, included winds from 
290 degrees at 8 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
