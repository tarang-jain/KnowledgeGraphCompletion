During, the landing on runway 28, the airplane veered off the runway when it encountered 
gusty crosswinds.  The nearest weather observation facility ( located approximately 22 nautical 
miles east of the accident site) reported the wind from 220 degrees at 9 knots with gusts to 16 
knots.  Further, the wind was reported as variable from 180 degrees to 260 degrees.  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's inadequate compensation for the gusty crosswind conditions resulting in a loss of 
control of the airplane during the landing.  A contributing factor was the gusty crosswind.

Factual Information
On May 2, 2002, approximately 1230 mountain daylight time, a Piper PA-28-180 single-engine 
airplane, N7504W, sustained substantial damage following a loss of control during landing on 
runway 28 at the Dona Ana County Airport near Santa Teresa, New Mexico.  The airplane was 
owned by PIR, Inc., of Salem, Oregon, and operated by a private individual under 14 Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 91.  The private pilot and his passenger received minor injuries.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the cross-country flight, and a flight plan was 
not filed.  The flight departed San Angelo, Texas, at an unknown time, with a planned 
destination of Deming, New Mexico.
The pilot reported that during the cross-country flight the airplane encountered "strong 
headwinds and got low on fuel."  The pilot requested and received flight following to the 
nearest airport for refueling.  During the landing, the aircraft veered off the runway when it 
encountered gusty winds. Subsequently, the nose gear collapsed, and the aircraft came to rest 
upright. 
A mechanic, who examined the airplane, reported structural damage to the engine firewall.  
At 1251, the El Paso weather observation facility (located approximately 22 nautical miles east 
of the accident site) reported the wind from 220 degrees at 9 knots with gusts to 16 knots.  
Further, the wind was variable from 180 degrees to 260 degrees.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
