Analysis 
THE BOEING A75N1 (STEARMAN) PILOT REPORTED THAT A LONG FINAL APPROACH 
WAS FLOWN TO ALLOW ROOM FOR A TWIN ENGINE AIRCRAFT TO LAND IN FRONT OF 
HIM. HE CONTINUED LANDING, BUT DID NOT SEE A BEIGE COLORED CESSNA 172 ON 
THE RUNWAY. HE REPORTED THAT THE VISIBILITY WAS VERY POOR FROM THE 
BACK SEAT OF THE STEARMAN. AS HE WAS ABOUT TO TOUCHDOWN, THE LANDING 
GEAR STRUCK THE LEFT WING OF THE CESSNA 172. THE PILOT HEARD THE SOUND 
OF METAL, BUT WAS UNAWARE THAT HIS PLANE HAD HIT ANOTHER AIRCRAFT 
UNTIL HE TAXIED TO THE HANGAR. THE CESSNA PILOT STATED THAT HE HAD 
WAITED FOR THE TWIN ENGINE TO LAND, ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION ON THE 
RADIO, BUT SAW NO AIRCRAFT ON FINAL. HE TAXIED ONTO THE RUNWAY TO HOLD, 
AND THEN AS HE ADVANCED POWER TO TAKEOFF, THE COLLISION OCCURRED. THE 
STEARMAN WAS NOT EQUIPPED WITH A RADIO.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
