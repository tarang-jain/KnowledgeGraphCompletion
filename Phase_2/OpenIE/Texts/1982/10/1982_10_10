Analysis 
DURING A LOCAL FLIGHT, THE PILOT MADE 3 LANDINGS ON A 2860 FT RUNWAY AT 
SPORTSMAN AIRPARK. HE THEN LANDED ON A 2300 FT TURF RUNWAY AT 
CHEHALEM AIRPORT IN LIGHT AND VARIABLE WIND CONDITIONS. WHILE LANDING 
AT CHEHALEM, THE AIRCRAFT ROLLED BEYOND THE DEPARTURE END OF THE 
RUNWAY, CROSSED A DITCH AND ROAD AND CAME TO REST IN A SECOND DITCH. 
THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE BRAKE EFFECTIVENESS WAS QUESTIONABLE. 
HOWEVER, AN EXAMINATION OF THE RUNWAY REVEALED SCUF MARKS FROM THE 
PLANE'S MAIN WHEELS, BEGINNING ABOUT 150 FT FROM THE DEPARTURE END. THE 
OWNER OF A BRAKE REPAIR FACILITY STATED THAT THE MARKS INDICATED TO HIM 
THAT BOTH BRAKES WERE ACTIVATED AND LOCKED. THE RIGHT MAIN GEAR FAILED 
WHEN THE PLANE CROSSED THE FIRST DITCH. AT THAT LOCATION, A SPRAY 
PATTERN OF HYDRAULIC FLUID WAS FOUND WHICH WAS TYPICAL OF FLUID UNDER 
PRESSURE. AN EXAMINATION OF THE BRAKES REVEALED ONLY NORMAL WEAR.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
