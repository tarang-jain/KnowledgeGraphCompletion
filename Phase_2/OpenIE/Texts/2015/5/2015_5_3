Location:
PEARLAND, TX
Accident Number:
GAA15CA059
Date & Time:
05/01/2015, 0940 CDT 
Registration:
N66048
Aircraft:
CESSNA 180K
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot stated that during the takeoff roll, the tail of the airplane began to lift, and an 
increasing amount of right rudder was required to maintain directional control and he believed 
that the airplane was at the beginning stages of a ground loop. The pilot reported that he 
applied full right rudder with a "stab" of right brake, the airplane stopped going to the left, and 
the right main wheel "snagged" the edge of a ditch and spun the airplane to the right, which 
resulted in substantial damage to the right aileron and wing. 
The pilot reported no pre-impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or 
engine that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the takeoff roll, which resulted in a 
runway excursion.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Sloped/uneven terrain - Contributed to outcome

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
