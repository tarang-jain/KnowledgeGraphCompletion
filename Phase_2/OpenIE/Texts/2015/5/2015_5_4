Analysis   
While maneuvering in mountainous terrain about 700 feet above ground level, the airplane 
encountered "an extreme clear-air [sic] microburst." The pilot was unable to control the 
descent rate and executed an off-airport landing. During the landing, the nose gear collapsed 
and the airplane nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the vertical 
stabilizer and both wings. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of 
mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The inadvertent encounter with a microburst while maneuvering near mountainous terrain, 
which resulted in a off airport landing and impact with terrain.
Findings

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=91126
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
