Location:
Brookneal, VA
Accident Number:
ERA15CA120
Date & Time:
02/04/2015, 1646 EST 
Registration:
N619GB
Aircraft:
PIPER PA 18-150
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
According to the flight instructor and the pilot-rated student, both believed the airplane had 
been fueled at the time it was pulled out of the hanger by line personnel, and they had observed 
a fuel truck parked near the airplane prior to the flight. The student had performed the 
preflight inspection, during which he interpreted the fuel sight gauges as indicating full fuel; 
however, he did not visually check the fuel in the tanks. When the instructor arrived at the 
airplane, he asked the student how much fuel was on board and the student said the tanks were 
full. The flight departed from Lynchburg, Virginia and made several takeoffs and landings at a 
nearby airport. About 1 hour into the flight as the airplane was 1,000 feet above ground level, 
the engine lost all power. As the instructor began a turn toward a nearby pasture, the engine 
started producing power again and the instructor chose to continue the turn, heading toward 
the nearest airport. The engine then lost all power again. No longer able to glide to the nearby 
pasture, the instructor flew the airplane straight ahead and let it settle into the trees. The 
airplane struck the trees and terrain and came to rest inverted. Examination of the wreckage by 
a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed substantial damage to the wings and 
fuselage. The inspector recovered about 1 pint of fuel from each fuel tank. Additionally, neither 
pilot reported any mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation of the airframe or engine.
After the accident, the flight school held safety briefings with its instructors, faculty, and 
students. These briefings included discussion of the circumstances of the accident, and the 
implementation of policy changes related to pre and post flight responsibilities of students and 
instructors, new fuel level measuring procedures, and dispatch records of fuel status. These 
changes were applied to all airplane types and operations at the school, and were subsequently 
written in the Flight Operations Manual.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor and pilot-rated student's inadequate preflight inspection, which resulted 
in a total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=90691
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
