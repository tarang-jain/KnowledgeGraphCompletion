Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
West Point, VA
Accident Number:
GAA16CA066
Date & Time:
12/01/2015, 2135 EST 
Registration:
N28295
Aircraft:
GRUMMAN AMERICAN AVN. CORP. 
AA 5
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that during a flight under night instrument flight rules, he exited instrument 
metrological conditions (IMC) "400 feet high and fast" during the instrument approach. The 
pilot continued the landing and reported that he touched down more than half way down the 
wet runway, and then decided to abort the landing. Instead of performing the published missed 
approach procedure, the pilot turned left and entered the traffic pattern. 
During the left base, the pilot reported that he reentered IMC, heard the stall warning horn, 
and felt buffeting. During the inadvertent aerodynamic stall, the pilot added power but 
continued the descent to land. The pilot reported that he regained visual reference to the 
runway lights on final approach and realized he was too low. As he attempted to add full power 
to go-around, the airplane impacted terrain about 1,300 feet west of the runway in a left wing 
down attitude. The vertical stabilizer, fuselage, and both wings sustained substantial damage. 
The pilot reported there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to fly a traffic pattern following an aborted instrument landing in night 
instrument metrological conditions, which resulted in a loss of visual reference to the runway, 
an inadvertent aerodynamic stall, and a collision with terrain.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
