Analysis   
After landing, the pilot taxied to the fixed base operator to park. As he approached the parking 
ramp, a lineman stood in front of a tie-down spot and raised both hands in the air signaling to 
the pilot where to park. The spot was next to a parked jet. The pilot said that while taxing to the 
parking spot he was concentrating on staying clear of the jet and did not see a light pole located 
at the edge of the ramp. The right wing struck the pole resulting in structural damage to the 
wing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
