Accident Number:
ERA15CA089
Date & Time:
01/02/2015, 1640 AST 
Registration:
N3183T
Aircraft:
ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY 
R44 II
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Tailstrike
Injuries:
1 Minor, 2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
After renting the helicopter from a flight school, the pilot took off and flew to a nearby town 
where he picked up two passengers. He then flew them to another town to attend a party. 
During the flights everything was normal. Upon arrival at their destination, the pilot began to 
circle and asked one of the passengers to call a friend who was on the ground on his cell phone, 
to check the landing area to make sure it was clear for him to land. After the pilot was told it 
was "clear for landing," he started a smooth descent "with all of the instruments in the green 
arc," to the landing area which was located on a dirt road on the ridge of a mountain. The 
landing was smooth and the pilot touched down lightly on the skids. While the helicopter had 
not fully set down and was still light on the skids, he began to check the "balance of the 
helicopter" before setting the collective to the full down position. When he moved the cyclic 
forward, the helicopter pitched forward. Then when he moved the cyclic aft to its previous 
position, the helicopter pitched aft and he heard a "big noise" and felt a vibration. He 
immediately "pulled" collective and rolled the throttle to the full throttle position to get the 
helicopter back into the air but, the helicopter started to spin clockwise and he could not stop 
the rotation, even with the application of full left pedal. He then leveled the helicopter while it 
was still spinning and tried to make it back to the landing site but, there was not enough power 
to keep it airborne. The left skid then contacted the ground and the helicopter rolled over on to 
its left side. Postaccident examination of the helicopter by a Federal Aviation Administration 
inspector revealed that the tail rotor assembly and tail boom were substantially damaged.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain control of the helicopter while landing which resulted in a 
tailrotor ground strike and collision with terrain.

Page 5 of 5ERA15CA089
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
