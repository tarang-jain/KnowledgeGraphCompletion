N9490X
Aircraft:
CESSNA 182R

Substantial

Hard landing

Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that he landed the airplane with full flaps, which he usually did not do, and 
believed that the full flaps created an excessive approach descent rate. Upon touchdown, the 
airplane bounced several times, and was hard to taxi after exiting the runway. A post landing 
examination by the pilot revealed structural damage to the firewall and fuselage.
The pilot reported that prior to the landing, there were no mechanical anomalies with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's excessive descent rate during approach, which resulted in a hard landing.
Findings
Aircraft
Descent rate - Not attained/maintained
Personnel issues

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
