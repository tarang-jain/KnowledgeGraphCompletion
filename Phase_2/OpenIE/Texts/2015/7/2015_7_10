Analysis   
**This report was modified on 4/21/2016. Please see the public docket for this accident for 
more information.**
The pilots of the two balloons involved in a midair collision reported that they both began the 
takeoff ascent as part of a competition. The Balloon Works balloon pilot, who was lower than 
the Balony balloon during the ascent, reported that his envelope collided vertically with the 
basket of the Balony balloon, about 2,000 feet above the ground. The Balony balloon pilot 
reported that he saw the Balloon Works balloon below him and started to use both of the 
available burners, but was unable to climb fast enough. A witness to the accident reported that 
the Balony balloon pilot did not use the balloon's burners until after the collision. After the 
midair collision, the Balloon Works balloon began to descend about 700 feet per minute and 
impacted the ground. The pilot of the Balony Balloon reported that he landed without further 
incident.
Both of the pilots reported there were no pre-impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with 
their balloons or burners that would have precluded normal operation. 
A postaccident inspection of the Balony balloon revealed no damage to the balloon or the 
burner. A postaccident inspection of the Balloon Works balloon revealed substantial damage to 
the envelope.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=91500
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
