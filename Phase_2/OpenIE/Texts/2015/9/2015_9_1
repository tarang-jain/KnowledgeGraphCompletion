Analysis   
The pilot of the tailwheel equipped, tandem cockpit airplane, who was sitting in the rear seat, 
reported that during the takeoff roll, the airplane veered off the left side of the runway and 
ground looped. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or 
engine that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported that he did not have any experience piloting a tailwheel equipped airplane 
from the rear seat and he could not see the instruments with the passenger seated in the front 
seat.
Probable Cause and Findings

The pilot's loss of directional control during the takeoff roll, which resulted in a runway 
excursion, ground loop, and impact with terrain. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's 
lack of experience from the back seat.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=91901
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
