Location:
Milltown, WI
Accident Number:
CHI01FA044
Date & Time:
12/03/2000, 1515 CST 
Registration:
N7678N
Aircraft:
Beech 95-B55
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
While maneuvering on a local instructional flight the multi-engine airplane entered a spin that 
resulted in an in-flight collision with the terrain.  Witnesses to the accident described the 
airplane in a spin.   The certified flight instructor (CFI) occupied the right seat during the 
accident flight.  The right seat was secured in the full aft position.   There was a handwritten 
placard that stated, "right seat fixed in the aft position."  Four pillows were recovered at the 
accident site.  An officer with the local law enforcement reported that one of the pillows was 
found beneath the CFI and that there were two pillows behind her back.  The forth pillow was 
found lying between the CFI and the dual student.  No additional anomalies were found with 
respect to the airplane that could be associated with a pre-impact condition.  The Pilot 
Operating Handbook (POH) for the Beech 95-B55 aircraft states that recovery from a spin will 
become more difficult if the pilot delays taking corrective action.  The POH states, "Always 
remember that extra alertness and pilot techniques are required for slow flight maneuvers, 
including the practice or demonstration of stalls or [flight at minimum controllable airspeed]."  
The POH further states that, "Whenever a student pilot will be required to practice slow flight 
or single-engine maneuvers, be certain that the qualified instructor pilot has a full set of 
operable controls available."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's inadequate supervision of the flight, the flightcrew not maintaining 
control of the airplane, and the flight instructor's delayed remedial action which resulted in the 
inadvertent spin.  Factors to the accident were the inadvertent spin and the CFI's decision to 
operate the airplane with the flight instructor's seat secured in the full-aft position.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On December 3, 2000, at 1515 central standard time (cst), a Beech 95-B55, N7678N, sustained 
substantial damage during an in-flight collision with the terrain following a loss of aircraft 
control while maneuvering near Milltown, Wisconsin.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed at the time of the accident.  The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 CFR 
Part 91 and was not on a flight plan.  The certified flight instructor (CFI) and the dual student 
were fatally injured.  The local instructional flight departed the St. Paul Downtown Holman 
Field Airport, St. Paul, Minnesota, about 1448.
Aircraft radar track data for the period before and after the reported accident time was 
obtained from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Control.  The obtained data 
indicated there was a single aircraft, which was transmitting a visual flight rules (VFR) 1200 
transponder beacon code, maneuvering near the accident location about the time of the 
accident.  The last two minutes of radar data were recorded as:

A plot of the aircraft radar track data was generated, and is appended to this factual report 
along with a copy of the source data.
A witness, located near the accident site, reported in a written statement, "...heard an airplane 
coming over then the motor shut off and the plane started to fall, spiraling down until it hit the 
ground..."
Another witness, at the same location, reported in a written statement, "...heard a small plane 
overhead the motored stop or shut off I was watching it drop out of the sky.  My first idea was 
start your engine[.]  It just kept twisting coming down[.]  [When] it got about 300 ft of the 
ground I knew there was no hope[.]  About 3 sec. after the crash there was a loud bang."

A hunter, located near the accident site, reported in a written statement, "About 320 I heard a 
plane came from the S-SW and was traveling N.  When it was west of me the sound of the 
engin[e] was fluctuating from a high pitch to a low pitch. Then the plane was North and it 
turned around.  I heard it coming back and all at once the sound of the engine stopped.  About 
2 Min. later I heard a crashing sound to the N.E. of me."
Copies of the written witness statements are appended to this factual report.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) on-scene investigation began on December 
4, 2000.
A global positioning system (GPS) receiver reported the accident site position as 45-degrees 
32-minutes 17-seconds north latitude, 92-degrees 26-minutes 44-seconds west longitude, at 
approximately 1,276 feet msl.  The accident site was located south of 230th Avenue and east of 
140th Street in the township of Milltown, Wisconsin.
The aircraft was found nose down in a wooded area.  The angle between the terrain and the 
lower fuselage was approximately 50 degrees.  All components of the aircraft were located at 
the accident site.  The left wing was bent forward and the right wing was bent rearward.  The 
entire leading edge of the right wing was buckled rearward against forward wing spar.  The 
leading edge of the left wing had crush damage along its entire length.  The left horizontal 
stabilizer and elevator were separated from the fuselage.  The right horizontal stabilizer and 
elevator remained attached to the fuselage.  The leading edge of the right horizontal stabilizer 
had multiple crush zones that were semicircular in shape.  The rudder remained attached to 
the vertical stabilizer.  Flight control continuity was established for the rudder, aileron, and 
elevator flight controls.  Both engine nacelles were bent to the left and both engines remained 
attached to the airframe.  The flaps were extended to the 30 degree position.  The landing gear 
was extended.  Both fuel selectors were in the main tank position.  The main wing tanks were 
ruptured. 
The CFI occupied the right seat during the accident flight.  The right seat was secured in the 
full aft position.  There was a handwritten placard that stated, "right seat fixed in the aft 
position."  Four pillows were recovered at the accident site.  An officer with the Polk County 
Sheriff Department reported that one of the pillows was found beneath the CFI and that there 
were two pillows behind her back.  The forth pillow was found lying between the CFI and the 
dual student.  See attached Polk County Sheriff Department Incident Report.
No additional anomalies were found with respect to the airframe or its flight control systems 
that could be associated with a pre-impact condition.
Left engine crankshaft and valve train continuity was established by rotating the crankshaft at 
the propeller flange. There was thumb compression on all cylinders.  There was fuel in the lines 
Page 7 of 11CHI01FA044
leading to the fuel controller, in the fuel controller, and in the flow-divider.  The fuel screen was 
noted to be wet, clear of debris, and had an odor that was consistent with aviation fuel.  Both 
magnetos produced spark on all leads when rotated by hand.
Right engine crankshaft and valve train continuity was established by rotating the crankshaft at 
the propeller flange. There was thumb compression on all cylinders.  There was fuel in the lines 
leading to the fuel controller, in the fuel controller, and in the flow-divider.  The fuel screen was 
noted to be wet, clear of debris, and had an odor that was consistent with aviation fuel.  Both 
magnetos produced spark on all leads when rotated by hand. 
No anomalies were found with either engine, or their related systems, that could be associated 
with a pre-impact condition.
Both propellers remained attached to their respective engines.  The left propeller's blades were 
bent aft and had minor impact surface damage.  One of the right propeller's blades was bent aft 
and both blades had minor impact surface damage.  
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
An autopsy was performed on the CFI at the Ramsey County Medical Examiner's Office, St. 
Paul, Minnesota, on December 4, 2000.
A Forensic Toxicology Fatal Accident Report was prepared by the FAA Civil Aeromedical 
Institute, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for the CFI.
The toxicology results for the CFI were:
* No Carbon Monoxide detected in Blood
* No Cyanide detected in Blood
* No Ethanol detected in Blood
* No Drugs detected in Blood
An autopsy was performed on the dual student at the Ramsey County Medical Examiner's 
Office, St. Paul, Minnesota, on December 4, 2000.
A Forensic Toxicology Fatal Accident Report was prepared by the FAA Civil Aeromedical 
Institute, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for the dual student.
The toxicology results for the dual student were:
* No Carbon Monoxide detected in Blood
* No Cyanide detected in Blood
* No Ethanol detected in Urine
* No Drugs detected in Urine
TESTS AND RESEARCH
On November 22, 2000, the co-pilot's forward/aft seat-positioning system was listed as 
inoperative on an Aircraft Dispatch Approval Sheet.  The Aircraft Dispatch Approval Sheet 
indicated the corrective action was, "... co-pilot seat need parts. (parts on order) seat locked in 
aft position."  The seat was not repaired prior to the accident flight.  A copy of the Aircraft 
Dispatch Approval Sheet is appended to this factual report.
Page 8 of 11CHI01FA044
The accident airplane was reported to be completely full of fuel prior to the accident flight.  
Copies of a fueling statement and fueling log are appended to this factual report.
The Pilot Operating Handbook (POH) for the Beech 95-B55 aircraft states that Federal 
Aviation Regulations (FAR) did not require spin demonstration for certification and that no 
spin tests were conducted during the certification process.  The POH states that the recovery 
technique listed is "... based on the best available information."  The POH states that recovery 
from a spin will become more difficult if the pilot delays taking corrective action.  
The POH states, "Always remember that extra alertness and pilot techniques are required for 
slow flight maneuvers, including the practice or demonstration of stalls or [flight at minimum 
controllable airspeed]."
The POH further states that, "Whenever a student pilot will be required to practice slow flight 
or single-engine maneuvers, be certain that the qualified instructor pilot has a full set of 
operable controls available.  FAA regulations prohibit flight instruction without full dual 
controls."
POH selections covering spins and spin recovery techniques are appended to this factual 
report.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
