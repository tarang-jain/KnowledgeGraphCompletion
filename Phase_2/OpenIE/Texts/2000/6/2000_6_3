Location:
THIBODAUX, LA
Accident Number:
FTW00LA162
Date & Time:
06/01/2000, 0820 CDT 
Registration:
N5028Q
Aircraft:
Air Tractor AT-401B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The pilot flew the agricultural airplane around the target area (crawfish pond) to be sprayed, 
'looking for obstacles and wind direction.'  The pilot made the first spray run from the north to 
the south, and the second pass from the south to north.  After completing the second run, the 
pilot passed over power lines and executed a turn to the right and into the direction of the sun.  
According to the pilot, the sunlight and glare on the windscreen 'blocked my vision' 
temporarily.  While still in the turn, the pilot regained 'forward vision' and realized the airplane 
was flying 'into the power lines.'  After striking the power lines, the airplane came to rest 
upright in the crawfish pond. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance with the power lines while maneuvering during an 
aerial application flight. A factor was the sunglare on the windscreen. 
Findings

Phase of Operation: MANEUVERING - AERIAL APPLICATION
Findings
1. OBJECT - WIRE,TRANSMISSION
2. (C) CLEARANCE - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND

Factual Information
 On June 1, 2000, at 0820 central daylight time, an Air Tractor AT-401B agricultural airplane, 
N5028Q, struck a power line during an aerial application flight near Thibodaux, Louisiana.  
The airplane was owned and operated by Golden Ranch Aviation, Inc., of Schriever, Louisiana, 
under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137.  The commercial pilot, sole occupant, received 
serious injuries, and the airplane sustained substantial damage.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed for the local flight, and a flight plan was not filed.  The flight originated 
approximately 0800 from the Golden Ranch Aviation, Inc., private airstrip.
According to the pilot's statement, the pilot circled the target area (a crawfish pond, located 
approximately 10-12 miles northwest of the airstrip) to be sprayed, "looking for obstacles and 
wind direction."  The pilot made the first spray run from the north to the south, and the second 
pass from the south to north.  After completing the second run, the pilot passed over power 
lines and executed a turn to the right and into the direction of the sun.  According to the pilot, 
the sunlight and glare on the windscreen "blocked [his] vision" temporarily.  While still in the 
turn, the pilot regained "forward vision" and realized the airplane was flying "into the power 
lines."  After striking the power lines, the airplane came to rest upright in the crawfish pond.  
According to the U.S. Naval Observatory Astronomical Applications Department, the official 
sunrise on June 1, 2000, occurred at 0603.  
According to the FAA inspector, who examined the wreckage, the wings sustained spar 
damage, and the propeller was damaged.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
