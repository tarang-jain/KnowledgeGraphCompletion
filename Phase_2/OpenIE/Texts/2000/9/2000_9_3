Analysis 
The pilot reported he was preparing to land on runway 36 (2,200 feet by 150 feet, dry grass) 
when another airplane on the ground had its engine quit.  This airplane was stopped on the 
east edge of the 150-foot wide airstrip, approximately 1,200 feet from the approach end of the 
runway.  The pilot attempted to go around, but did not add full power.  He reported the 
airplane stalled and the left wing dropped.  The pilot reported that he added full power, 
however, the airplane impacted the terrain off the west wide of the airstrip. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot failed to add full power during a go around which resulted in descreased airspeed and 
a subsequent stall.  A factor associated with the accident was the airplane stopped on the edge 
of the airstrip.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
