Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The certificated commercial pilot started a southeasterly takeoff run on a 700 feet long airstrip.  
He added that the airplane's acceleration was slow due to wet, tundra-covered terrain.  As the 
airplane neared the end of the airstrip, just before it became airborne, he turned the airplane to 
the left to avoid striking a truck parked at the end of the airstrip, and the left wing struck a 
cabin at the end of the airstrip.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and 
fuselage.  The pilot said that there were no preaccident mechanical anomalies with the 
airplane. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's selection of an unsuitable takeoff area.  Factors associated with the accident were 
wet and soft terrain.

Factual Information
 On October 1, 2000, about 1900 Alaska daylight time, a tundra tire equipped Piper PA-18-160 
airplane, N59645, sustained substantial damage during takeoff from a remote airstrip, about 15 
miles west of Naknek, Alaska, at 58 degrees, 43 minutes north latitude, 157 degrees, 01 minutes 
west longitude.  The certificated commercial pilot, and the one passenger aboard, were not 
injured. The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) personal flight under 
Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, 
and no flight plan was filed.  The flight originated about 1750, from the Naknek Airport, 
Naknek.   
During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-
in-charge on October 2, the pilot reported that as he started a southeasterly takeoff run on a 
700 feet long remote airstrip, the airplane's acceleration was slow due to wet, tundra-covered 
terrain.  He said that as he neared that end of the site, just before the airplane became 
airborne, he turned the airplane to the left to avoid striking a truck parked at the end of the 
airstrip, and the left wing struck a cabin at the end of the takeoff area.  The airplane sustained 
substantial damage to both wings and fuselage.   
The pilot said that there were no preaccident mechanical anomalies with the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
