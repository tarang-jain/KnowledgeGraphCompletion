Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
After about 15 minutes on a 'Hare and Hound' flight, the pilot noticed a drop in fuel pressure 
(while flying at a low altitude). He switched fuel tanks, but the balloon had begun to descend. 
The pilot attempted to stop the descent by using a good tank, but the balloon continued to lose 
altitude and landed hard on flat terrain, before the descent could be stopped. The pilot and 
other pilots reported low level wind shear in the area at the time. No mechanical malfunction 
was reported. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's inadequate in-flight planning, which resulted in an excessive descent and 
subsequent hard landing, due to a drop in fuel pressure along with shifting winds at low 
altitude.

Factual Information
 On March 1, 1997, at 0815 hours mountain standard time, a Balloon Works AX-8B, N9033H, 
owned and operated by the pilot, collided with the ground near Parker, Arizona, during a local 
pleasure flight.  The balloon was not damaged and the pilot and one of two passengers onboard 
were not injured.  The other passenger received a serious injury to the ankle.  Visual 
meteorological conditions existed at the time.
According to the pilot, after 15 minutes of flight, he noticed a drop in fuel pressure and 
switched to another tank with the balloon making a corresponding drop in altitude and change 
in direction.  A continuous application of the burner blast valve did not stop the rate of descent 
and a hard landing occurred.
The pilot stated that the loss of the propane fuel pressure in the number 2 tank just prior to the 
changeover to the number 4 tank, along with a wind shear, caused the balloon to collide with 
the ground.  Wind shears were reported by several balloonists upon debriefing their flights 
later that morning.  The pilot operator report did not indicate a mechanical malfunction or 
failure.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
