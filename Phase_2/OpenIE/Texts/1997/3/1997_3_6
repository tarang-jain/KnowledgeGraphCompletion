Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
MORRISTOWN, AZ
Accident Number:
LAX97LA116
Date & Time:
03/02/1997, 1750 MST 
Registration:
N39W
Aircraft:
Beech J35
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
While in cruise flight the pilot felt a slight vibration and immediately made a power change 
without affect.  After reducing the engine rpm from 2300 to 2100, the airplane vibrated hard 
for a split second and then smoothed out.  At that point, the propeller had separated from the 
engine with part of the crankshaft.  Metallurgical examination of the crankshaft revealed that 
the fatigue failure occurred inside the crankshaft bore 1.7 inches forward of the crankshaft oil 
seal.  The point of origin was at two corrosion pits. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
failure of the crankshaft due to improper inspection/overhaul procedures. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: LOSS OF ENGINE POWER(TOTAL) - MECH FAILURE/MALF
Phase of Operation: CRUISE - NORMAL
----------
Occurrence #2: FORCED LANDING
Phase of Operation: CRUISE - NORMAL
----------
Occurrence #3: NOSE OVER
Phase of Operation: EMERGENCY LANDING

Factual Information
 On March 2, 1997, about 1750 hours mountain standard time, a Beech J35, N39W, was 
substantially damaged during a forced landing at Morristown, Arizona.  The pilot received 
minor injuries and the passenger received serious injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed for the personal cross-country flight and no flight plan was filed. 
The pilot reported that while in cruise flight he felt a vibration and immediately made a power 
change without affect.  He further reduced the engine rpm from 2,300 to 2,100, the airplane 
vibrated hard for a split second and then smoothed out.  At that point, the propeller separated 
from the engine with part of the crankshaft.  The failure occurred over remote desert terrain 
and the propeller was not recovered.
ENGINE INFORMATION
According to the engine logbook, the engine had been overhauled on April 11, 1989, at 1,819 
total hours.  At the time of the accident, the engine had accumulated about 937 hours since the 
overhaul. 
Postaccident metallurgical examination of the crankshaft revealed that it had failed 
approximately 1.7 inches forward of the crankshaft oil seal.  From this fatigue cracking origin, it 
propagated at a 45-degree angle to the axis of the crankshaft forward and aft.  The origin was 
located inside the crankshaft bore at two corrosion pits.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
