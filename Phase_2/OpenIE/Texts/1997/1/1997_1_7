Factual Information
 On January 2, 1997, about 1700 eastern standard time, a Cessna 172N, N1445E, landed 
hard at the Anderson County Airport, Anderson, South Carolina. The airplane was operated 
under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91, and visual flight rules. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed. A flight plan was not filed for the personal flight. The private pilot and his 
passenger were not injured, and the airplane was substantially damaged. Origination of the 
flight was Augusta, Georgia, about 1615, on the same day.
The pilot reported that his approach to landing was acceptable, crossing the threshold at 
60 knots. At touch down the airplane ballooned, then porpoised three times onto the nose 
landing gear. The pilot examined the airplane after it had stopped on the runway. The nose 
gear was bent rearward and the fuselage underside was wrinkled. The pilot also indicated that 
it was his first flight in a 172, with his prior experience all in a 150. He stated that he received a 
checkout from the same FBO in a 152 in August 1996. When he rented the airplane for this 
flight, he was assigned N1445E.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
