Location:
LAKE WALES, FL
Accident Number:
MIA97LA157
Date & Time:
05/02/1997, 1415 EDT 
Registration:
N14525
Aircraft:
Thacker STARDUSTER TOO SA300
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
During the takeoff roll, the aircraft drifted to the right, and application of left rudder did not 
correct the drift. The aircraft went off the right side of the runway, and the pilot aborted the 
takeoff. With application of left brake the aircraft nosed over in the soft ground. The pilot 
stated he had no mechanical difficulties with the aircraft and that he believed the tail wheel did 
not lock in the center detent during the start of the takeoff roll. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
failure of the tail wheel to lock in the centered detent during the beginning of the takeoff roll, 
which resulted in the pilot being unable to maintain directional control and the aircraft drifting 
off the runway and nosing over in the soft ground.

Factual Information
 On May 2, 1997, about 1415 eastern daylight time, a Thacker Starduster Too SA300, 
N14525, registered to an individual, nosed over during an aborted takeoff at Lake Wales 
Airport, Lake Wales, Florida, while on a Title 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight from Lake Wales 
to Jacksonville, Florida. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight 
plan was filed. The aircraft received substantial damage and the airline transport-rated pilot 
was not injured. The flight was originating at the time of the accident. 
The pilot stated that during takeoff on runway 6, the aircraft started drifting to the right 
while still at low speed. Application of left rudder did not correct the drift and the right main 
landing gear tire went off the edge of the runway. The aircraft was traveling at about 30 knots 
at this time. The aircraft continued to drift right and he aborted the takeoff. After closing the 
throttle he applied left brake and rudder in an attempt to turn the aircraft back onto the hard 
surface of the runway. Immediately upon application of the left brake the aircraft nosed over in 
the soft ground. The pilot stated there was no mechanical malfunctions with the aircraft and he 
believed that the tail wheel did not lock in the centered detent as he began his takeoff roll.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
