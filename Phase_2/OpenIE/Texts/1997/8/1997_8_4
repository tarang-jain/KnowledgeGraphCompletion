Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
SPARTA, WI
Accident Number:
CHI97LA246
Date & Time:
08/01/1997, 1320 CDT 
Registration:
N654Y
Aircraft:
Young RV-4
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that during landing, a gust of wind caught the airplane, and it bounced. He 
added power to smooth out the landing, but it bounced once again. He then added full power in 
an attempt to go-around, but he noticed the engine was vibrating from the propeller having 
struck the runway. He reduced the power to idle, and then the airplane descended and 
contacted the terrain off the right side of the runway. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions, and his improper recovery from a 
bounced landing, which resulted in an improper flare and hard landing.  The gusty wind was a 
related factor. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: HARD LANDING
Phase of Operation: LANDING - FLARE/TOUCHDOWN
Findings
1. (F) WEATHER CONDITION - GUSTS
2. (C) COMPENSATION FOR WIND CONDITIONS - INADEQUATE - PILOT IN COMMAND
3. (C) RECOVERY FROM BOUNCED LANDING - IMPROPER - PILOT IN COMMAND
4. (C) FLARE - NOT ATTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND

Factual Information
 On August 1, 1997, at 1320 central daylight time (cdt), a Young RV-4, N654Y, operated by a 
commercial pilot collided with the terrain while landing on runway 19 (4,295' x 100') at the 
Fort McCoy Airport, Sparta, Wisconsin.  The 14 CFR Part 91 flight was operating in visual 
meteorological conditions without a flight plan.  The airplane was substantially damaged.  The 
pilot and passenger were not injured.  The flight originated from Yankton, South Dakota, at 
approximately 1100 cdt.
The pilot reported he was intending to land at Sparta for fuel while en route to Oshkosh.  He 
reported that he chose to make a wheel landing since the wind was greater than 10 knots and 
not directly down the runway.  The pilot continued to report that upon landing, a gust of wind 
was encountered and the airplane bounced.  He applied power, but the airplane bounced one 
more time.  He reported he then added full power to perform a go- around but the engine was 
vibrating from the propeller having struck the runway.  He reported, "I immediately went to 
idle power and attempted to lower the nose but suspect I stalled."  The airplane descended and 
impacted the terrain off the right side of the runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
