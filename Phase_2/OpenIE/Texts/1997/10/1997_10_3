Factual Information
 On October 1, 1997, at 1945 central daylight time, a Piper PA-28R-200, N1092X, piloted by a 
private pilot, was substantially damaged during an off-airport forced landing following a total 
loss of engine power.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  
The 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight was not operating on a flight plan.  The pilot reported no 
injuries.  The flight departed Iowa City, Iowa, at 1725 with the intended destination of 
Nebraska City, Nebraska.
The pilot stated that the engine lost power and he conducted a forced landing in a corn field.  
He made no statement as to the location of the fuel selector and did not indicate that he 
changed it from one tank to another prior to the loss of power.
On inspection of the airplane the fuel in the right fuel tank was close to the top of the filler.  
The left tank was found to have only unusable fuel.  On initial inspection the fuel selector was 
found on the left tank position.  The Federal Aviation Administration Maintenance Inspector 
who inspected the wreckage reported  he opened the fuel gascolator drain which the fuel tank 
selector still on the left tank and no fuel came out.  When the selector was positioned to the 
right tank fuel ran out of the gascolator drain.  The inspector's statement is attached to this 
report.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
