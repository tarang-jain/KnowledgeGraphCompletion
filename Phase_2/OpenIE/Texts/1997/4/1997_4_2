Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
CENTERVILLE, AL
Accident Number:
ATL97LA053
Date & Time:
04/01/1997, 1622 CST 
Registration:
N301A
Aircraft:
Catchot HAULER
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that takeoff and climb to 2000 feet were normal. He said that about 20 
minutes after takeoff, smoke filled the cockpit. He also noticed that the engine tachometer 
needle had dropped to zero and the engine had lost power. The pilot, selected a nearby field for 
an emergency landing. The airplane collided with two trees short of the intended touchdown 
point. Examination of the airplane disclosed that the engine was equipped with a dual 
electronic ignition system. Two three-ohm coils were to have been installed on the engine (at 
the manufacturer) as the ignition source instead of magnetos. Examination of the coil 
assemblies disclosed that both assemblies had shorted and that they were not functional. 
Subsequent research disclosed that the three-ohm coils also require the installation of a two-
ohm ballast resistor into the ignition system. No ballast resistors were installed on N301A. 
Also, no airworthiness certificate had been issued for this airplane. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the engine manufacturer's failure to install ballast resistors in the ignition system, which 
resulted in an electrical short in the dual ignition system and subsequent loss of engine power.

Factual Information
 On April 1, 1997, at 1622 central standard time, a Catchot Hauler, an experimental airplane, 
N301A, collided with trees during an emergency landing in a field near Centerville, Alabama. 
The personal flight operated under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91 with no flight plan 
filed. Visual weather conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The airplane sustained 
substantial damage, and the commercial rated pilot received minor injuries. The flight 
departed Bessemer, Alabama, at 1600.
The airplane owner had taken N301A to Bessemer, where he had contracted for another 
builder of the Hauler airplanes to custom build the engine cowling. Since the airplane owner 
was a low flight time pilot, a friend, with more flight experience agreed to fly the airplane back 
to Wiggins, Mississippi,  after the work was completed. 
The pilot reported that the takeoff and the climb to 2000 feet were normal; all systems also 
appeared to have been operating normally. Approximately twenty minutes after takeoff, the 
pilot stated that smoke filled the cockpit. The pilot also noticed that the engine tachometer 
needle had dropped to zero; within one minute, the engine quit. After attempting to clear the 
cockpit of the smoke, and attempting to isolate the source of the smoke, the pilot, selected a 
nearby field for an emergency landing.  The pilot established a final approach to the field. The 
airplane collided with two trees short of the intended touchdown point. 
An examination of the airplane disclosed that the engine was equipped with a dual electronic 
ignition system. Two three ohm coils were installed on the engine from the manufacturer as the 
ignition source instead of  magnetos. Examination the coils assemblies disclosed that both 
assemblies had electrical shorts, and they were not functional.  Subsequent research by the 
owner, disclosed that the three ohm coils also require the installation of a two ohms ballast 
resistor into the ignition system.  No ballast resistors were installed on N301A. An 
airworthiness certificate had not been issued for the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
