The airplane, piloted by a non-instrument rated private pilot, was found destroyed about 2.5 
nautical miles southwest of the departure airport.  Night instrument meteorological conditions 
prevailed at the time of the accident.  Flight control continuity was confirmed and torsional 
signatures on the propeller blades were noted.
The inadequate preflight planning/preparation and visual flight rules flight into instrument 
meteorological conditions by the pilot.  The clouds, mist, and night conditions were 
contributing factors.
