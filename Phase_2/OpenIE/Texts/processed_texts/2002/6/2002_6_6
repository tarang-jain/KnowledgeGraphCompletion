During a landing rollout, the homebuilt airplane's tailwheel spring fractured, and the assembly 
jammed the rudder.  The airplane veered off the runway and came to rest in a drainage ditch.  
The main landing gear collapsed, and the fuselage and wings were damaged.  Previous damage, 
including beach marks and rust, were found on the spring's fracture surfaces.
Fatigue fracture of the tail wheel spring, which resulted in a loss of control and impact with a 
ditch.
On June 1, 2002, about 0700 eastern daylight time, a homebuilt Comp Air 7SL, N753KD, was 
substantially damaged during a landing rollout at Cross Keys Airport (17N), Cross Keys, New 
Jersey.  The certificated private pilot, two pilot-rated passengers, and one additional passenger 
were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time.  No flight plan had 
been filed for the flight, from Old Mans Airport (7N7), Pedricktown, New Jersey.  The personal 
flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
The pilot reported that during the landing rollout on runway 27, the "tail wheel broke."  It then 
jammed into the rudder and elevator, "which caused [us] to lose our steering and control of the 
airplane."
One of the pilot-rated passengers stated that the "tail wheel broke and flipped up between the 
elevator, jamming the rudder and causing the aircraft to skid."  The airplane subsequently 
swerved off the right side of the runway, and came to rest in a drainage ditch.  
According to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, the tailwheel spring fractured 
and jammed the rudder.  The airplane veered off the runway, the main landing gear collapsed, 
and the fuselage and wings were damaged.  Examination of the spring revealed previous 
damage, including beach marks and rust on the fracture surfaces.
