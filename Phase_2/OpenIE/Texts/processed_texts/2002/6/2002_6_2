The airplane was substantially damaged when it veered off the runway during landing rollout 
on runway 18 (2,700 feet by 60 feet, asphalt).  The pilot reported that a gust of wind forced the 
aircraft to turn right and that full left rudder and braking could not straighten the aircraft.  The 
pilot stated that he allowed the rollout to continue onto the grass along side the runway, when 
the left main landing gear sank in sand.  The pilot reported the winds at the time of the 
accident were from 240 degrees at 13 knots gusting to 18 knots.  The maximum demonstrated 
crosswind for a 1977 Cessna A185F is 15 kts.  There is no published maximum demonstrated 
crosswind for the accident airplane, which was a 1973 Cessna A185F.
Directional control of the airplane not maintained by the pilot.  The gusting winds was a 
contributing factor.
On June 1, 2002, at 1340 central daylight time, a Cessna A185F, N185NR, operated by the 
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, was substantially damaged when it veered off the 
runway during landing rollout on runway 18 (2,700 feet by 60 feet, asphalt) at the Necedah 
Airport (DAF), Necedah, Wisconsin.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of 
the accident.  The 14 CFR Part 91 public-use flight was not operating on a flight plan.  The 
airline transport pilot reported no injuries.  The flight originated from the Wittman Regional 
Airport, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, at 1115 and was en route to DAF.
The pilot stated in a written statement, "...After touchdown the aircraft was caught by a violent 
gust of wind forcing the aircraft into a turn to the right.  Full left rudder and braking was 
applied and was insufficient to halt the turning momentum/force of the wind.  Pilot then 
elected to allow roll out to continue on adjacent grass area.  When the aircraft left the runway 
the left main landing gear sunk into the sand causing the aircraft to go up on the nose and left 
wing coming to a stop."
The pilot reported the winds, at the time of the accident, were from 240 degrees at 13 knots 
gusting to 18 knots.
The maximum demonstrated crosswind for a 1977 Cessna A185F is 15 kts.  There is no 
published maximum demonstrated crosswind for the accident airplane, which was a 1973 
Cessna A185F.
The Federal Aviation Administration and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources 
were parties to the investigation.
