According to the pilot, as soon as he lifted the tail wheel off the ground during takeoff, the right 
wing lifted, he lost directional control, and the aircraft ran off the left side of the grass runway, 
into an adjacent hangar. He stated that no mechanical irregularities, or surface wind 
conditions were a factor in the accident. Postcrash investigation by an FAA inspector 
confirmed that mechanical malfunction was not a factor.
Tfhe failure of the pilot to maintain directional control of the aircraft during takeoff roll, 
resulting in an excursion off the left side of the runway and collision with an adjacent hangar.
On April 2, 2002, about 1330 eastern standard time, a Taylorcraft BC12-D, N43615, registered 
to a private individual, operating as a Title 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight, crashed during 
takeoff in the vicinity of Crescent City, Florida. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and 
no flight plan was filed. The aircraft received substantial damage, a hangar received minor 
collision damage, and the private-rated pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured. The flight was 
departing at the time of the accident.
According to the pilot, during takeoff roll from a private grass strip, as soon as he brought the 
tail wheel off the runway in his rotation sequence, the right wing suddenly lifted, causing him 
to lose directional control. The aircraft veered left off the runway and into an adjacent hangar. 
He reported neither surface winds nor runway conditions were a factor in the runway 
excursion. The pilot reported damage to the hangar was limited to an entrance door and 
aluminum siding.
According to an FAA inspector, a postcrash inspection of the aircraft determined that there 
were no mechanical discrepancies that may have contributed to the accident. The pilot agreed 
to taking additional training in tail wheel configured aircraft prior to exercising further solo 
privileges.
