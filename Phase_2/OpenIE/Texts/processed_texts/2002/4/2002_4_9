While landing runway 25 at Gwinnett County-Briscoe Field, the pilot stated the aircraft, "was a 
little unstable", so he added power for a second touchdown attempt. Following his second 
touchdown, the tail of the aircraft skewed, "about 30 degrees [left] and shot on the grass". He 
added power, retracted flaps to 30 degrees, and pulled the main landing gear off the ground. 
He next heard tree branches impact the aircraft, and the aircraft impacted the terrain. The pilot 
stated no malfunctions or failures of the aircraft existed prior to the accident. The FAA 
inspector stated the aircraft did not have the airspeed or available power to successfully 
execute a go around in the configuration the aircraft wreckage was found.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control while landing and during his subsequent 
attempt at a go around, resulting in collision with a tree and impact with the terrain.
On April 2, 2002, about 1600 eastern standard time, a Cessna 150L, N6613G, registered to a 
private individual, operating as a Title 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight, crashed while attempting 
a landing at Lawrenceville, Georgia. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight 
plan was filed. The aircraft received substantial damage, and the airline transport-rated pilot, 
the sole occupant, sustained serious injuries. The flight departed Jefferson, Georgia, about 30 
minutes before the accident.
According to the pilot, the aircraft had been modified to a tail wheel configuration. His landing 
roll-out on runway 25 at Gwinnett County-Briscoe Field was abandoned because a left 
crosswind caused the pilot to touch down right of centerline, and the airplane was a "little 
unstable".  He added power, became airborne to realign with the centerline, and attempted a 
second flare and touchdown when his tail skewed left about 30 degrees off runway heading. 
The aircraft left the runway off the right edge into the grass. He immediately added power for a 
go around, retracted flaps to 30 degrees, and pitched the nose up to get the landing gear off the 
grass. He next heard tree branches hit the aircraft, the left wing dropped, and the aircraft 
impacted the terrain in a 15- to 20-foot deep ravine adjacent to and downwind of the runway. 
The pilot stated no mechanical malfunction or failure of the aircraft or its components existed 
prior to the crash.  Reported surface winds at the airport at the time of the accident were from 
170 degrees at 8 knots.
According to an FAA inspector, after the pilot lost control on his first landing touchdown and 
while attempting a second touchdown from the same approach, the aircraft veered about 45 
degrees off runway 25 to the right, and onto a dirt/grass area. The aircraft next encountered a 
12-foot deep ditch, became airborne, flew into the canopy of a small pine tree, and finally 
impacted the terrain in a 50-degree nose down attitude in a small wooded area in the ditch. He 
stated the aircraft did not have the airspeed or available power to successfully execute the go 
around in the configuration the pilot was using.
