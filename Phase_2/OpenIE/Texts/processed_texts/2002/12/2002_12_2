The pilot said the airplane was parked on a remote beach on an Island.  He noticed an 
approaching storm, and decided to reposition the airplane on a logging road away from the 
beach.  During the landing roll on the logging road, the right wing struck a tree, and as the 
airplane turned sharply to the right, the left main landing gear struck a berm and collapsed, 
allowing the left wing to impact the ground.  The airplane sustained damage to both wings, the 
left landing gear and propeller.
The pilot's selection of unsuitable terrain for landing and his failure to maintain obstacle 
clearance which resulted in the airplane colliding with a tree and a berm.
