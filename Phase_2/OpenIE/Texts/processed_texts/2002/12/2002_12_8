The airplane owner/pilot-rated student stated that after takeoff while flying over the 
Apalachicola River, the CFI advised him that he wanted to demonstrate an engine-out landing 
on water, and took the flight controls.  The CFI landed the airplane on the water then applied 
power to takeoff.  During the takeoff run and on step taxi facing a green colored buoy ahead, 
the CFI asked him what side of the buoy to go on.  The owner/pilot-rated student stated that he 
replied the left side, and the CFI maneuvered the airplane to the left, but a portion of the right 
wing collided with the buoy.  The airplane rotated 90 degrees to the right and came to rest.  
The airplane was taxied on the river to a boat ramp where the airplane was secured.  The CFI 
advised him that the occurrence was an incident and not an accident, therefore; was not 
reportable.  The CFI stated that the training flight departed from Apalachicola Municipal 
Airport with the owner-operator in the left pilot seat, and himself (CFI) in the right seat.  The 
CFI demonstrated a power-off emergency landing on the Apalachicola River and while water 
taxiing approaching a marine channel marker, the aircraft encountered a rogue current or 
submerged object.  The airplane was turned to the right causing the right wing tip to impact the 
channel marker.  The aircraft was then water taxied upstream to a boat launching ramp where 
the airplane was taxied onto land and secured.  The occurrence was reported by the airplane 
owner to the NTSB on February 19, 2003.  The NTSB determined the airplane was 
substantially damaged and was classified an accident.
The failure of the certified flight instructor (CFI) to maintain clearance between the wingtip 
and a water marker bouy resulting in contact with the wingtip.
