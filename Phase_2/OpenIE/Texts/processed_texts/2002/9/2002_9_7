The pilot stated that he estimated that at takeoff the airplane had about 35 gallons of fuel on 
board, and after about 45 minutes, while in cruise flight, at an altitude of 4500 feet, the front 
engine suddenly ceased operating. He stated that he had experienced problems in the past with 
water in the fuel tanks, so he did not declare an emergency, even after unsuccessful attempts to 
restart the engine. He said the airplane was maintaining 120 knots, and fully controllable while 
being only powered by the rear engine. He said that in his mind,  it was only water in the left 
tank, and his destination,  Fort Pierce, Florida,  was only 10 miles away, so he continued to his 
destination.  After contacting FAA Fort Pierce Air traffic Control Tower, the pilot said that he 
then entered a right base, turned on to the final approach course for an approach to land on 
runway 09, lowered his landing gear, set 10 degrees of flaps, and was on final at about 600 feet 
altitude, when all of a sudden the rear engine ceased operating. He said the only area to land 
was a small field on the right, so he turned 90 degrees, and entered a dive to prevent the 
airplane from stalling. The aircraft impacted in an orange grove, rebounded once,  and then 
stopped in a canal. The pilot stated the engines failed due to fuel "starvation", and added that 
"the airplane had not been loaded with enough fuel..."   Prior to the accident, the pilot said that 
there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions to the airplane or to any of its systems.The 
FAA Inspector who responded to the accident scene stated that during his examination he 
discovered no fuel in the fuel tanks, and mimimal fuel at the scene.

The pilot's misjudgment of the fuel supply, and subsequent fuel exhaustion.
On September 1, 2002, about 1253 eastern daylight time, a Cessna T337D, N33N, registered to 
K.R. Aviation Inc., and operated by a private individual as a Title 14 CFR Part 91 personal 
flight, made a forced landing in an orange grove in Fort Pierce, Florida. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. The commercial-rated pilot received serious 
injuries, and the commercial-rated passenger received minor injuries. The airplane incurred 
substantial damage. The flight departed from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the same day, about 
1130.
The pilot stated that he estimated that at takeoff the airplane had about 35 gallons of fuel on
