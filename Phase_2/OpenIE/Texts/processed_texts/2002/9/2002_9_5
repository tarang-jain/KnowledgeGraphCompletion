The student said it was his first solo flight, and he had made an uneventful approach and 
landing. As he was reconfiguring the airplane for takeoff following the touch-and-go landing, 
and as he applied takeoff power, the airplane veered to the left of the runway centerline, into 
the grass and subsequently into a shallow ditch where it flipped over incurring damage. Prior 
to the accident, there had been no mechanical failures or malfunction to the aircraft or any of 
its systems.
The student pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during the takeoff roll/run which 
resulted in the airplane departing the runway and into a ditch where it nosed over incurring 
substantial damage.
On September 1, 2002, about 1000 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 152, N68414, registered to 
and operated by Comair Aviation Academy as a Title 14 CFR Part 91 instructional flight, veered 
off the runway during takeoff at Orlando Sanford Airport, Sanford, Florida. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. The student-rated pilot was 
not injured, and the airplane incurred substantial damage. The flight was originating at the 
time of the accident.
According to the student, it was his first solo flight, and he had made an uneventful approach 
and landing. He said he was reconfiguring the airplane for takeoff following the touch-and-go 
landing, and as he applied takeoff power the airplane veered to the left of the runway 
centerline, into the grass and subsequently into a shallow ditch where the ground had been wet 
after much rain. The nosewheel dug into the soft ground and the airplane flipped over onto its 
back, incurring damage to the wings and fuselage. Prior to the accident, there had been no 
mechanical failures or malfunction to the aircraft or any of its systems.
