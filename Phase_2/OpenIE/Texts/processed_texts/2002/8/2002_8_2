The pilot reported that he was landing on a remote gravel strip when the right main landing 
gear tire/wheel separated from the airplane.  He said the right main landing gear leg then dug 
into the ground, and the fuselage buckled at the landing gear attachment point.  The pilot said 
he examined the right main landing gear axle, and found what he believes was a pre-existing 
crack where the axle failed.
The failure of the axle shaft, which resulted in the separation of the right main tire/wheel from 
the airplane on landing.
On August 1, 2002, about 1630 Alaska daylight time, a wheel-equipped Helio H-295 airplane, 
N50718, sustained substantial damage when the right main landing gear axle failed during 
landing at a remote unimproved airstrip, about 124 miles northwest of Fort Yukon, Alaska.  
The airplane was being operated by Circle Air of Central, Alaska, as a visual flight rules (VFR) 
business flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91, at the time of the accident.  The solo commercial 
pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and company VFR flight 
following procedures were in effect. The flight originated at a remote airstrip along Your Creek, 
about 40 miles north of the accident site.
During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
investigator-in-charge (IIC) on August 2, the pilot said as the airplane touched down, the right 
main wheel/tire separated from the landing gear.  The right main landing gear leg then dug 
into the ground, and bent rearward.  He said the fuselage structure and skin were damaged at 
the right main landing gear attachment point.  He further stated that when he retrieved the 
wheel/tire, he noted that the axle was broken.
The pilot said prior to the accident there were no known mechanical anomalies with the 
airplane, but when he examined the broken axle he said he believed the failure was due to an 
"old crack."
