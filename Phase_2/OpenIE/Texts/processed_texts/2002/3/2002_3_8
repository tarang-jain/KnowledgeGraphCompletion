On the landing rollout the left brake hung up, and the airplane came to rest inverted off of the 
runway.  During an examination of the brakes it was found that the left brake piston would not 
release the disc when manually pushed in.  No further mechanical anomalies were noted with 
the brake system.
The left brake failed due to a stuck piston.
On March 3, 2002, at 1130 mountain standard time, an experimental Fairchild 24W-46, 
N77618, nosed over during the turnoff from landing at the Marana Northwest Regional Airport 
(AVQ), Marana, Arizona.  The airplane, owned and operated by the private pilot under the 
provisions of 14 CFR Part 91, sustained substantial damage.  The pilot, the sole occupant, was 
not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  The cross-country flight departed the 
Casa Grande Municipal Airport, Casa Grande, Arizona, about 1100, and was destined for AVQ.  
No flight plan had been filed.
In the pilot's written statement, he indicated that he made a normal wheel landing.  On rollout 
he applied rudder and then brake to maintain directional control.  He stated that the left brake 
locked up and the airplane went over on it's back.
During retrieval of the airplane, the brake pads were loosened.  Both the owner and the person 
assisting with the retrieval noted that there was no clearance of the brake pads.  When they 
attempted to push in the piston to release the disk they found it could not be moved.  They also 
noticed that the brake pads were discolored.  No further discrepancies were noted with the 
brake system.
