The airplane flipped over as its ski equipped landing gear dug into a snow covered runway 
during touchdown.  The pilot reported that there were no mechanical problems with the 
airplane and that the accident could have been prevented by being more cautious when landing 
on unfrozen earth and wet snow.
The improper planning/decision in runway selection.  The soft runway condition and wet snow 
were contributing factors.
On January 3, 2002, at 1600 eastern standard time, an Aeronca 11AC, N302AC, owned and 
piloted by a private pilot, was substantially damaged during touchdown on runway 18 (1,800 
feet by 300 feet, snow) at a private airstrip called Krieger's Farm Strip located near Lake 
Leelanau, Michigan.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  
The 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight was not operating on a flight plan.  The pilot reported no 
injuries.  The local flight originated from Krieger's Farm Strip at 1430.
The pilot reported that the ski equipped airplane flipped over when its right ski dug into the 
dirt upon touchdown on the 8-inch soft snow covered runway.   He added that there were no 
mechanical problems with the airplane. 
The pilot reported that the accident could have been prevented by "[being] more cautious when 
on skis and earth is not frozen and snow is not hard because of warm temperatures."
