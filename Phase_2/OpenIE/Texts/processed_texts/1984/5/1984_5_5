DURING ARRIVAL, THE PILOT WAS CLEARED FOR A LOC/DME RUNWAY 15 APPROACH TO THE 
UKIAH ARPT. AT 1307 PDT, HE BEGAN THE APPROACH AT THE TUCCI INTERSECTION, 15.5 
MI NORTH OF THE RUNWAY. AT 1311:04 THE LAST RADAR CONTACT SHOWED THAT THE 
AIRCRAFT WAS ABOUT 5 MI NORTH OF THE ARPT. AT 1313, THE UKIAH FSS PERSONNEL 
REQUESTED THE AIRCRAFT'S POSITION AND THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE WAS 5.5 MI ON 
THE DME (5.5 MI NORTH OF THE ARPT). THERE WERE NO FURTHER 
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE AIRCRAFT. SUBSEQUENTLY, IT CRASHED ON RISING 
MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN ABOUT 4 MI SOUTH OF THE ARPT AT AN ELEVATION OF 200 
FT. AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE DME WAS SELECTED TO THE #2 NAV 
RECEIVER WHICH WAS TUNED TO THE UKIAH VOR, LOCATED ABOUT 6 MI SOUTH-
SOUTHEAST OF THE ARPT. FOR THE APCH, THE DME SHOULD HAVE BEEN SELECTED 
ON THE #1 NAV RECEIVER WHICH WAS TUNED TO THE LOC/DME AT THE ARPT. THE
