ABOUT 3 MIN AFTER TAKEOFF, THE HELICOPTER WAS OBSERVED DESCENDING IN A 
'GLIDING FASHION' UNTIL WATER IMPACT. A WITNESS REPORTED THAT IT 
APPEARED TO BE FLYING STRAIGHT AND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE IN TROUBLE. THE 
WITNESS REPORTED THAT SHE COULD HEAR THE ENG AND IT SOUNDED NORMAL. 
ONLY THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES, MAST, SWASHPLATE CONTROL ASSEMBLY, 
TRANSMISSION AND ENG WERE RECOVERED.
