THE AIRCRAFT DISAPPEARED FROM RADAR ABOUT 8 MI NORTH OF HANA, HI, WHILE ON 
AN OVER-WATER FLIGHT. WHEN IT DID NOT RETURN FROM THE FLIGHT, A SEARCH WAS 
INTIATED, BUT THE AIRCRAFT WAS NOT FOUND. ONLY THE NOSE WHEEL STRUT (WHICH 
WASHED ASHORE) AND A LIFE VEST (FOUND BY FISHERMEN) WERE POSITIVELY 
IDENTIFIED AS COMING FROM THE AIRCRAFT. THE PILOT AND PASSENGERS WERE 
PRESUMED TO HAVE DIED FROM INJURIES AND/OR DROWNING. THEY WERE 
REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN DRINKING AT A BAR PRIOR TO TO THE FLIGHT; HOWEVER, 
THE PILOT'S PHYSICAL CONDITION AND THE AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL THAT HE MIGHT 
HAVE CONSUMED WERE NOT DETERMINED.
