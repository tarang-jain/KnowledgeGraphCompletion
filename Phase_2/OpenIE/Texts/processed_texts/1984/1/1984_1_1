THE SOUTHEAST SIDE OF LONG LAKE AND SAID HE WOULD 'PASS OVER IN ABOUT 10 
MIN.' AFTER HE TOOK OFF, THE AIRCRAFT WAS OBSERVED IN A LOW PASS OVER THE 
SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE LAKE. THE AIRCRAFT THEN CIRCLED AND BEGAN A 2ND LOW 
PASS. ON THE 2ND PASS, IT DESCENDED LOWER, HIT THE SNOW COVERED, FROZEN 
LAKE, BOUNCED AND CRASHED. WITNESSES SAID LIGHT SNOW WAS FALLING, BUT THE 
VISIBILITY WAS GOOD.
