THE PILOT STATED THAT AFTER TOUCHING DOWN, HE WAS UNABLE TO STOP THE 
AIRCRAFT BEFORE RUNNING OFF THE END OF THE PAVED RUNWAY. HE ELECTED TO GO 
AROUND, BUT FINALLY DECIDED TO MAKE A FULL STOP. A WITNESS REPORTED 
THAT THE AIRCRAFT BOUNCED 3 TIMES DURING THE LEVEL-OFF BEFORE COLLIDING 
WITH A DIRT BANK. ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, THE ENG FLOODED WHEN HE ADDED 
POWER TO GO AROUND. HOWEVER, NO PRE-ACCIDENT/MECHANICAL FAILURE OR 
MALFUNCTION WAS EVIDENT.
