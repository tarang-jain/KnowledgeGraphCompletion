THE PILOT HAD MADE PREVIOUS ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE THE PASSENGER THAT 
WAS TO BE PICKED UP USE THE HEADLIGHTS ON HIS CAR TO INDICATE THE 
DIRECTION OF LANDING. UPON ARRIVAL THE PILOT SAW THE HEADLIGHTS ON THE 
SOUTH END OF THE RUNWAY POINTING NORTH. THE PILOT SUBSEQUENTLY TOUCHED 
DOWN LONG AND RAN OFF THE END OF THE RUNWAY INTO SOFT SAND COLLAPSING THE 
NOSE GEAR AND RIGHT MAIN LANDING GEAR. THE PILOT STATED THAT AFTER THE 
ACCIDENT HE FOUND HE HAD A TAILWIND OF 5-10 KTS.
