THE PILOT ADDED FUEL AND CHEMICALS FOR A TOTAL OF ABOUT 230 GALLONS OF 
CARGO. THE TEMPERATURE WAS 87 DEGREES AND THE ARPT ELEVATION IS 1100 FT. 
THE DENSITY ALT WAS NOT COMPUTED AND PERFORMANCE NOT ASSESSED. AFTER 
TAKEOFF IN A CROSSWIND TURN THE AIRCRAFT 'QUIT FLYING'. THE PILOT SAID HE 'ADDED 
POWER' AND DUMPED THE LOAD BUT HIT A POWER LINE WITH THE TAILWHEEL. 
THE AIRCRAFT BOUNCED AND NOSED OVER. THE ACTUAL IMPACT WAS ON A DOWNWIND 
HEADING AS HE WAS TURNING 180 DEGREES TO SPRAY A FIELD JUST ADJACENT TO 
THE AIRPTRIP. THE PILOT MADE NO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PREVENTION OF 
FURTHER ACCIDENTS OF THIS TYPE.
