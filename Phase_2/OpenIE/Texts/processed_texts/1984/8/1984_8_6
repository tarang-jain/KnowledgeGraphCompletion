DURING A PREFLIGHT WX BRIEFING, THE PILOT WAS ADVISED OF THUNDERSTORMS AND 
INTENSE RAIN SHOWERS ON THE ROUTE OF FLIGHT. HOWEVER, HE FILED AN IFR FLIGHT 
PLAN AND TOOK OFF. DURING FLIGHT, THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL CONTROLLER ADVISED THE PILOT OF A 
LEVEL 6 CELL AHEAD AND NOTED THAT HE HAD NO REPORT ON ITS TOP. THE PILOT 
REPORTED THAT HE WAS 'NOT SHOWING ANYTHING' ON HIS RADAR. ATTEMPTS 
WERE MADE TO DEVIATE. APPROXIMATELY 20 MIN LATER, THE PILOT REPORTED THE AIRCRAFT WAS 
ENCOUNTERING ICING CONDITIONS AND WAS LOSING ALT. AFTER ANOTHER 1 MIN AND 38 
SEC, HE REPORTED 'WE'RE GOING IN.' SUBSEQUENTLY, AN IN-FLIGHT BREAKUP 
OCCURRED. THE WRECKAGE WAS FOUND SCATTERED OVER A 1/2 MI AREA. AN EXAM 
REVEALED THAT THE OUTBOARD WING PANELS HAD FAILED IN FLIGHT. WITNESSES 
REPORTED SEEING EITHER SMOKE OR FIRE IN FLIGHT BEFORE THE AIRCRAFT CRASHED. 
EVIDENCE OF AN ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE WAS FOUND ON THE OUTBOARD 
PORTION OF THE RIGHT WING. HOWEVER, THE PILOT HAD NOT MENTIONED ANY 
ENCOUNTER WITH LIGHTNING ON THIS FLIGHT. NO EVIDENCE OF METAL FATIGUE WAS 
FOUND.
