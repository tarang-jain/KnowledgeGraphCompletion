DURING AN APPROACH FOR A DOWNWIND LANDING, THE AIRCRAFT STALLED AND 
IMPACTED THE GROUND 192 FEET SHORT OF RUNWAY 28. THE PLANE HAD ENCOUNTERED 
ICING CONDITIONS DURING FLIGHT AND ICE WAS STILL ADHERING TO THE AIRCRAFT AS THE 
PILOT MADE AN APPROACH FOR LANDING. INSTRUMENT CONDITIONS EXISTED AND THE 
RUNWAY WAS COVERED WITH SNOW. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE DID NOT ALLOW FOR 
THE ICE AND WAS TRYING TO TOUCH DOWN ON THE APPROACH END OF THE RUNWAY SO 
THAT THE AIRCRAFT WOULD NOT CONTINUE OF THE DEPARTURE END.
