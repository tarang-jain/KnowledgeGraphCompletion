THE PILOTS OF 2 ULTRALIGHT VEHICLES WERE ACCOMPANYING EACH OTHER AND WERE 
FLYING WEST AT 500 FEET AGL IN CALM AIR WHEN AN AIRCRAFEET CROSSED AHEAD OF 
THEIR FLIGHT PATH. THE AIRCRAFT WAS ESTIMATE TO BE FLYING AT ABOUT 140 KTS AND APPROXIMATELY 
40 FEET ABOVE THE ULTRALIGHTS' ALT. THE SURVIVING PILOT STATED THAT HE 
CLIMBED TO CROSS ABOVE THE AIRCRAFT'S FLIGHT PATH. HOWEVER, THE OTHER 
ULTRALIGHT, A PTERODACTYL ASCENDER II, CONTINUED STRAIGHT AHEAD AND 
CROSSED ABOUT 10 SEC BEHIND THE AIRCRAFT. AFTER CROSSING THE AIRCRAFT'S FLIGHT PATH, 
THE ASCENDER WAS SEEN TO SLOW DOWN AND DRIFT TO THE RIGHT, THEN ENTER A 
SPIN AND CRASH. REPORTEDLY, A PORTION OF THE RIGHT WING HAD FAILED BEFORE 
THE ULTRALIGHT CRASHED. NO PREEXISTING CRACKS WERE FOUND. ALL FACTURES 
WERE TYPICAL OF THOSE PRODUCED BY OVERSTRESS.
