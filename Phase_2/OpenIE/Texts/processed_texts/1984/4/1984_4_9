DURING AN INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT, A LANDING WAS MADE DURING WHICH CONTROL 
OF THE AIRCRAFT WAS LOST AND THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH A SNOW BANK HARD 
ENOUGH TO SHEAR OFF ONE OF THE MAIN LANDING GEAR. THE OTHER MAIN GEAR 
COLLAPSED BUT THE NOSE GEAR DID NOT. THE INSTRUCTOR (CFI) SAID HE FELT A 
SEVERE SHIMMY IN THE AIRCRAFT, BUT HE DID NOT REMEMBER WHETHER IT STARTED 
BEFORE OR AFTER THE NOSEWHEEL TOUCHED DOWN. NO PREEXITING 
MECHANICAL PROBLEM WAS FOUND.
