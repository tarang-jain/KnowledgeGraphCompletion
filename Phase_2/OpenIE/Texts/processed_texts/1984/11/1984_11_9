THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH TERRAIN WHILE MANEUVERING NORTHEAST OF 
AUBURN AIRPORT DURING A VFR PERSONAL FLIGHT. THE PILOT ADVISED SACRAMENTO 
TRACON THAT HE HAD AUBURN ARPT IN SIGHT. HOWEVER, TRACON OBSERVED 
N97638 FLY OVER AND PASS AUBURN ARPT IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION AND CALLED THE 
AIRCRAFT. AT THIS TIME, THE PILOT ADVISED TRACON THAT HE WANTED A VECTOR TO 
LINCOLN ARPT, 16 MI WEST OF AUBURN. SACRAMENTO TRACON ADVISED N97638 TO 
MAINTAIN VFR AND THAT HE WAS ENTERING AN AREA OF HIGH TERRAIN. ALSO, HE 
WAS ADVISED THAT WHEN POSSIBLE, HE SHOULD TURN RIGHT OR LEFT TO A 
HEADING OF 240 DEG FOR A VECTOR TO LINCOLN ARPT. THESE INSTRUCTIONS 
WERE ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE PILOT, BUT SHORTLY AFTER THE AIRCRAFT DISAPPEARED 
FROM RADAR. ACCORDING TO RESIDENTS IN THE ACCIDENT AREA, THE GROUND 
VISIBILITY WAS 'ZERO ZERO WITH FOG AND MISTY CONDITIONS.' PRIOR TO 
DEPARTURE ON THIS FLIGHT THE PILOT WAS ADVISED BY FSS THAT 'VFR FLIGHT WAS NOT 
RECOMMENDED.'
