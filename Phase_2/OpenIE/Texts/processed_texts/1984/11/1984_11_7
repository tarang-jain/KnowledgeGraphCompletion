THE AIRCRAFT EXPERIENCED A MAIN GEAR COLLAPSE DURING A LANDING ROLL. THE 
PILOT CLAIMED THAT THE AIRCRAFT SUFFERED A FAILURE OF THEELECTRICAL SYSTEM 
SHORTLY AFTER INITIAL TAKEOFF. THE PILOT LOWERED THE LNDG GEAR BUT WAS 
UNABLE TO ACHIEVE A GEAR DOWN AND LOCKED INDICATION DUE TO THE 
ELECTRICAL FAILURE. THE RIGHT MAIN GEAR COLLAPSED DURING LANDING. THIS WAS 
THE 1ST FLIGHT SINCE AN ANNUAL INSPECTION DURING WHICH THE RIGHT MAIN GEAR 
HYDRAULIC LINE WAS REPLACED. AFTER THE ACCIDENT, THE AIRCRAFT WAS JACKED UP 
ON THE RUNWAY AND A BUNDLE OF SQUAT SWITCH WIRING FELL OUT OF THE WHEEL 
WELL. NO BUNDLE TIE WIRE WAS FOUND. AFTER THE AIRCRAFT WAS MOVED TO LANE 
AVIATION THE ENGINE WAS STARTED AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE 
ALTERNATOR WAS NOT CHARGING. THE AMMETER INDICATED NO CHARGE OR 
DISCHARGE. WITH AN EXTERNAL JUMPER CABLE ATTACHED TO THE GEAR-UP 
RELAY A SUCCESSFUL GEAR RETRACTION WAS PERFORMED. AFTER THE BATTERY 
WAS CHARGED FROM AN EXTERNAL SOURCE, THE ALTERNATOR CAME ON LINE 
WITH 16.1 VOLTS BEFORE DROPPING OFF LINE AFTER APPROXIMATELY 2 MINS. THE 
ALTERNATOR PTS WERE PITTED AND DIRTY. CLEANING DID NOT HELP.
