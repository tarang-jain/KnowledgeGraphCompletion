DURING DARKNESS, A BOEING 747, N93106, WAS BEING TAXIED FOR DEPARTURE 
WHEN ITS LEFT WING COLLIDED WITH THE RIGHT WING OF A BOEING 767 BEING 
TOWED IN THE SAME DIRECTION ON A PARALLEL TAXIWAY. BOTH CREWS HAD 
OBTAINED GROUND CONTROL CLEARANCES TO PERFORM THEIR RESPECTIVE 
OPERATIONS. IN THE AREA OF THE COLLISION, THE TAXIWAYS DID NOT HAVE 
SUFFICIENT SEPARATION FOR SIMULTANEOUS OPERATIONS OF WIDE-BODIED AIRCRAFT 
AND STANDING PROCEDURES FOR GROUND CONTROLLERS PROHIBITED SUCH 
OPERATIONS. THE GROUND CONTROL POSITION WAS BEING WORKED BY A 
DEVELOPMENTAL CONTROLLER IN TRAINING UNDER SUPER- VISION OF A FULL 
PERFORMANCE CONTROLLER. THE AIRCRAFT BEING TOWED WAS BEING MOVED FROM 
GATE 75 WITH THE CALL SIGN 'UNITED 75 TOW.'  THIS CALL SIGN WAS DERIVED BY 
USING THE COMPANY NAME (UNITED), THE GATE NUMBER (75), AND THE WORD 'TOW.'  
WHILE IT WAS BEING TAXIED, UNITED FLIGHT 75 OBTAINED CLEARANCE TO TAXI, BUT 
THE CONTROLLERS SAID THAT THEY DID NOT GET THE CALL SIGNS CONFUSED.
