ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, HE ENCOUNTERED DETERIORATING VISIBILITY DUE TO 
HAZE AND HE ELECTED TO LAND IN AN UNIMPROVED FIELD. THE 1ST APPROACH WAS 
ABORTED; HOWEVER, THE AIRCRAFT TOUCHED DOWN ON THE 2ND APPROACH. AFTER 
TOUCHING DOWN, THE PILOT REALIZED THE FIELD WAS TOO SHORT. HE INITIATED A 
TAKEOFF, BUT THE AIRCRAFT WOULD NOT CLEAR BRUSH AT THE END OF THE FIELD AND 
SUBSEQUENTLY COLLIDED WITH THE BRUSH AND TREES.
