THE AIRCRAFT WAS TAKING OFF FROM AN AIRPORT WHICH WAS AN UNIMPROVED FIELD 
SITE. ACCORDING TO THE PILOT THE AIRCRAFT WOULD NOT ACCELERATE AND CLIMB OUT 
SO HE STALLED INTO THE BRUSH ALONG A CREEK BED. THE PILOT SAID THE AIRCRAFT HAD 
DEPARTED THIS FIELD BEFORE BUT BOTH TIMES HAD A MINIMUM LOAD (PILOT 
ONLY). THE PILOT SAID HE ELECTED TO CRASH IN THE BRUSH BECAUSE OF A RIDGE 
AHEAD THAT WAS IN THE FLIGHT PATH.
