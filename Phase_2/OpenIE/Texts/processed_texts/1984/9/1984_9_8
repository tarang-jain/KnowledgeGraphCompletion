WHILE FLYING AT A LOW ALT LOOKING FOR A SUITABLE LANDING AREA THE PILOT 
NOTICED POWER LINES AT A HIGHER ALT. PILOT INITIALLYAPPLIED HEAT TO THE 
ENVELOPE TO TRY AND CLIMB ABOVE THE WIRES, BUT DID NOT IMMEDIATELY 
REALIZE THE HEIGHT OF THE WIRES. PILOT THEN ADVISED PAX SHE WOULD HAVE TO 
'DUMP IT' AND BEGAN TO PULL THE CORD TO OPEN THE ENVELOPE DEFLATION 
VALVE IN ORDER TO LAND SHORT OF THE WIRES. ONE OF THE PAX, WITHOUT 
OBTAINING PERMISSION FROM THE PILOT, REPORTEDLY USED THE BURNER TO ADD 
HEAT TO THE ENVELOPE AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME. THE BASKET UPRIGHTS AND 
THE CABLES IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE BASKET CONTACTED THE WIRES AT AN ALT 
OF APPROXIMATELY 40 FEET AGL.
