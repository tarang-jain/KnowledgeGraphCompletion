A WITNESS OBSERVED THE GYROCOPTER CIRCLE THE APRT. ON THE SECOND TIME 
AROUND, IT DROPPED DOWN LOW ON THE DOWNWIND LEG AND DISAPPEARED 
BEHIND A SMALL HILL. HE ALSO STATED THE ENG WAS RUNNING AT FULL POWER 
AND THAT HE COULD HEAR THE ROTOR BLADES STRIKE THE GROUND WHEN THE 
GYROCOTER CRASHED. NO PREIMPACT MECHANICAL FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION 
WAS FOUND DURING THE INVESTIGATION. TOXICOLOGICAL TESTS SHOWED THAT 
THE PILOT'S BLOOD/ALCOHOL LEVEL WAS 0.110%.
