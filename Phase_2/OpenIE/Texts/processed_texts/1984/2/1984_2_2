BEFORE 2000 EST WAS NOT KNOWN. AT APPROXIMATELY 2005, THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE 
WAS UNSURE OF HIS POSITION. SHORTLY AFTER THAT, THE AIRCRAFT WAS IDENTIFIED 
OVER A MILITARY FIRING RANGE. THE PILOT WAS VECTORED FROM THE RANGE 
TOWARD OCEAN ISLE, NC. AT 2052, THE PILOT ACKNOWLEDGED INSTRUCTIONS TO 
CHANGE TO MYRTLE BEACH APPROACH CONTROL FREQ, BUT HE DID NOT CONTACT APPROACH 
CONTROL. SUBSEQUENTLY, A FEMALE PASSENGER RADIOED THAT THE PILOT WAS 
UNCONSCIOUS AND THAT THEY WERE LOST. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AND THE PILOT OF ANOTHER AIRCRAFT TRIED 
TO ASSIST, BUT THE PASSENGER WAS EXTREMELY EXCITED AND COMMUNICATION 
WITH HER WAS VERY DIFFICULT. THE PILOT OF THE OTHER AIRCRAFT THOUGHT HE 
HEARD A MALE VOICE IN THE BACKGROUND STATE 'GIVE ME SOME AIR.' 
SUBSEQUENTLY, THE AIRCRAFT CRASHED (AT NIGHT) WHILE IN A STEEP NOSE DOWN.
