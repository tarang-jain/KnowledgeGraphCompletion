THE PILOT HAD RECEIVED A TELEPHONE WX BRIEFING AT 1610 AND AN IN-PERSON WX 
BRIEFING AT 1932, ABOUT 45 MIN BEFORE TAKEOFF. THE LOCAL WX DETERIORATED 
CONSIDERABLY BETWEEN THE LAST BRIEFING AND THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. THE 
AIRCRAFT DEPARTED AT 2016, AND AT 2024 THE AIRCRAFT IMPACTED IN A GRAVEL QUARRY IN A 
90 DEG NOSE DOWN ATTITUDE. THE ACCIDENT LOCATION WAS ABOUT 800 YDS 
WNW OF THE COLLEGE STATION VORTAC, 3 MI WEST OF COLLEGE STATION. AN 
ARRIVING PILOT REPORTED THAT HE OBSERVED A SOLID CLOUD/DECK FROM 1 MI 
EAST OF THE VORTAC EXTENDING WESTWARD WITH GROUND FOG THROUGHOUT 
THE REST OF THE AREA. THERE WERE NO ENTRIES IN THE PILOT'S LOGBOOK FOR THE 
90 DAYS PRECEDING THE ACCIDENT. THE INCREASED FOG WAS DUE TO A LOCAL 
UNFORCAST CONDITION ATTRIBUTED TO 'RIVER EFFECT' FROM THE BRAZOS RIVER.
