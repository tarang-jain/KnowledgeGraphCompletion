THE PILOT STATED THAT HE HAD BEEN PRACTICING LANDINGS AND THEN CLIMBED 
THE AIRCRAFEET TO 5000 FEET ABOVE THE ARPT. HE FLEW AROUND FOR AWHILE TO COOL 
OFF THE ENG AND THEN HE SHUTDOWN IT DOWN TO PRACTICE RESTARTS. AFTER 
THE FIRST RESTART THE ENG WAS SHUT DOWN A SECOND TIME. THIS RESTART WAS 
UNSUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THE PROP HAD STOPPED WINDMILLING AND THIS AIRCRAFT 
WAS NOT EQUIPPED WITH A STARTER. UPON REACHING 2500 FEET MSL, THE PILOT 
BEGAN CONCENTRATING ON THE FORCED LANDING. AFTER ONE CIRCLE OVER THE 
ARPT THE PILOT DETERMINED HE WAS STILL TOO HIGH AND MADE A SECOND CIRCLE. 
DURING THE SECOND CIRCLE, THE WIND, WHICH WAS GUSTING TO 25 KTS, BLEW 
THE AIRCRAFT AWAY FROM THE RUNWAY. THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH A SMALL TREE DURING 
THE FORCED LANDING.
