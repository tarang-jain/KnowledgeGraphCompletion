THE ULTRALIGHT HAD BEEN FLOWN FOR 4 FTLS AND THE PILOT UPON LANDING 
MENTIONED A POSSIBLE CONTROL PROBLEM WITH THE OWNER AND BUILDER. THE 
BUILDER THEN TOOK THE VEHICLE UP TO SHOW HOW FAST IT WOULD GO. AFTER 
ABOUT 30 MINUTES OF FLIGHT HE DOVE ATTHE RUNWAY IN A FULL POWER SHALLOW DIVE 
AND ENTERED A LEFEET TURN AT ABOUT 30 FEET AGL. THE RIGHT AILERON WAS SEEN 
FLUTTERING BY A WITNESS JUST BEFORE THE RIGHT WING MOVED. A FEW 
SECONDS LATER, THE LEFT WING SEPARATED FROM THE AIRFRAME. THE AIRCRAFT 
CRASHED NOSE FIRST AND BOUNCED ABOUT 40 FEET FROM THE INITIAL IMPACT 
POINT ON THE RUNWAY.
