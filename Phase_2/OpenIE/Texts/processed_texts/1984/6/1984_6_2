TAKING OFF FROM AN ABANDONED ROAD NEAR A FISHING CAMP, THE CESSNA 
TURNED BACK AND DESCENDED WITH POWER ON OVER HIS DEPARTURE POINT, 
HEADING INTO THE SUN WHICH WAS LOW ON THE HORIZON. IT COLLIDED LEFT 
WING TO LEFT WING WITH THE MAULE WHICH HAD CLIMBED OUT AT A STEEP 
ANGLE FROM THE SAME ROAD. THE MAULE PILOT STATED THAT HE SAW THE 
CESSNA IMMEDIATELY AFTER LOWERING THE NOSE OF HIS AIRCRAFT, AND 
INITIATED AN UNSUCCESSFUL AVOIDANCE MANEUVER.
