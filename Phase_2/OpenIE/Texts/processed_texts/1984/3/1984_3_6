BEFORE TAKEOFF, A STUDENT AND A COMMERCIAL PILOT AGREED TO RENDEZVOUS AND 
FLY FORMATION WHILE THE STUDENT TOOK PICTURES OF THE COMMERCIAL PILOT'S 
AIRCRAFT. THE STUDENT WAS TO FLY A CESSNA 152, N4861B, WHILE THE COMMERCIAL 
PILOT FLEW A CESSNA 150, N704V6. THEY PLANNED FOR THE STUDENT TO FLY 
STRAIGHT AND LEVEL WHILE THE COMMERCIAL PILOT FLEW AT POSITIONS AROUND THE 
STUDENT'S PLANE. ALSO, THEY AGREED TO COMMUNICATE ON VHF FREQ 122.9. 
AFTER DEPARTING THE ARPT, THE COMMERCIAL PILOT JOINED (RENDEVOUSED) 
WITH THE STUDENT, BUT 2-WAY COMMUNICATION WAS NOT ESTABLISHED SINCE 
THE CESSNA 150 WOULD ONLY RECEIVED (NOT TRANSMIT) ON 122.9. HOWEVER, 
THEY CONTINUED WITH THEIR MISSION. WHILE ON AN EASTERLY HEADING IN 
FORMATION,THE COMMERCIAL PILOT'S PLANE WAS ON THE LEFT AND SLIGHTLY LOW, 
WHEN THE 2 AIRCRAFT CONVERGED AND THE WINGS COLLIDED. THE STUDENT'S PLANE 
WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGE WHILE THE COMMERCIAL PILOT'S AIRCRAFT HAD MINOR 
DAMAGE, BUT BOTH LANDED SAFELY. NEITHER PILOT HAD PREVIOUS TRAINING OR 
EXPERIENCE WITH FORMATION FLIGHT.
