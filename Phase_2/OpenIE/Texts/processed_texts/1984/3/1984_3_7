THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH TREES DURING TAKEOFF. THE RUNWAY WAS SNOW COVERED 
4 TO 6 INCHES DEEP AND WAS ONLY 1800 FEET LONG. THE TAKEOFF WAS ON A 
BEARING OF 130 DEGREES. THE WIND WAS FROM 280 DEGREES AT 14 KTS. THE SKIS 
ON THE AIRCRAFT HAD WHEELS PROTRUDING THROUGH AT THE MAXIMUM SETTING. 
DURING TAXI CONSIDERABLE POWER WAS NEEDED BECAUSE OF DRAG AND SNOW 
DENSITY. DURING TAKEOFF THE AIRCRAFT WAS AIRBORNE 3 TIMES. THE FLIGHT WAS 
UNABLE TO CLEAR THE TREES SO THE PILOT STALLED THE AIRCRAFT INTO THETHINNEST 
TREE AREA. THE PILOT SAID THERE WERE NO PRE-IMPACT MALFUNCTIONS OF THE 
AIRCRAFT.
