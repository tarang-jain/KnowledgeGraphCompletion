FOLLOWING AN UNEVENTFUL APPROACH AND LANDING, THE PILOT WAS TAXIING 
BACK UP THE RUNWAY WHEN THE RIGHT ENGINE QUIT. THE RIGHT SEAT 
PASSENGER IMMEDIATELY NOTED FLAMES COMING FROM THE ENGINE AND 
NOTIFIED THE PILOT, WHO SWUNG THE AIRCRAFT INTO POSITON FOR WIND TO KEEP 
FLAMES FROM THE WING WHILE SECURING BOTH ENGINE FUEL SHUT-OFF VALVES, 
HEATER FUEL SHUT-OFF AND THE AIRCRAFT ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. PILOT ORDERED 
EVACUATION AND ATTEMPTED TO EXTINGUISH FIRE WITH HAND-HELD 
EXTINGUISHER. FIRE CONTINUED TO BURN FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES UNTIL LOCAL 
FIRE DEPT PUT OUT FLAMES. DAMAGE PRECLUDED DETERMINATION OF FIRE 
SOURCE, BELIEVED TO BE A BROKEN LINE OR SEPARATED FITTING IN THE ENGINE 
FUEL SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWES A QUANTITY OF FUEL TO COLLECT IN THE NACELLE 
BEFORE ENGINE QUIT FROM FUEL STARVATION, FIRE IGNITED, AND PILOT CLOSED 
SHUT-OFF VALVE.
