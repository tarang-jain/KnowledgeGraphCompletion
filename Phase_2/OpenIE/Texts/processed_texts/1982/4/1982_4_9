WHILE DESCENDING THROUGH ABOUT 4500 FEET MSL, THE PILOT HEARD A RATTLING 
SOUND IN THE ENGINE AND NOTICED A LOSS OF POWER. HE DECLARED AN 
EMERGENCY AND WAS PROVIDED VECTORS TO THE WADSWORTH MUNICIPAL 
AIRPORT. HOWEVER, HE WAS UNABLE TO REACH THE AIRFIELD. THE AIRCRAFT 
NOSED OVER DURING A LANDING ROLL ON SOFT, PLOWED TERRAIN. AN 
EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED THAT THE CRANKSHAFT FAILED FROM 
FATIGUE.
