THE RIGHT ENGINE WAS STARTED AS THE PASSENGERS COMPLETED BOARDING. 
AFTER THE COPILOT SECURED THE CABIN DOOR AND TOOK HIS SEAT, THE PILOT 
RELEASED THE PARKING BRAKE AND CONTROL LOCK AND APPLIED POWER TO TAXI. 
WHEN A TURN WAS COMMANDED THE NOSEWHEEL STEERING DID NOT RESPOND 
AND THE PILOT APPLIED NORMAL AND EMERGENCY BRAKING WITHOUT EFFECT ON 
THE AIRCRAFTS MOVEMENT. THE PILOT THEN ORDERED THE RIGHT ENGINE SHUT 
DOWN. THE AIRCRAFT CONTINUED TO ROLL ACROSS THE RAMP UNTIL IT COLLIDED 
WITH A PARKED AIRCRAFT. THE OPERATOR HAD EXPERIENCED SIMILAR FAILURES 
DURING THE 6 MONTHS PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT. HOWEVER, ALL EFFORTS TO 
DUPLICATE AND ISOLATE THE PROBLEMS HAD BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL. DURING POST 
INCIDENT REPAIRS, NUMEROUS LANDING GEAR SYSTEM COMPONENTS WERE 
REPLACED AND THE PROBLEM HAS NOT SURFACED AGAIN. NO REASON FOR THE 
ORIGINAL FAILURES WAS DETERMINED.
