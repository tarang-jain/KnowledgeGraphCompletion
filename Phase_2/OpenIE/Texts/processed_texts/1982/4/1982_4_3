THE PILOT OF THE AMPHIBIOUS AIRCRAFT INITIATED A TAKEOFF ON RUNWAY 10. 
WITNESSES STATED THAT THE ENGINE BEGAN LOSING POWER. AFTER TAKING OFF, 
THE AIRCRAFT WAS OBSERVED TO MAKE A SHARP LEFT TURN BACK TOWARD THE 
AIRPORT WHILE STILL AT A LOW ALTITUDE. SOME WITNESSES STATED THAT THE 
ENGINE STOPPED WHILE THE PLANE WAS TURNING. OTHERS REPORTED THAT THE 
ENGINE CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL THE AIRCRAFT CRASHED. THE IMPACT 
OCCURRED ON A HEADING OF ABOUT 310 DEG IN A NOSE LOW, LEFT WING DOWN 
ATTITUDE. THE AIRCRAFT WAS DESTROYED BY IMPACT AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE. 
DURING THE INVESTIGATION, THE ENGINE WAS DISASSEMBLED, BUT AN 
EXAMINATION OF THE INTERIOR PARTS DID NOT REVEAL ANY CONDITION THAT 
WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO AN ENGINE FAILURE.
