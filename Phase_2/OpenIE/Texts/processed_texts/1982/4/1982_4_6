THE PILOT WAS TAXIING TO GATE H-2 TO PICK UP A CHARTER PASSENGER WHEN 
THE AIRCRAFT AND A VEHICLE COLLIDED. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT ABOUT FIVE 
SECONDS BEFORE IMPACT, HE SAW THE VEHICLE APPROACHING FROM HIS TEN 
O'CLOCK POSITION. HE APPLIED THE BRAKES, BUT THE VEHICLE CROSSED IN FRONT 
OF THE AIRCRAFT AND STRUCK THE RIGHT WINGTIP.  THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE 
WAS ESCORTING ANOTHER VEHICLE. HE STATED THAT HE LOOKED BOTH WAYS 
BEFORE ENTERING THE TAXIWAY, BUT DID NOT SEE ANY MOVING AIRCRAFT. WHEN 
HE NOTICED THE PLANE, HE ACCELERATED TO AVOID COLLISION, BUT WAS TOO 
LATE. IT WAS NOTED THAT THERE WAS A BRIGHT MORNING SUN REFLECTING ON A 
WET PAVEMENT THAT MAY HAVE HINDERED THE DRIVER'S VISION.
