AFTER LANDING THE AIRCRAFT, ONE OF SIX ON A NIGHT CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHT, 
THE PILOT TAXIED BACK TO THE APPROACH END OF THE RUNWAY FOR TAKEOFF. 
N129ER WAS PARKED AT THE APPROACH END AWAITING TAKEOFF SEQUENCE SO 
THE PILOT OF N23ER STOPPED ABOUT 30 YARDS BEHIND IT AND SET THE BRAKES. 
HE THEN STARTED TO STUDY THE AIRPORT DIAGRAM WHICH WAS LYING ON THE 
OPPOSITE SEAT. N23ER COLLIDED WITH THE TAIL OF N129ER BEFORE THE PILOT 
COULD STOP HIS AIRCRAFT.
