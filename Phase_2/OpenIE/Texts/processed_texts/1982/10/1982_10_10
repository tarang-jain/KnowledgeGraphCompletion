DURING A LOCAL FLIGHT, THE PILOT MADE 3 LANDINGS ON A 2860 FEET RUNWAY AT 
SPORTSMAN AIRPARK. HE THEN LANDED ON A 2300 FEET TURF RUNWAY AT 
CHEHALEM AIRPORT IN LIGHT AND VARIABLE WIND CONDITIONS. WHILE LANDING 
AT CHEHALEM, THE AIRCRAFT ROLLED BEYOND THE DEPARTURE END OF THE 
RUNWAY, CROSSED A DITCH AND ROAD AND CAME TO REST IN A SECOND DITCH. 
THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE BRAKE EFFECTIVENESS WAS QUESTIONABLE. 
HOWEVER, AN EXAMINATION OF THE RUNWAY REVEALED SCUF MARKS FROM THE 
PLANE'S MAIN WHEELS, BEGINNING ABOUT 150 FEET FROM THE DEPARTURE END. THE 
OWNER OF A BRAKE REPAIR FACILITY STATED THAT THE MARKS INDICATED TO HIM 
THAT BOTH BRAKES WERE ACTIVATED AND LOCKED. THE RIGHT MAIN GEAR FAILED 
WHEN THE PLANE CROSSED THE FIRST DITCH. AT THAT LOCATION, A SPRAY 
PATTERN OF HYDRAULIC FLUID WAS FOUND WHICH WAS TYPICAL OF FLUID UNDER 
PRESSURE. AN EXAMINATION OF THE BRAKES REVEALED ONLY NORMAL WEAR.
