THE PILOT FLEW OVER THE AIRPORT AT NIGHT, SAW THE RUNWAY LIGHTS AND 
ENTERED THE TRAFFIC PATTERN FOR LANDING. ON FINAL APPROACH, HE SAW A 
ROTATING BEACON AND THOUGHT AN AIRCRAFT WAS HOLDING SHORT OF THE 
RUNWAY. AS HE CONTINUED ON FINAL, HE SAW THAT THE BEACON WAS ON A 
VEHICLE. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE WAS DISTRACTED AND STARTED TO GO 
AROUND. HOWEVER, HE STATED THAT HE "FLEW DOWN A LITTLE WAY", THEN 
DECIDED TO LAND. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE AIRCRAFT TOUCHED DOWN ON 
TURF ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY, THEN FLIPPED OVER. THE PLANE CAME 
TO REST IN A TRENCH THAT RAN PARALLEL AND NEXT TO THE RUNWAY.
