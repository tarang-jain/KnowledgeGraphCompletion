THE PILOT HAD BEEN ISSUED AN INSTRUMENT RATING ON 8/6/82 AND HAD 
LOGGED 5.6 HRS SINCE THAT TIME. THE PILOT'S INSTRUCTOR BELIEVED THIS 
WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS FIRST LOW APPROACH IN ACTUAL INSTRUMENT 
CONDITIONS SINCE HE COMPLETED HIS CHECK FLIGHT. A WITNESS STATED THAT 
BEFORE TAKEOFF, THE PILOT APPEARED NERVOUS ABOUT HIS DEPARTURE AND IT 
APPEARED THAT HE NEEDED TO GET SOMEWHERE DESPITE THE WEATHER. AFTER 
RECEIVING A WEATHER BRIEFING, HE DEPARTED ON AN IFR FLIGHT PLAN WITH 
KNOWN RAIN, FOG AND LOW CEILINGS AT THE DESTINATION. DURING ARRIVAL THE 
PILOT WAS CLEARED FOR AN ILS APPROACH TO RUNWAY 12. AT ABOUT THE 
POSITION THAT HE WOULD BE INTERCEPTING A VOR ARC TO TRANSITION TO THE 
ILS, RADIO AND RADAR CONTACT WERE LOST. LATER THE AIRCRAFT WAS FOUND 
WHERE IT WOULD HAVE INTERCEPTED THE ARC IN A LEFT TURN. AT THAT POINT, IT 
HAD IMPACTED THE GROUND IN A NOSE LOW, LEFT WING LOW ATTITUDE. AN 
EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE AND FLIGHT CONTROLS REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF 
MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION OR FAILURE PRIOR TO GROUND IMPACT.
