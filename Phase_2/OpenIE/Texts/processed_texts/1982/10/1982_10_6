WHILE ENROUTE, THE PILOT DIVERTED TO LAKE CITY, FL TO AVOID ADVERSE 
WEATHER. ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, HE PLACED THE LANDING GEAR HANDLE IN 
THE DOWN POSITION WHILE ON THE DOWNWIND LEG. HE EXTENDED THE 
DOWNWIND TO ACCOMMODATE OTHER TRAFFIC, THEN TURNED BASE AND FINAL 
WHERE HE COMPLETED THE BEFORE-LANDING CHECKLIST. THE AIRCRAFT WAS 
LANDED WITH THE GEAR IN ITS RETRACTED POSITION. LATER WHEN THE AIRCRAFT 
WAS LIFTED, A MECHANIC ACTIVATED THE ELECTRICAL MASTER SWITCH AND 
MOVED THE GEAR HANDLE TO THE DOWN POSITION. WHEN HE DID THIS, THE GEAR 
EXTENDED AND THE 3 GREEN LIGHTS ILLUMINATED.
