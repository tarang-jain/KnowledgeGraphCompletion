BEFORE THE AIRCRAFT ARRIVED, THE SNOW COVERED RUNWAY WAS PLOWED. A 
CESSNA 182 PILOT PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THE BRAKING ACTION AS FAIR TO POOR. 
THE AIRCREW DECIDED TO LAND AS CLOSE TO THE APPROACH END AS POSSIBLE. 
THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ADVISED BY NOTAM, TOWER, OR 
FBO OF A SNOWBANK WHICH WAS AT THE THRESHOLD. HE STATED THAT THE 
GROUND WAS WHITE FROM SNOW AND THAT THE SNOWBANK WAS NOT 
DISTINGUISHABLE. BOTH MAIN GEAR WENT THROUGH THE SNOWBANK. THE LEFT 
GEAR FAILED WHICH ALLOWED THE LEFT WING TO SETTLE TO THE GROUND AS THE 
LANDING CONTINUED.
