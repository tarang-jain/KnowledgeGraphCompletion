DURING A RETURN FLIGHT FROM AN OFFSHORE PLATFORM, THE PILOT 
ENCOUNTERED STRONG HEADWINDS AND ELECTED TO LAND AT LAKE JACKSON, 
TEXAS FOR FUEL. HE LACKED A PROPER MODE OF PAYMENT; THEREFORE, HE WAS 
UNABLE TO PURCHASE FUEL. HE DEPARTED FOR GALVESTON, TEXAS WITH 100 KG 
OF FUEL REMAINING. WHILE EN ROUTE, HE LANDED NEAR HITCHCOCK, TEXAS 
WITH A LOW FUEL STATE. THE PILOT LEARNED OF FUEL FACILITIES ABOUT 1 1/2 
MILES AWAY AND DEPARTED WITHOUT PASSENGERS WITH ABOUT 25 KG OF FUEL 
ON BOARD. WHILE EN ROUTE, THE ENGINE LOST POWER AND THE HELICOPTER 
STRUCK POWERLINES DURING A FORCED LANDING AT NIGHT.
