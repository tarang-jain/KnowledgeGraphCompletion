THE PRIVATE PILOT WAS A FOREIGN NATIONAL THAT WAS DISPAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLHED ON A SOLO 
CROSS-COUNTRY TRAINING FLIGHT. HOWEVER, HE DEPARTED ON A DIFFERENT 
ROUTE WITH A PASSENGER. DURING THE RETURN FLIGHT, HE ENCOUNTERED 
DETERIORATING WEATHER AND DECIDED TO LAND AT THE CRYSTAL RIVER 
AIRPORT. A WITNESS OBSERVED THE PILOT LAND WITH A TAILWIND, THEN 
INITIATED A GO-AROUND ABOUT 3/4 OF THE WAY DOWN THE RUNWAY. WHILE 
CLIMBING OVER TREES, THE AIRCRAFT ROLLED LEFT, THE NOSE DROPPED, AND 
THE PLANE CRASHED.
