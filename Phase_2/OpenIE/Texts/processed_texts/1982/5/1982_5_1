THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE REDUCED POWER AT 1000 FEET AND APPLIED 
CARBURETOR HEAT FOR AN EXTENDED GLIDE TO THE SOD STRIP. WHILE ON FINAL 
APPROACH OVER A WHEAT FIELD, THE AIRSPEED BLED OFF AND HE MOVED THE 
THROTTLE TO ADD POWER. HOWEVER, HE REPORTED THAT THE ENGINE HAD 
LOADED UP AND COUGHED. BEFORE REACHING THE RUNWAY, THE LANDING GEAR 
CAUGHT THE WHEAT AND THE PLANE NOSED OVER. THE PILOT HAD NOT CLEARED 
THE ENGINE DURING THE GLIDE.
