THE CESSNA 172 PILOT PERFORMED HIS PREFLIGHT ENGINE RUN-UP ON THE 
TAXIWAY, THEN WAITED FOR A TWIN ENGINE AIRCRAFT TO LAND. HE REPORTED 
THAT AFTER THE TWIN ENGINE LANDED, HE RADIOED HIS INTENTION, DOUBLE 
CHECKED THE FINAL APPROACH AREA, AND WITH NO OTHER AIRCRAFT IN SIGHT, 
HE TAXIED ONTO THE RUNWAY. WHILE THE CESSNA 172 PILOT WAS WAITING FOR 
THE TWIN ENGINE AIRCRAFT TO LAND, A BOEING A75N1 (STEARMAN) PILOT 
EXTENDED HIS PATTERN AND TURNED ON A LONG FINAL APPROACH. THE 
STEARMAN PILOT REPORTED THAT HE DID THIS TO ALLOW THE TWIN ENGINE 
PLANE TO LAND AHEAD OF HIM. AS THE STEARMAN PILOT CONTINUED, HE DID NOT 
SEE THE BEIGE COLORED CESSNA 172 TAXI ONTO THE RUNWAY. HE REPORTED THAT 
THE VISIBILITY WAS POOR FROM THE BACK SEAT. ALSO, THE STEARMAN WAS NOT 
EQUIPPED WITH A RADIO. AS THE CESSNA PILOT ADVANCED HIS POWER TO 
TAKEOFF, HIS LEFT WING WAS STRUCK BY THE STEARMAN'S LANDING GEAR.
