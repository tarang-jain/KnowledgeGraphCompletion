TO 3500 FEET MSL. ABOUT 17 MILES FROM THE DEPARTUREAIRPORT, THE ENGINE 
STOPPED RUNNING. DURING A FORCED LANDING IN A DIRT FIELD, ONE OF THE 
MAIN GEAR FAILED. THE PROPELLERSEPARATED AND THE WINGS AND FUSELAGE 
WERE DAMAGED. AN EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED NO PREIMPACT 
DEFECTS. HOWEVER, A QUANTITY OF SAWDUST-TYPE MATERIAL, SUFFICIENT TO 
INDUCE FUEL BLOCKAGE, WAS FOUND IN THE AUXILIARY LINE. ORIGIN OF THE 
SUBSTANCE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. THE PILOT STATED THAT FROM TAKEOFF 
TO ENGINE STOPPAGE, THE FUEL SELECTOR HAD BEEN POSITIONED TO THE 
AUXILIARY FUEL TANK. THE AIRCRAFT HAD NOT BEEN FLOWN IN A 12-MONTH
