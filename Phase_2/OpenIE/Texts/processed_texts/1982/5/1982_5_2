THE PILOT HAD LANDED IN A FARMER'S FIELD TO RELOAD HIS SPRAYER TANK. 
BEFORE TAKEOFF, HE NOTICED SOME COWS HAD STRAYED ONTO THE STRIP. HE 
DIRECTED HIS LOADCREW ASSISTANT TO TAKE HIS TRUCK AND CLEAR THE COWS 
FROM THE STRIP. AFTER THE COWS WERE CLEARED, THE ASSISTANT PARKED THE 
TRUCK ABOUT 400 TO 600 FEET FROM THE END OF THE STRIP. IT WAS FACING 
PERPENDICULAR TO THE DIRECTION OF TAKEOFF. AS THE PILOT STARTED HIS 
TAKEOFF, A COW RAN ACROSS THE STRIP FROM BEHIND THE TRUCK. FROM THAT 
POINT, THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO AVOID HITTING THE COW. THE RIGHT MAIN 
GEAR STRUCK THE COW AND THE PLANE VEERED TO THE RIGHT AND STRUCK THE 
FENCE.
