WHEN THE PILOT ARRIVED AT ANDERSON, INDIANA, HE WAS UNABLE TO FIND THE 
ACE AIRPORT. HE SAW HUNTZINGER AIRPORT, A PRIVATE STRIP, AND DECIDED TO 
LAND TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHERE ACE AIRPORT WAS LOCATED. DURING AN 
APPROACH TO THE SOD RUNWAY, THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH POWER LINES 
AND CRASHED. THE PILOT STATED THAT THE POWER LINE POLES WERE HIDDEN BY 
TREES AND THE LINES WERE NOT MARKED. THE OWNER HAD OFFERED TO ASSUME 
THE COST TO BURY THE LINES, BUT AS OF THE DATE OF THE ACCIDENT, THE LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT HAD NOT APPROVED THE ACTION.
