MODEL OF AIRCRAFT. AFTER ABOUT 45 MINUTES OF DUAL INSTRUCTION, HE WAS 
INDORSED FOR SOLO FLIGHT, THE INSTRUCTOR DEPLANED, AND THE STUDENT 
TOOK OFF TO FLY LOCALLY. ABOUT 25 MINUTES LATER, THE STUDENT RETURNED 
FOR TOUCH-AND-GO LANDINGS. HE STATED THAT ON DOWNWIND, HE ELECTED TO 
CHANGE THE FUEL SELECTOR POSITION. HE SAID THAT HE REACHED DOWN, 
DEPRESSED THE SPRING CLIP, AND ROTATED THE FUEL SELECTOR HANDLE TO THE 
RIGHT. DURING THE GO-AROUND AFTER THE LANDING, THE ENGINE QUIT AT 
ABOUT 300 FEET AGL. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE AIRCRAFEET CRASHED DURING A FORCED 
LANDING IN AN AREA OF SCRUB PINE AND OAK. REPORTEDLY, THE PILOT HAD 
TURNED TO AVOID LARGER TREES DURING THE LANDING. THE FUEL SELECTOR WAS 
FOUND IN THE "OFF" POSITION (NEAR THE RIGHT TANK POSITION). ABOUT 15 
GALLONS OF FUEL WAS REMAINING IN THE RIGHT FUEL TANK.
