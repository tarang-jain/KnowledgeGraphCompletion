WHILE PERFORMING IN AN AEROBATIC SHOW, THE PILOT ENTERED A SPIN. 
ACCORDING TO A WITNESS, HE ENTERED THE SPIN AT ABOUT 2000 FEET AGL AND 
MADE APPROXIMATELY 5 TURNS BEFORE STARTING A RECOVERY AT ABOUT 500 FEET 
AGL. HE STOPPED THE SPIN, BUT THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT ALTITUDE TO PULL 
OUT. THE AIRCRAFT STRUCK A HILL, CARTWHEELED AND CAME TO REST, INVERTED, 
IN A SMALL RESERVOIR. IT THEN FLOATED TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE 
RESERVOIR AND SANK IN ABOUT 7 FEET OF WATER. AN INSPECTION OF THE 
WRECKAGE REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF AN IN-FLIGHT STRUCTURAL FAILURE OR 
CONTROL PROBLEM.
