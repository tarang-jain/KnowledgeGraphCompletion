WHILE ON A CROSS-COUNTRY BUSINESS FLIGHT THE LEFT ENGINE STARTED 
RUNNING ROUGH. THE PILOT SHUT DOWN THE ENGINE AND DIVERTED TO 
COTULLA, TX, WHERE HE MADE A SINGLE ENGINE APPROACH AND LANDING. THE 
PILOT LANDED WITH A 20 KT TAIL WIND, WAS UNABLE TO STOP THE AIRCRAFT 
WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE RUNWAY, AND CRASHED INTO A WIRE FENCE. THE 
REASON FOR THE ROUGH RUNNING ENGINE REMAINS UNDETERMINED.
