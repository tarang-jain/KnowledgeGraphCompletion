THE PILOT WAS ON A FLIGHT TO DELIVER THE AIRCRAFT FOR ROUTINE 
MAINTENANCE. HE STATED THAT HE LOST RIGHT BRAKING ACTION AS HE WAS 
APPROACHING THE MAINTENANCE HANGER. HE ATTEMPTED TO MAINTAIN 
DIRECTIONAL CONTROL WITH PROPELLER REVERSING, BUT THE LEFT WING HIT 
THE CORNER OF THE HANGER. THE AIRCRAFT THEN PIVOTED INTO THE HANGER 
AND STRUCK A PARKED BEECH 58P, N5408P. AN EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT THE 
HYDRAULIC RESERVOIR HAD ONLY 1/2 INCH OF FLUID. AFTER THE RESERVOIR WAS 
SERVICED, THE RIGHT SHUTTLE VALVE WAS FOUND TO BE LEAKING. THE O-RING 
SEAL CONNECTING THE PILOTS RIGHT BRAKE PEDDLE TO THE SHUTTLE VALVE WAS 
FOUND UNSEATED, ALLOWING FLUID PASSAGE.
