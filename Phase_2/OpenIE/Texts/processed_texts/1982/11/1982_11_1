THE AIRCRAFT WAS ON A ROUND TRIP FLIGHT FROM BARROW, AK TO POINT HOPE, 
AK AND RETURN. AFTER LANDING AT POINT HOPE, THERE WAS A 20 MIN DELAY 
WHILE WAITING FOR THE GROUND CREW. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE RAN THE 
ENGINES FOR SOME 10 MIN OR SO DUE TO THE HIGH WINDS AND COLD. HE STATED 
THAT THE WIND WAS AVERAGING ABOUT 45 KTS AND WAS TOO STRONG TO 
MAINTAIN CONTROL ON TOP OF THE AIRCRAFT FOR REFUELING. THE PILOT 
CALCULATED THAT HE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH FUEL TO RETURN TO BARROW. 
WHILE RETURNING, HE FLEW PAST TWO POSSIBLE REFUEL POINTS AND A THIRD 
PLACE WHERE HE COULD HAVE LANDED. WHILE OVER WATER NEAR HIS 
DESTINATION, THE LEFT ENGINE FLAMED OUT AND THE PILOT INCORRECTLY SHUT 
DOWN THE RIGHT ENGINE. HE WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE RIGHT ENGINE, BUT IT 
SOON FLAMED OUT ALSO. A SUCCESSFUL FORCED LANDING WAS THEN MADE ON 
THE TUNDRA. ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, THE ENGINE FLAMED OUT DUE TO LACK 
OF FUEL.
