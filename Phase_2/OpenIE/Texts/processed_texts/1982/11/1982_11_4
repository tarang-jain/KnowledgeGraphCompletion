DURING A PREFLIGHT WEATHER BRIEFING, THE PILOT WAS WARNED THAT VFR 
FLIGHT WAS NOT RECOMMENDED. ALSO, A FIXED BASE OPERATOR WARNED HIM OF 
THE WEATHER (THERE WERE PAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLHES OF GROUND FOG). AFTER TAKEOFF, FOG 
WAS ENCOUNTERED AT ABOUT 200 TO 500 FEET AGL. DURING A DESCENDING TURN 
BACK TOWARD THE AIRPORT, THE RIGHT WING CONTACTED THE GROUND AND THE 
PLANE CRASHED.
