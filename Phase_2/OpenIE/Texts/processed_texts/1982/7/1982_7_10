THE PILOT STATED THAT HE BRIEFED THE TWO FLAGMEN ABOUT MOVING TO NEXT 
ROW AS SOON AS THE AIRCRAFT WAS LINED UP ON THE SWATH RUN. BOTH 
FLAGMEN MOVED PROPERLY UNTIL ON THE FATAL PASS ONE FLAGMAN DID NOT 
MOVE AND THE AIRCRAFT STRUCK HIM. THE FLAGMAN STRUCK BY THE AIRCRAFT 
DID NOT HAVE PRIOR EXPERIENCE AS A FLAGMAN.
