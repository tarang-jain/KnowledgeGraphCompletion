THE PILOT STATED THAT WHILE HE WAS SPRAYING CROPS, HE LOOKED INTO THE 
COCKPIT DURING A TURN TO CHECK THE AMOUNT OF SOLUTION THAT WAS 
REMAINING. HE STATED THAT WHEN HE LOOKED UP, HE WAS TOO LOW TO 
COMPLETE THE TURN AND MISS THE TREES. HE WENT TO FULL POWER AND TRIED 
TO PULL UP, BUT THE AIRCRAFT STALLED AND COLLIDED WITH THE TREES.
