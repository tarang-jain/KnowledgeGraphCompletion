WHEN THE PILOT ARRIVED IN THE VICINITY OF HIS DESTINATION, HE LOWERED 
THE GEAR AND FLAPS AND DLEW OVER AN OIL RIG. HE DID THIS TO ALERT 
SOMEONE ON THE GROUND TO PICK HIM UP AT THE DESTINATION. AS HE APPLIED 
POWER TO PROCEED TO THE AIRPORT, THE LEFT ENGINE DID NOT RESPOND. HE 
REPORTED THAT THE ENGINE ACTED LIKE THE FUEL HAD BEEN CUT OFF. HE SAW A 
ROAD AHEAD AND ELECTED TO LAND AS HE WAS AFRAID THE OTHER ENGINE 
WOULD LOOSE POWER. DURING THE LANDING, THE LEFT TIP TANK STRUCK A TREE. 
THE AIRCRAFT THEN VEERED INTO A DITCH AND THE NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED. THE 
PILOT STATED THAT HE DID NOT SERVICE THE PLANE BEFORE TAKEOFF. HE 
ESTIMATED THAT 50 GALLONS WAS ON BOARD DURING DEPARTURE. THE ONE 
HOUR AND 25 MINUTE FLIGHT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED ABOUT 280 LBS OF FUEL. 
THE PILOT REPORTED NO MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION OR FAILURE.
