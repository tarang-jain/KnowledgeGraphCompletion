THE PILOT TOOK OFF FROM AN AIRPORT WITH A DENSITY ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 9500 
FEET. AFEETER LIFEET-OFF, THE AIRCRAFEET REACHED AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 100 FEET AGL 
AND THEN STOPPED CLIMBING. THE PILOT INITIATED EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 
WHICH INCLUDED LEANING THE MIXTURE AND APPLYING CARBURETOR HEAT 
MOMENTARILY, BUT THESE DID NOT HELP. WHEN IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT THE 
PLANE WAS GOING TO SETTLE INTO RISING TERRAIN, A SLIGHT TURN WAS MADE TO 
PICK THE MOST FAVORABLE PLACE TO TOUCH DOWN. WHEN THE AIRCRAFT 
TOUCHED DOWN, THE MAIN GEAR WAS DAMAGED AND THE PLANE WENT THROUGH 
A FENCE AND NOSED OVER. AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE PLANE WAS 
LOADED ALMOST TO ITS MAXIMUM GROSS WEIGHT LIMIT. AN INSPECTION AND 
RUN-UP OF THE ENGINE REVEALED NO PREIMPACT MALFUNCTION OR FAILURE.
