A PARTIAL LOSS OF POWER WAS EXPERIENCED DURING TAKEOFF AND A FORCED 
LANDING WAS MADE ON A ROAD. AS THE PILOT WAS LANDING, A CAR PULLED OUT 
ON THE ROAD AHEAD OF THE AIRCRAFT. WHILE MANUEVERING TO THE RIGHT TO 
AVOID THE CAR, THE RIGHT WING STRUCK A ROAD SIGN AND THE PLANE SWERVED 
INTO A DITCH. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE TOOK A FUEL SAMPLE FROM HIS FUEL 
TANK AND AN EXAMINATION BY AN INDEPENDENT LABORATORY REVEALED THAT IT 
CONTAINED FIVE PERCENT JET FUEL.
