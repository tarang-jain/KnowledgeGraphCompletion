THE AIRCRAFT STRUCK THE TOP WIRE OF AN ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION LINE AND 
CRASHED. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE MISJUDGED THE "WIRE DISTANCE" AS HE 
LET DOWN OVER A POND TO BEGIN A SWATH RUN. THE POND WAS AT THE EDGE OF 
THE FIELD THAT HE WAS SEEDING. THE PILOT ALSO SAID THAT THE TOP WING OF 
THE AIRCRAFT MAY HAVE BLOCKED HIS VIEW OF THE WIRES.
