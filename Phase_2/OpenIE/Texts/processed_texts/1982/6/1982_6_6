THE PILOT REPORTED THAT AFTER LANDING AT OZARK, AR, NO FUEL WAS 
AVAILABLE. THEREFORE, HE PROCEEDED TO OBTAIN FUEL AT CLARKSVILLE, AR, A 
DISTANCE OF ABOUT 15 MILES. AFTER TAKEOFF, HE ENCOUNTERED MODERATE 
TURBULENCE, LEVELED AT ABOUT 600 FT, AND REDUCED POWER IN ORDER TO 
REDUCE THE BOUNCING. HE THEN PREOCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH LOCATING 
CLARKSVILLE AND THE AIRPORT ON THE SECTIONAL CHART. AS HE WAS DOING 
THIS, HE FELT THE AIRCRAFT SINK. FULL POWER WAS APPLIED, BUT THE SINK 
CONTINUED. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE AIRCRAFT STRUCK TRANSMISSION LINES WHICH 
THE PILOT HAD NOT SEEN PRIOR TO IMPACT. AFTER HITTING THE LINES, A FORCED 
LANDING WAS MADE ON A HIGHWAY MEDIAN WHERE THE NOSE GEAR SHEARED 
OFF. THE PILOT STATED THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD FLOWN OVER 
MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN AND IN ITS ASSOCIATED TURBULENCE.
