WHILE PATROLLING A POWERLINE, THE PILOT HEARD A LOUD NOISE, SIMILAR TO A 
GUNSHOT, WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM DIRECTLY BEHIND THE FIREWALL. 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT, THE HELICOPTER STARTED TO PITCH UP AND ROLL TO 
THE RIGHT. HE REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER REACHED AN ATTITUDE OF 
ABOUT 60 DEGREES NOSE UP AND 15 DEGREES TO THE RIGHT. HE CLOSED THE 
THROTTLE AND LOWERED THE COLLECTIVE, THEN ENTERED AN AUTOROTATIVE 
DESCENT. WITH THE LATERAL CYCLIC CONTROL APPARENTLY NOT AFFECTED, HE 
WAS ABLE TO STEER CLEAR OF THE POWERLINES, BUT CRASH LANDED IN THE 
TREES. THE PILOT REPORTED A FAILURE OF A BOLT, PN 20-057-4-15D, IN THE 
FORE/AFT CYCLIC SYSTEM.
