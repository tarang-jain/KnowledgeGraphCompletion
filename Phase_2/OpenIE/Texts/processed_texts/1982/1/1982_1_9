DURING TAKEOFF FROM A HARD PACKED SNOW AND ICY RUNWAY THE AIRCRAFT 
VEERED LEFT INTO A SNOWBANK OFF THE SIDE OF THE RUNWAY. THE STUDENT 
PILOT STATED THAT PRIOR TO THE TAKEOFF ROLL HE HAD FULL DEFLECTION OF 
THE LEFT AILERON AND WAS ANTICIPATING WITH RIGHT RUDDER TO MAINTAIN A 
STRAIGHT TAKEOFF ROLL. AFTER REALIZING THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS ABOUT TO 
STRIKE THE SNOWBANK THE STUDENT RETARDED THE POWER.
