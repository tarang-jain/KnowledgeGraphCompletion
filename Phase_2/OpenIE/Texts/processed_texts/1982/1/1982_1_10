THE AIRCRAFEET CRASHED WHILE BEING MOVED ABOUT 150 FEET FROM THE PARKING 
AREA TO A STORAGE BUILDING. THERE WAS ABOUT 2 1/2 FEET OF FRESH SNOW ON THE 
GROUND. THE SNOW HAD BEEN CLEARED FROM THE PARKING AREA IN FRONT OF 
THE STORAGE BUILDING. HOWEVER, A SNOW CAT HAD MOVED INTO THE PARKING 
AREA AND HAD STOPPED AS THE PILOT WAS APPROACHING TO LAND. THE PILOT 
REPORTED THIS MADE THE PARKING AREA UNUSABLE. BEFORE TOUCHDOWN, THE 
PILOT EXPERIENCED A WHITE-OUT CONDITION DUE TO THE HEAVY CIRCULATION 
OF SNOW AND BECAME DISORIENTED. THE AIRCRAFT LANDED HARD IN A NOSE 
DOWN ATTITUDE.
