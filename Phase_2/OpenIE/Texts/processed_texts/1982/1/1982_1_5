THE PILOT STARTED TO TAKEOFF ON A SNOW COVERED RUNWAY IN CALM WIND 
CONDITIONS. HE REPORTED THAT ABOUT 3 INCHES OF SNOW HAD FALLEN SINCE 
THE RUNWAY HAD BEEN CLEARED. IN HIS JUDGEMENT, THE AIRCRAFT DID NOT 
ACCELERATE FAST ENOUGH TO ASSURE A SAFE TAKEOFF, SO HE ABORTED. HE WAS 
UNABLE TO STOP ON THE REMAINING RUNWAY. THE AIRCRAFT CONTINUED OFF 
THE END OF THE RUNWAY AND RAN INTO A SNOW AND DIRT BANK.
