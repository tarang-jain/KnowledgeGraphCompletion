DURING LANDING, THE PILOT PUT THE LANDING GEAR AND FLAP HANDLES IN THE 
DOWN POSITIONS.  HE HEARD NOISES THAT SOUNDED LIKE BOTH HAD EXTENDED 
AND ASSUMED EVERYTHING WAS IN PLACE.  THE PILOT WAS UNAWARE THAT THE 
LANDING GEAR WAS NOT DOWN UNTIL AFTER TOUCHDOWN.  AN EXAMINATION 
REVEALED THAT THE GEAR WOULD NOT EXTEND BY NORMAL MEANS, BUT HAD TO 
BE STARTED WITH THE EMERGENCY CRANK.  LATER, THE LANDING GEAR RETRACT 
MOTOR WAS FOUND TO BE BURNED OUT.  ALSO, THE LANDING GEAR RETRACT RODS 
WERE BENT.
