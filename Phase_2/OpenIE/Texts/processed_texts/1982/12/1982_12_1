AT ABOUT 1430 EST, THE PILOT TOOK OFF FROM FREEDOM FIELD, MEDINA, OH IN 
VFR CONDITIONS. WHEN HE RETURNED ABOUT 3 HRS LATER AT DUSK, THE 
WEATHER WAS ESTIMATED TO BE: 400 FEET OVERCAST, 3/4 MI VISIBILITY WITH FOG. A 
FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR HEARD THE PLANE FLY OVER THE AIRPORT JUST PRIOR TO 
THE ACCIDENT. HE HEARD A CONTINUOUS SOUND FROM THE ENGINE UNTIL THE 
PLANE CRASHED ABOUT 3/4 MI EAST OF THE AIRPORT IN A WOODED AREA. INITIAL 
IMPACT OCCURRED WITH TREES AT ABOUT 60 FEET AGL WHILE ON A HEADING OF 
APPROXIMATELY 220 DEG. THE AIRCRAFEET REMAINED AIRBORNE FOR ABOUT ANOTHER 100 FEET 
WHERE IT STRUCK ANOTHER TREE AND THE RIGHT WING SEPARATED. THE MAIN 
WRECKAGE CAME TO REST 458 FEET FROM THE INITIAL IMPACT POINT. NO EVIDENCE 
WAS FOUND OF A WEATHER BRIEFING PRIOR TO THE FLIGHT.
