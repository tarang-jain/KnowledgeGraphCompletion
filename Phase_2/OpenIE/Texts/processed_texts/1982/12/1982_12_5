SHORTLY AFTER CLIMBOUT FROM DENVER THE FIRST OFFICER NOTICED THE 
CAPTAIN TWITCH AND ASKED IF HE WAS OKAY. THE CAPTAIN ANSWERED 
AFFIRMATIVELY BUT DONNED HIS OXYGEN MASK AT THE CO-PILOT'S SUGGESTION. 
ABOUT 20 MINUTES LATER THE CAPTAIN STIFFENED WITH HIS LEFT FOOT PRESSING 
THE LEFEET RUDDER PEDAL AS THE AIRCRAFEET DESCENDED THROUGH 10000 FEET 
APPROACHING BOISE. A STEWARDESS AND PASSENGER REMOVED THE CAPTAIN 
FROM HIS SEAT AND LAID HIM ON THE FLOOR. THE CO-PILOT DECLARED AN 
EMERGENCY AND CONTINUED THE APPROACH, LANDING WITHOUT FURTHER 
INCIDENT. AN AMBULANCE MET THE FLIGHT AND TOOK THE CAPTAIN TO THE 
HOSPITAL. EKG AND BLOOD CHEMISTRY TESTS SHOWED RESULTS COMPATIBLE 
WITH MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.
