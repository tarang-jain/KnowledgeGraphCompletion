THE PILOT REPORTED THAT WHILE ON FINAL APPROACH TO LAND, FULL FLAPS 
WERE EXTENDED AS THE AIRCRAFT CROSSED OVER A HILL IMMEDIATELY BEFORE 
THE RUNWAY THRESHOLD. AFTER FULL FLAPS WERE SELECTED, THE AIRCRAFT 
ENTERED A HIGH SINK RATE AND LANDED HARD ON THE END OF THE RUNWAY. NO 
FURTHER PROBLEMS WERE NOTED DURING THE LANDING AND ROLL-OUT. THE 
PILOT EXAMINED THE AIRCRAFT AND DID NOT OBSERVE ANY DAMAGE. AFTER THE 
AIRCRAFT WAS FLOWN BACK TO HOUSTON, TX, A MORE COMPLETE INSPECTION 
REVEALED THAT A WING SPAR ASSEMBLY WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED.
