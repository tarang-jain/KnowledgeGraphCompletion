THE PILOT RECEIVED A WEATHER BRIEFING BEFORE TAKING OFF ON AN AERIAL 
TRAFFIC PATROL FOR A LOCAL RADIO STATION. HE WAS ISSUED A SPECIAL VFR 
CLEARANCE TO FOLLOW A PRE-ESTABLISHED ROUTE. HOWEVER, AFTER 
DEPARTING, HE ENCOUNTERED THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY. HE RETURNED TO THE 
DEPARTURE AIRPORT AND HOVERED UNTIL THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY 
SUBSIDED. AFTER ABOUT 30 MINUTES, THE PILOT DEPARTED AGAIN, BUT WAS 
UNABLE TO CONDUCT THE FLIGHT AS PLANNED. WITH THE WEATHER 
DETERIORATING, HE RECEIVED CLEARANCE TO ANOTHER AIRPORT. WHEN HE WAS 
ABOUT ONE MILE FROM THE AIRPORT, THE VISIBILITY WAS REPORT AS 1/2 MILE. HE 
REPORTED THAT WHEN HE WAS ABOUT 100 FEET AGL, HE TURNED NORTHEAST INTO 
THE WIND TO GET CLOSE TO THE BOUNDRY ROAD AND FENCE AND TO GET VISUAL 
REFERENCES. ALSO, HE STATED THAT THE VISIBILITY THROUGH THE BUBBLE WAS 
DISTORTED BY THE HEAVY DOWNPOUR AND BUBBLE FOG. WHILE ATTEMPTING A 
HOVER LANDING, HE TOUCHED DOWN, TAIL LOW, MOVING REARWARD. THE REAR 
PART OF THE SKIDS AND THE TAIL ROTOR HIT THE GROUND AND CONTROL WAS 
LOST.
