WHILE THE PILOT WAS LANDING WITH A RIGHT CROSSWIND CONDITION, THE 
AIRCRAFT DRIFTED OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY AND COLLIDED WITH A 
CONCRETE STAND PIPE. THIS RESULTED IN DAMAGE TO THE WING, WING STRUT 
AND PROPELLER. A GO-AROUND WAS ATTEMPTED, BUT THE DAMAGED PROPELLER 
FAILED TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT THRUST. THE AIRCRAFT CAME TO REST IN A 
FIELD.
