THE RIGHT MAIN GEAR "IN TRANSIT" LIGHT REMAINED ON AFTER GEAR 
RETRACTION ON A TRAINING FLIGHT. VARIOUS METHODS OF REMEDIAL ACTION 
DID NOT CURE THE PROBLEM. A LANDING ON RUNWAY 21 WAS EXECUTED WITH 
THE NOSE AND LEFT MAIN GEAR IN THE DOWN POSITION. THE RIGHT GEAR 
REMAINED IN TRANSIT. DIRECTIONAL CONTROL WAS MAINTAINED NEARLY 
THROUGHOUT THE LANDING ROLL. PRIOR TO THIS FLIGHT, COMPANY 
MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL HAD INSPECTED THE GEAR IN COMPLIANCE WITH A 
TELEGRAPHIC MESSAGE FROM THE MANUFACTURER. THE INSPECTION WAS 
INITIATED BY ONE MAINTENANCE SHIFT AND COMPLETED BY ANOTHER. 
INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION WAS PASSED BETWEEN THE SHIFTS TO ENSURE THAT 
GEAR DOOR WAS PROPERLY RE-RIGGED. DURING GEAR EXTENSION, THE DOOR 
JAMMED PREVENTING COMPLETE EXTENSION OF THE GEAR.
