APPROACH CONTROL AND REQUESTED VECTORS TO THE GWINNETT COUNTY ARPT AT 
LAWRENCEVILLE, GA. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE HAD BEEN GOING AROUND 
THUNDERSTORMS AND IT WAS TURNING DARK. SEVERAL MINUTES LATER THE PILOT 
ASKED HOW TO TURN ON THE RUNWAY LIGHTS AND STATED HE HAD THE ROTATING 
BEACON IN SIGHT. A CFI AT THE ARPT OBSERVED THE PLANE FLY OVER THE ARPT AT 
300 TO 400 FEET GENERALLY ALIGNED WITH RUNWAY 7. THE RUNWAY LIGHTS WERE OUT DUE 
TO THE MAIN CIRCUIT BREAKER BEING TRIPPED BY LIGHTNING. THE AIRCRAFT WAS 
THEN OBSERVED ENTERING A WINGS LEVEL, STEEP DESCENT WHICH CONTINUED 
UNTIL THE AIRCRAFT WAS OBSCURED FROM VIEW BY RAIN AND FOG. THE WRECKAGE WAS 
LOCATED ABOUT 1/4 MI EAST OF THE DEPARTURE END OF RUNWAY 7. THE FLAP 
ACTUATOR WAS IN THE MECHANICAL POSITION CORRESPONDING TO A 40 DEG FLAP 
SETTING.
