THE PILOT WAS FLYING TO MAINTAIN PROFICIENCY. HE HAD NOT FLOWN THIS 
MAKE AND MODEL WITHIN THE LAST 90 DAYS, BUT HE HAD FLOWN ANOTHER 
TAILWHEEL EQUIPPED AIRCRAFT ON 12/4/81.WHILE LANDING, HE TOUCHED DOWN 
WHILE CORRECTING FOR A CROSSWIND, BUT THEN BELIEVED THAT HE MAY HAVE 
HAD A LEFT QUARTERING TAILWIND. DURING THE LANDING ROLL, TWO GUSTS OF 
WIND WERE ENCOUNTERED WHICH RAISED THE LEFT WING. THE AIRCRAFT THEN 
VEERED LEFT AND THE RIGHT WING STRUCK THE RUNWAY. THE AIRCRAFT RAN OFF 
THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY, A GEAR BOLT FAILED, AND THE PROPELLER 
CONTACTED THE GROUND. THE WIND WAS GUSTING UP TO ABOUT 14 KNOTS.
