THE PILOT TOOK OFF WITH A MALFUNCTIONING FUEL QUANTITY GUAGE. BEFORE 
TAKEOFF, HE VISUALLY CHECKED THE FUEL AND ESTIMATED THAT THE TANK WAS 
ABOUT 1/2 FULL. AFTER RETURNING FROM A LOCAL FLIGHT, THE ENGINE LOST 
POWER DURING A TURN TO FINAL APPROACH FOR LANDING. UNABLE TO SAFELY 
LAND ON THE AIRPORT, THE PILOT LANDED IN A PLOWED FIELD. THE GEAR 
COLLAPSED AND THE AIRCRAFT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED. NO FUEL WAS 
FOUND IN THE FUEL TANK.
