THE PILOT STATED THAT HE WAS ON A ONE HOUR FLIGHT FOR AERIAL SURVEY TO 
GIDDINGS, TEXAS AND RETURN. THE RIGHT FUEL TANK RAN DRY AND HE 
SWITCHED TO THE LEFT TANK WHICH INDICATED NEARLY 1/4 FULL. 
APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES LATER, THE ENGINE STOPPED OPERATING. A FORCED 
LANDING WAS MADE IN A PASTURE. DURING THE LANDING, THE NOSE GEAR 
COLLAPSED WHEN RUTTED TERRAIN WAS ENCOUNTERED.
