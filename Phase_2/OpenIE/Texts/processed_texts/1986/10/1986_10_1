THE PILOT LANDED LONG AT A PRIVATE GRASS AIRSTRIP AND DELIBERATELY 
GROUND LOOPED THE AIRCRAFT TO AVOID OVERRUNNING THE AIRSTRIP INTO A 
THREE FOOT DITCH. THE NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED DURING THE GROUND LOOP AND 
THE WINGS AND MAIN GEARS WERE DAMAGED WHEN THE AIRCRAFT SLID 
SIDEWAYS ACROSS A DITCH AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY. THE PILOT REPORTED 
LITTLE BRAKING ACTION AS THE AIRSTRIP WAS WET FROM RECENT RAINS.
