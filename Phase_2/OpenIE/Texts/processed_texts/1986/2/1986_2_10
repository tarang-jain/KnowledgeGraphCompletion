THE PILOT STATED THAT A NORMAL APPROACH AND A 3 POINT LANDING WERE 
MADE AT THE RED LION AIRPORT. HOWEVER AFTER THE AIRCRAFT ROLLED FOR 2-3 
SECONDS, IT STARTED TO DRIFT TO THE RIGHT. LEFT RUDDER WAS APPLIED, BUT 
THERE WAS NO RESPONSE. THE PILOT THEN APPLIED FULL LEFT RUDDER AND 
BRAKES. THE AIRCRAFT SLOWED DOWN, BUT REPORTEDLY THERE WAS STILL NO 
RESPONSEFROM THE LEFT RUDDER. THE AIRCRAFT DEPARTED THE RUNWAY AT A 
45 DEGREE ANGLE, COLLIDED WITH A DIRT EMBANKMENT AND WAS DAMAGED. AN 
EXAM OF THE AIRCRAFT WAS MADE, BUT NO PRE-ACDNT MALFUCTION WAS FOUND.
