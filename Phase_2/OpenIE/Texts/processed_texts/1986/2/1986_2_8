ON FEBRUARY 1, 1986 AT ABOUT 1045 PST A GROB 103 GLIDER, N103BK, GROUND 
LOOPED IN MUD FOLLOWING AN ABORTED TAKEOFF AT SKY SAILING AIRPORT, 
FREEMONT CALIFORNIA. THE PILOT ELECTED TO ABORT THE TAKEOFF BECAUSE IT 
APPEARED THE TOW AIRCRAFT WAS NOT CLIMBING NORMALLY. THE TOW 
OPERATION WAS CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARD PROCEDURES 
WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE THE GLIDER PILOT TO COORDINATE WITH THE TOW 
AIRCRAFT PILOT PRIOR TO THE FLIGHT. AFTER THE GLIDER RELEASED, IT DROPPED 
18 INCHES TO THE GROUND, VEERED TO THE RIGHT AND COLLIDED WITH A DITCH.
