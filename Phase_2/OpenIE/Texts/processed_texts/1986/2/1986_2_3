THE PILOT WAS RELYING ON HIS LORAN C FOR NAVIGATION WHEN HE DECIDED TO 
ALTER HIS DESTINATION TO DELAWARE MUNICIPAL ARPT DUE TO ADVERSE WINDS 
AND TURBULENCE. HE HAD BEEN CHECKING HIS CHARTS FOR OBSTRUCTIONS 
WHEN THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH TREES IN A WOODED AREA SHORT OF HIS 
DESTINATION. THE PILOT HAD JUST DESCENDED TO 2200 FEET MSL TO AVOID 
TURBULENCE . HE STATED HE MAY HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT HIS CHARTS FOR UP TO 
FORTY SECONDS BUT THAT WAS NOT CUSTOMARY FOR HIM BECAUSE HIS AIRCRAFT 'HAS 
A TENDENCY TO ENTER A LEFT TURN EASY, HANDS OFF.'
