TAKEOFF, THE RIGHT ENG LOST POWER AND THE AIRCRAFT BEGAN TO DRIFT RIGHT, HE 
PULLED THE POWER OFF AND LANDED GEAR UP IN THE GRASS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF 
RUNWAY 08. POST CRASH EXAMINATION OF THE RIGHT ENG REVEALED THAT THE FUEL 
PRESSURE SWITCH SHORTED OUT CAUSING THE HIGH FUEL BOOST PUMP TO COME

AND FLOODING OUT THE ENG.
