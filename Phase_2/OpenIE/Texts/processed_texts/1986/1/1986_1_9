N101AA WAS OPERATING AS AMERICAN FLIGHT 192. FLIGHT 192 WAS ORIGINALLY CLEARED 
TO LAND ON RUNWAY 21R; HOWEVER, A PRECEEDING AIRCRAFT HAD A LANDING GEAR 
PROBLEM, SO FLIGHT 192 WAS CLEARED TO LAND ON RUNWAY 21C, INSTEAD. THE COPILOT, 
WHO WAS FLYING THE AIRCRAFT, MADE A SIDE-STEP MANEUVER TO LAND ON RUNWAY 21C. 
THE AIRCRAFEET TOUCHED DOWN LONG ON THE 8500 FEET RUNWAY. THE FLIGHT CREW RPRTD THAT 
'EVERYTHING SEEMED NORMAL DURING THE ROLLOUT UNTIL BELOW 80 KNOTS 
WHEN THE AIRCRAFT DID NOT SEEM TO SLOW.'  THE CREWMEMBERS WERE UNABLE 
TO STOP ON THE REMAINING RUNWAY DESPITE THE USE OF BRAKES AND REVERSE 
THRUST. INFO OBTAINED DURING THE INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT THE AIRCRAFT 
HAD TOUCHED DOWN WITH AN ESTIMATED 5037 FEET OF RUNWAY REMAINING. 
ACCORDING TO THE PERFORMANCE HANDBOOK, THE STOPPING DISTANCE ON AN 
ICY RUNWAY WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER 5100 FT.
