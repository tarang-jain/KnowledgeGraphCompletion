THE PILOT HAD BEEN USING AUTO GAS IN THIS AIRCRAFT, HOWEVER, HE EXPERIENCED 
WATER CONTAMINATION PROBLEMS AND DISCONTINUED ITS USE. HE THEN FOUND 
HIMSELF AT AN ARPT NEEDING FUEL. THE ARPT ONLY HAD AUTO GAS AVAILABLE SO 
THE PILOT REFUELED THE AIRCRAFT WITH AUTO GAS. WHILE MAKING A TOUCH AND GO AT 
BREWER ARPT HE EXPERIENCED A PARTIAL POWER LOSS ON CLIMBOUT AT 700-800 
FEET AGL. HE DECIDED TO LAND ON AN UNOPENED SECTION OF HIGHWAY. JUST 
PRIOR TO TOUCHDOWN HE NOTICED A SET OF POWER LINES IN HIS PATH. HE DOVE 
TO PASS UNDER THE POWER LINES AND STRUCK THE ROAD HARD ENOUGH TO 
BOUNCE BACK INTO THE AIR. HE THEN LOST CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT WHICH 
DESCENDED TO THE LEFT. THE AIRCRAFT FLIPPED OVER ON TOUCHDOWN.
