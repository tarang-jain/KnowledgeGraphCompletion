THE AIRCRAFT WAS IN CRUISE WHEN THE ENGINE STARTED SPUTTERING. 
ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, HE SWITCHED TANKS AND THE ENGINE WOULD START 
TO RUN THEN MISS, START TO RUN THEN-MISS, OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE PILOT 
STATED THAT WHILE THIS WAS HAPPENING HE WAS LOSING ALTITUDE AND WHEN 
HE COULDN'T GET 'FULL' POWER HE DECIDED TO MAKE A FORCED LANDING IN AN 
OPEN FIELD. POST ACCIDENT EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT WITH WINGS LEVEL 
NO FUEL COULD BE DRAINED FROM THE RIGHT INBOARD SUMP AND 
APPROXIMATELY TWO OUNCES FROM THE LEFT INBOARD SUMP.
