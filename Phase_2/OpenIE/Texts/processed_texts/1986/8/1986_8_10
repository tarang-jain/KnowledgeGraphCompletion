THE WEAK LINK AT THE TOW VEHICLE BROKE DURING LAUNCHING. THE PILOT 
LOWERED THE NOSE OF THE AIRCRAFT AND TURNED INTO THE WIND. THE PILOT STATED 
THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS STALLED AND THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO STOP THE DESCENT 
RATE. THE AIRCRAFT STRUCK THE RUNWAY IN A SLIGHT NOSE DOWN ATTITUDE. THE 
WEAK LINK ROPE WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR TESTING TO DETERMINE THE 
STRENGTH OF THE ROPE AND ANY DEFECTS. THE PILOT ASSUMED TOO HIGH OF A 
PITCH ANGLE TOO LOW TO THE GROUND DURING INITIAL CLIMB FOR THIS TYPE OF 
LAUNCH WITH THE TOW HOOK BEING FORWARD OF THE AIRCRAFT'S C.G. BEING 
APPROXIMATELY 150 FEET AGL WHEN THE STALL OCCURRED, THE PILOT WAS UNABLE 
TO FULLY RECOVER PRIOR TO CONTACTING THE RUNWAY.
