THE PILOT EXPERIENCED A COMPLETE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM FAILURE THAT WAS 
CAUSED BY A BROKEN WIRE AT AN ALTERNATOR TERMINAL. UPON EXTENSION OF 
THE HYDRAULICALLY OPERATED LANDING GEAR A SAFE GEAR DOWN INDICATION 
WAS NOT OBTAINED. ACTIVATION OF THE CO2 OPERATED EMERGENCY GEAR 
EXTENSION SYSTEM FAILED TO PROVIDE A SAFE GEAR DOWN INDICATION. THE 
PILOT WAS UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH ANY FACILITY TO DETERMINE THE 
POSITION OF THE LANDING GEAR BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF ELECTRICAL POWER. 
HE ELECTED TO LAND ON THE GRASS ADJACENT TO THE RUNWAY. THE GEAR WAS 
DOWN AND UPON TOUCHDOWN, THE NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED WHEN IT DUG INTO 
THE SOFT TERRAIN. THE AIRCRAFT THEN FLIPPED INVERTED.
