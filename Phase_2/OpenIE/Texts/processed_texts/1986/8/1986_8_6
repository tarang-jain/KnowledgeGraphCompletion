AFTER THE AIRCRAFT WAS INITALLY TAXIED FOR TAKEOFF, THE PILOT RETURNED 
TO THE RAMP AND STATED THAT HE WAS EXPERIENCING ENGINE PROBLEMS. HE 
INQUIRED AT AN FBO ABOUT CHARTERING AN AIRCRAFT TO TAKE HIMSELF AND HIS 
SON TO AN EXPERIMENTAL AIRCRAFT ASSOCIATION CONVENTION AT OSHKOSH, WI. 
MECHANICS LOOKED AT THE AIRCRAFT, BUT NO SPECIFIC PROBLEM WAS 
IDENTIFIED. THE AIRCRAFT THEN DEPARTED AND SMOKE WAS OBSERVED COMING 
FROM THE AIRCRAFT AS IT LOST POWER. THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO RETURN THE 
AIRPORT, HOWEVER, THE AIRCRAFT TOUCHED DOWN SHORT OF THE RUNWAY AND 
NOSED OVER IN A MARSH AREA.
