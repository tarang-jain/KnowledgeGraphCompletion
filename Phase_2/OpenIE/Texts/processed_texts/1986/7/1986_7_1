THE NON-INSTRUMENT RATED PILOT FILED AN IFR FLIGHT PLAN INTO KNOWN AND 
FORECAST IFR WEATHER. DURING HIS SECOND ILS APPROACH TO THE AIRPORT, 
AFTER THE CONTROL TOWER HAD CLOSED, HE FAILED TO UTILIZE THE AIRCRAFT 
RADIO TO ILLUMINATE THE APPROACH LIGHTING SYSTEM. THE PILOT FAILED TO 
LOCATE THE RUNWAY ENVIRONMENT IN SUFFICIENT TIME TO COMPLETE THE ILS 
LANDING. THEREAFTER, HE LOST CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT WHILE ATTEMPTING 
TO CIRCLE UNDERNEATH THE 300 FOOT CEILING ON THE DARK NIGHT AND THE 
AIRCRAFT CRASHED INTO TREES ON THE AIRPORT.
