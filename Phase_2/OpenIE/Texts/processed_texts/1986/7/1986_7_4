THE HELISTAT, A HYBRID A/C WITH 4 H-34 MAIN FUSELAGES ATTACHED TO A 
FRAME ALONG WITH A ZPG-2 HELIUM FILLED ENVELOPE HAD JUST COMPLETED IT 
FIRST HOVER TEST FLIGHT SUCCESSFULLY AND LANDED. A POWER LOSS WAS NOTED ON 
THE NO. 3 HELICOPTER AND THE TEST WAS TERMINATED AND THE MOORING MAST 
CALLED FOR. PRIOR TO RE-MOORING A WIND SHIFT CAUSED AN UNCOMMANDED 
LEFT TURN WHICH THE PILOT COULD NOT CONTROL WITH THE FLIGHT CONTROLS. 
WITH A TAILWIND, NO WHEEL BRAKES OR GND STEERING A TAKEOFF WAS 
ATTEMPTED. THE 4 MAIN LANDING GEAR WHICH HAD NO SHIMMY DAMPNERS 
STARTED TO SHIMMY. THE FOUR HELICOPTERS STARTED TO REACT TO THE SHIMMY 
WITH GROUND RESONANCE. AS THE HELISTAT FINALLY LIFTED OFF, THE FOUR 
INDIVIDUAL HELICOPTERS BROKE OFF AND FELL TO THE GROUND. ONE PILOT 
RECEIVED FATAL INJURIES, 3 RECEIVED SERIOUS INJURIES AND ONE MINOR 
INJURIES. THE HELISTAT WAS DESTROYED. THE PRW LOSS ON THE NO. 3 
HELICOPTER WAS TRACED TO A MISSING THROTTLE LINKAGE CORRELATION PIN. 
WHY THE PIN WAS MISSING WAS NOT DETERMINED.
