THE PILOT ATTEMPTED A NIGHT LANDING AFTER HE WAS UNABLE TO EXTEND THE 
AIRCRAFT'S LANDING LIGHTS. HE STATED THAT, OVER THE END OF THE RUNWAY AT ABOUT 
25 FEET AGL, EVERYTHING BLENDED INTO A LARGE BLACK SPOT. AS THE PILOT 
ATTEMPTED A GO-AROUND, THE AIRCRAFT CONTACTED THE RUNWAY, CAUSING THE LEFT 
MAIN GEAR TO COLLAPSE. THE AIRCRAFT THEN SLID DOWN THE RUNWAY AND OFF TO THE 
LEFT BEFORE COMING TO A STOP.
