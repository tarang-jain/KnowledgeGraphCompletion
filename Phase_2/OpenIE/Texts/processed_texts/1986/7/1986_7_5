THE PILOT INTENDED TO PRACTICE A SHORT FIELD LANDING AND EXTENDED FULL 
FLAPS. INITIALLY, HIS APPROACH WAS HIGHER AND FASTER THAN NORMAL. HOWEVER, 
BEFORE LANDING, A HIGH SINK RATE DEVELOPED. THE AIRCRAFT TOUCHED DOWN 
HARD, THE RIGHT WING DROPPED AND THE AIRCRAFT STARTED TO TURN RIGHT. THE PILOT 
MAINTAINED CONTROL AND CONTINUED FLIGHT OFF OF THE RUNWAY AND OVER A GRASS AREA, 
THEN THE AIRCRAFT SETTLED GENTLY ON A TAXIWAY. DURING THE SEQUENCE, THE 
RIGHT MAIN GEAR COLLAPSED AND 2 RUNWAY LIGHTS WERE DAMAGED. THE PILOT WAS NOT 
SURE WHETHER THE RIGHT MAIN GEAR HAD FAILED FROM THE HARD LANDING OR 
FROM HITTING A RUNWAY LIGHT. THE PILOT RPRTD THE WIND WAS FROM THE SW AT 15 
KTS, BUT THE UNICOM OPERATOR HAD RPRTD THE WIND WAS LIGHT AND VARIABLE.
