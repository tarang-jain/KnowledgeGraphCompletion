DURING THE TAKEOFF ROLL THE PILOT LOST CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT, THE 
AIRCRAFT EXITED THE RUNWAY AND ROLLED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE. THE INSPECTION 
OF BOTH TAILWHEEL AND TAILWHEEL ASSEMBLY REVEALED VERY LOOSE CABLES 
BETWEEN THE LOCKING HANDLE AND THE TAILWHEEL. AT THE TIME OF THE 
ACCIDENT THE PILOT HAD ONLY SIX HOURS IN THE TYPE OF AIRCRAFT.
