WITNESSES OBSERVED BLACK SMOKE TRAILING FROM THE AIRCRAFT SHORTLY 
AFTER LIFTOFF AND CONTINUE UNTIL GROUND IMPACT. THE PILOT INDICATED 
THAT HE FIRST NOTICED AN ENGINE ROUGHNESS ABOUT 100-200 FEET IN THE AIR 
AND THOUGHT IT WAS SIMILAR TO AN ENGINE THAT WAS RUNNING TO RICH. HE 
ELECTED NOT TO TRY AND ABORT THE TAKEOFF BUT TO TRY AND PERFORM A 
NORMAL TRAFFIC PATTERN AND COME AROUND AND LAND AGAIN. POWER 
CONTINUED TO DECREASE WITH THE RESULT BEING THAT HE WAS FORCED TO 
ATTEMPT TO LAND THE AIRCRAFT IN A NEARBY FIELD, COLLIDING WITH THE ONLY 
HOUSE LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF THE FIELD. EXAMINATION OF THE AIRCRAFT 
AND THE ENGINE DID NOT DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE REPORTED LOSS OF 
POWER.
