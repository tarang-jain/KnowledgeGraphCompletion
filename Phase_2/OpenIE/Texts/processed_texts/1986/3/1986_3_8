THE AIRCRAFT LANDED HARD FOLLOWING A SIMULATED SHORT FIELD LANDING OVER 
AN OBSTACLE. POWER WAS REDUCED AS THE AIRCRAFT CLEARED THE IMAGINARY 
OBSTACLE BUT THERE WAS A SLIGHT DELAY IN LOWERING THE NOSE TO MAINTAIN 
AIRSPEED. THE AIRCRAFT WAS FLARED AT A HIGH SINK RATE WITHOUT POWER AND WAS 
SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED.
