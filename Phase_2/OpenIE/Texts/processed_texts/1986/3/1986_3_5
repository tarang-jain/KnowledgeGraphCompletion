THE AIRCRAFT WAS APPROXIMATELY 180 LBS OVER MAX RECOMMENDED TAKEOFF 
GROSS WEIGHT AND USED ALMOST ALL OF A 3560 FOOT RUNWAY TO TAKE OFF. THE 
PILOT STATED THAT AFTER LIFTOFF THE AIRCRAFT WOULD NOT TURN LEFT AND 
BEGAN TO TURN RIGHT ON ITS OWN. HE CLIMBED TO APPROX 150 FEET AND BEGAN 
TO SETTLE BACK TOWARD THE GROUND IN THIS CONTINUOUS RIGHT TURN. HE 
THEN STRUCK A UTILITY POLE THEN THE GROUND. AN ENGINE TEARDOWN 
REVEALED NOTHING THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED AN INFLIGHT ENGINE PROBLEM. 
THE PILOT WAS FLYING ON AN EXPIRED MEDICAL CERTIFICATION AND DID NOT 
HAVE A BIENNIAL FLIGHT REVIEW WITHIN THE LAST 24 MONTHS. IN ADDITION, THE 
AIRCRAFT HAD NOT HAD AN ANNUAL INSPECTION SINCE 1981.
