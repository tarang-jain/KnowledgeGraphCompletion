WITNESSES OBSERVED 2 AIRCRAFT FLYING NEAR TREETOP LEVEL AND REPORTED 
THAT ONE APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 10 FEET BEHIND THE OTHER. THE LEAD 
AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH TREES WHEN THE PILOT DELAYED HIS PULLUP TO A 
POINT WHERE HE WAS UNABLE TO CLIMB OVER A RIDGE ON HIS ROUTE OF FLIGHT. 
BOTH AIRCRAFT WERE BEING FLOWN BY FOREIGN PILOTS ENROLLED IN THE 
OPERATOR'S PART 141 FLIGHT SCHOOL.
