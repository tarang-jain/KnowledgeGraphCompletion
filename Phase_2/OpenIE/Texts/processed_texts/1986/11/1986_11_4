AIRCRAFT EXPERIENCED A POWER LOSS IMMEDIATELY AFTER TAKEOFF FROM AN 
OFFSHORE PLATFORM IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE PILOT HELD COLLECTIVE TO 
CLEAR THE RIG AND THEN POPPED THE FLOATS AND AUTOROTATED TO THE 
WATER. THE AUTO WAS SUCCESSFUL, HOWEVER, THE AIRCRAFT WAS STRUCK BY A 5' 
WAVE AND ROLLED OVER. BOTH OCCUPANTS EGRESSED WITHOUT PROBLEM AND 
THE PAX SWAM TO THE RIG. THE PILOT INFLATED HIS LIFE VEST AND WAS SWEPT 
AWAY BY THE CURRENT AND SWAM ASHORE 14 HOURS LATER. INVESTIGATION 
REVEALED THAT THE COMPRESSOR DISCHARGE PRESSURE (PC) LINE WAS 
DISCONNECTED FROM THE BACK OF THE ENG FUEL CONTROL. A LEAK OR 
SEPARATION OF THE PC LINE WOULD CAUSE THE FUEL SCHEDULE TO REDUCE ENG 
SPEED TO BELOW FLIGHT IDLE. NO RECENT MAINTENANCE HAD BEEN PERFORMED ON 
THE FUEL CONTROL OR THE LINE.
