NUMEROUS WITNESSES ON A SANDBAR IN THE WHITE RIVER OBSERVED THIS 
COLLISION OF TWO AIRPLANES AS THEY WERE FLYING CLOSE TOGETHER, LOW, 
OVER THE RIVER. OF THE NINE WITNESS STATEMENTS RECEIVED, FIVE HAD THE 
PIPER PA-28-140 HITTING THE CESSNA 140, THREE HAD THE CESSNA 140 HITTING 
THE PIPER PA-28-140 AND ONE HAD THEM DRIFTING TOGETHER. THE PEOPLE IN 
THE AIRPLANES WERE WAVING TO THE PEOPLE ON THE SANDBAR WHEN THE 
AIRPLANES COLLIDED. BOTH AIRPLANES IMPACTED THE TERRAIN ABOVE THE 
RIVER BANK. THE PIPER PA-28-140 BURNED AFTER IMPACT WITH THE TERRAIN.
