THE AIRCRAFT WAS FLYING AT LOW ALT IN THE VICINITY OF INTERSTATE I-95 WHEN THE 
PILOT MADE A 360 DEG, RGT TURN. AFTER THE TURN, THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH POWER 
LINES, WHICH CROSSED I-95, THEN CRASHED AND BURNED. A WITNESS ESTIMATED 
THE AIRCRAFEET HAD DSCNDD TO ABOUT 35 TO 50 FEET AGL BFR HITTING THE POWER LINES. AN 
EXAM OF THE AIRCRAFT AND ENG REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF A PREIMPACTMECHANICAL 
PROBLEM. THE PILOT WAS FLYING THE AIRCRAFT FROM THE RGT SEAT. THE OUTBOARD 
(MALE) PORTION OF THE RGT SEAT BELT WAS FND CONNECTED TO THE INBOARD 
(FEMALE) PORTION OF THE LEFT SEAT BELT. LIKEWISE, THE OUTBOARD (MALE) 
PORTION OF THE LEFT SEAT BELT WAS FND CONNECTED TO THE INBOARD (FEMALE) 
PORTION OF THE RGT SEAT BELT; HOWEVER, THE INBOARD PORTION OF THE RGT 
SEAT BELT WAS NOT ANCHORED TO THE AIRFRAME. THE PASSENGERS (PAX) IN THE 
LEFT FRONT AND LEFT REAR SEATS WERE FATALLY INJURED. A POSTMORTEM EXAM 
OF THE FATAL PAX FAILED TO DISCLOSE INJURIES COMMENSURATE WITH THE USE 
OF RESTRAINT SYSTEMS. A TOXICOLOGY CHECK SHOWED THE PILOT HAD A 
BLOOD/ALCOHOL LVL OF 0.155%.
