THE PILOT INITIATED A MAXIMUM POWER TAKEOFF FROM A CONFINED PARKING LOT 
WITH 2 PASSENGERS ON BOARD. THE AREA WAS BOARDERED BY OBSTRUCTIONS AND 
PEOPLE. THE PILOT RPRTD THAT DURING LIFT-OFF, SHE INCREASED POWER TO 2900 
RPM, LIFTED OFF TO A 4' HOVER WITH 33' OF MANIFOLD PRESSURE, THEN BEGAN A 
MAX PERFORMANCE TAKEOFF, 'PULLING POWER AND TURNING THROTTLE' FOR 
EXTRA RPM WITH SLOW FORWARD SPEED, REACHING 36' OF MANIFOLD PRESSURE. 
AT APPROXIMATELY 15' AGL, THE PILOT NOTED A DECREASE IN RPM. SHE INCREASED THROTTLE 
APPLICATION, THEN DECREASED THE COLLECTIVE, BUT WAS UNABLE TO RECOVER 
THE LOSS OF RPM. SHE MADE A LEFT PEDAL TURN TO AVOID OBSTRUCTIONS AND 
PEOPLE. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE HELICOPTER TOUCHED DOWN HARD AND WAS 
DAMAGED. AN EXAM OF THE ENG DID NOT REVEAL ANY DEFECTS. THE FLIGHT MANUAL 
WARNED THAT LOSS OF ROTOR AND ENG RPM WOULD FOLLOW WHEN THE ENG WAS 
OVERBOOSTED. AT 36.5' OF MANIFOLD PRESSURE, THE POP-OFF VALVE WOULD 
HAVE ACTIVATED WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A SLIGHT POWER LOSS.
