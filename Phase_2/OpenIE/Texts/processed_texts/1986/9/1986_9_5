WHILE APCHG TO LAND, THE REGISTERED ULTRALIGHT AIRCRAFT ENCOUNTERED A 
DOWNDRAFT WHICH EXCEEDED ITS CLIMB PERFORMANCE. THE AIRCRAFT WAS HEADED 
TWD POWER LINES, SO THE PILOT ELECTED TO FLY UNDER THE LINES. AS THE 
ULTRALIGHT WAS CROSSING UNDER THE POWER LINES, ONE OF ITS VERTICAL FINS 
HIT THE BOTTOM CABLE WHICH DISABLED THE AIRCRAFT'S LEFT RUDDER CONTROL. 
THE AIRCRAFT TURNED TO THE RGT TWD A HILL AND WOULD NOT CLIMB SUFFICIENTLY TO 
CLEAR OVER TREES. THE PILOT INTENTIONALLY ALLOWED THE AIRCRAFT TO MUSH INTO 
THE TREES WHILE HE STILL HAD CONTROL.
