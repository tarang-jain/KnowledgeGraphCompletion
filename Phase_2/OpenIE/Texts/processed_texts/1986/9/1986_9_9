DURING A LANDING, THE AIRCRAFT ENCOUNTERED TURBULENCE, SO THE PILOT INITIATED 
A GO-AROUND. HOWEVER, THE AIRCRAFT WOULD NOT CLIMB, EVEN WITH FULL POWER. 
THE FLIGHT PATH WAS TOWARD POWER LINES AND A ROAD, SO THE PILOT ELECTED TO 
LAND IN A GRASS AREA. DURING THE LANDING, THE AIRCRAFT STRUCK A FENCE AND 
NOSED OVER. THE PILOT OF N44WR AND ANOTHER PILOT REPORTED THAT THE WIND 
VELOCITY AND DIRECTION WERE CHANGING RAPIDLY DUE TO THUNDERSTORM 
ACTIVITY NEAR THE ARPT.
