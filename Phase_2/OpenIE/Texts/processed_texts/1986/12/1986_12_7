THE STUDENT PILOT WAS CLEARED TO MAKE A TOUCH-AND-GO LANDING ON RUNWAY 21. AS 
HE WAS LNDG, HE NOTICED THE ARRESTING BARRIER (CABLE) WAS RAISED. HE 
ADDED FULL POWER AND PULLED BACK ON THE YOKE TO AVOID HITTING THE CABLE. 
THE AIRCRAFT LIFTED OFF, BUT ITS TAIL HIT THE CABLE. AT THAT TIME, THE PILOT WAS 
UNAWARE OF ANY DAMAGE, SO HE CONTINUED FLYING (MADE A GO-AROUND). HE 
ADVISED TOWER PSNL THAT THE BARRIER CABLE WAS UP AND THEY LOWERED THE 
CABLE. AFTER LANDING, AN INSPN REVEALED THE TAIL TIE-DOWN WAS MISSING AND 
THE REAR BULKHEAD WAS PARTIALLY RIPPED OUT AND BENT AGAINST THE RUDDER. 
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL HANDBOOK REQUIRED TOWER PERSONNEL TO KEEP THE ARRESTING GEAR IN 
THE RETRACTED OR DOWN POSITION FOR NORMAL OPERATION.
