THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO EXTEND THE LANDING GEAR IN PREPARATION FOR 
LANDING. TROUBLESHOOTING AND SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO EXTEND THE GEAR 
FAILED. THE PILOT THEN MADE A 360 DEGREE TURN OVER THE AIRPORT TO LOSE 
ALTITUDE DURING WHICH, HE SECURED THE ENGINE AND STOPPED THE 
PROPELLER IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION TO MINIMIZE DAMAGE. THE PILOT 
REALIZED AFTER 270 DEGREES OF TURN THAT INSUFFICIENT ALTITUDE REMAINED 
TO REACH THE RUNWAY. THE AIRCRAFT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY LANDED ON ROUGH 
TERRAIN SHORT OF RUNWAY 30. POST ACCIDENT INSPECTION REVEALED THE NOSE

GEAR TIRE WAS FOUND TO BE INFLATED TO 40 PSI. THE MAINTENANCE MANUAL
