THE PILOT TOOK OFF FROM A DECOMMISSIONED, UNLIGHTED ARPT AT NIGHT AFTER 
TELLING FRIENDS IN A BAR THAT HE WAS GOING TO NEW ORLEANS. LATER, 
WITNESSES OBSERVED THE AIRCRAFT AS THE PILOT MADE SEVERAL LOW PASSES OVER AN 
INTERSTATE HIGHWAY NEAR THE DEPARTURE ARPT. WHILE MANEUVERING (AS IF 
TO LAND), THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH POWER LINES THAT WERE CROSSING THE 
ROAD, THEN THE PLANE CRASHED TO THE GROUND AND BURNED. NO PREIMPACT 
PART FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION WAS EVIDENT. A CHECK OF THE PILOT'S BLOOD 
SHOWED AN ALCOHOL LVL OF 0.261%.
