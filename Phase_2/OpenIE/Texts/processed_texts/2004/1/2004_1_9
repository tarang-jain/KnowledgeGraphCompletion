The pilot started the takeoff roll. Just before rotation, the seat slid backwards. The pilot lost 
directional control of the airplane, and the airplane collided with an embankment. 
Examination of the seat tracks revealed no elongation of the seat track holes. The Before 
Starting The Engine checklist states, "Seats and Seat belts-Adjust and lock."
The pilot's failure to follow the checklist, resulting in a loss of directional control on the takeoff 
roll when the seat moved rearward, and on ground collision with an embankment.
On January 3, 2004, at 1333 eastern standard time, a Cessna 182G, N3102S, registered to a 
private owner, operating as a 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight, collided with an embankment on 
takeoff roll at Taylorsville Airport, Taylorsville, North Carolina. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The airplane sustained substantial damage. 
The private pilot reported minor injuries. The flight originated from Teague-Grider Airport, 
Taylorsville, North Carolina, on January 3, 2003, at 1333.
The pilot stated he started his takeoff roll on the west runway, and just before rotation his seat 
slid backwards. The pilot reported that he "lost directional control" of the airplane, and the 
airplane subsequently collided with an embankment.
Examination of the front seats revealed both seat track rails were buckled. The seat track pin 
holes were measured at 0.28 inches longitudinal and sideways dimensions.  Air Worthiness 
Directive 87-20-03R2, Seat Tracks,  requires inspection of all pin holes at 100 hour intervals. 
Replacement of the seat rail becomes mandatory once any dimension exceed 0.42.  No 
elongation of the seat track pin holes were noted.
Review of the Cessna 182 Pilot Operating Handbook, Section I, states in the BEFORE 
STARTING THE ENGINE checklist,
"(1) Seats and Seat Belts-Adjust and lock."
