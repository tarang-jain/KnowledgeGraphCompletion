Following a catastrophic engine failure in cruise, the airplane collided with multiple ground 
obstacles during a forced landing in a field.  The pilot reported that while in cruise flight he 
first noticed a "burning smell," which was followed a short time later by a low oil pressure 
indication.  The pilot then felt a vibration, followed by a brief engine overspeed to 3,000 rpm, 
and then the engine lost all power.  He performed a forced landing in a field and collided with 
multiple ground obstacles.   Post accident examination of the engine at the accident site 
revealed that the No. 6 connecting rod had penetrated the engine crank case.  An excess of 
engine oil was found on the bottom of the airplane.  Further examination revealed an oil filter 
gasket, Lycoming part number LW-13388, was extruded at the base of the filter assembly and 
had allowed virtually all engine oil to escape.  A Lycoming Mandatory Service Bulletin MSB-
543, and an emergency Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2000-18-53, that was later superceded by 
AD 2002-12-17, was applicable to this potential problem, and required repetitive inspections 
and gasket replacement or replacement of the gasket adapter plate with a different part 
number.  The investigation could find no evidence of compliance with either AD.
engine oil exhaustion due to the extrusion of an oil filter converter plate gasket and the failure 
of the aircraft owner to comply with a mandatory Service Bulletin and a Federal Aviation 
Administration emergency Airworthiness Directive.
On January 1, 2004, at 0920 Pacific standard time, a Piper PA-32R-300, N589Q, lost engine 
power and force landed in a field at Riverside, California.  The airplane was operated by the 
pilot under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91.  The private pilot and three passengers were not 
injured, and the airplane was substantially damaged.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.  The flight originated at Oceanside, California, at 
0850, and was destined for Big Bear, California.  
The pilot reported that while in cruise flight he first noticed a "burning smell," which was 
followed a short time later by a low oil pressure indication.  The pilot then felt a vibration, 
followed by a brief engine overspeed to 3,000 rpm, and then lost engine power.  He performed 
a forced landing in a field 1/2 mile northeast of March ARB and collided with multiple ground 
obstacles.
Post accident examination of the engine by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector 
at the accident site revealed that the No. 6 connecting rod had penetrated the engine crank 
case.  An excess of engine oil was found on the bottom of the airplane.  Further examination 
revealed an oil filter gasket, Lycoming part number LW-13388 was extruded at the base of the 
filter assembly.  The engine accessory case and the firewall was oil soaked.  
On September 5, 2000, the FAA issued emergency Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2000-18-53, 
which was applicable to Lycoming IO-540-K1G5D engines.  That AD was prompted by reports 
of certain oil filter converter plate gaskets, P/N LW-13388, extruding from the seat of the oil 
filter converter plate.  The protruding or swelling of the gasket allowed oil to leak from between 
the plate and accessory housing.  According to the text of the AD, it was intended to prevent 
complete loss of engine oil and subsequent seizing of the engine and possible fire, caused by oil 
leakage between the converter plate and accessory housing.   
The AD required the following: 
1.  For engines with more than 50 hours time-since-new (TSN), time-since-overhaul (TSO), or 
time-since-last replacement of the oil filter plate gasket, replacement of the oil filter converter 
plate gasket part number (P/N) LW-13388, or the converter plate kit P/N LW-13904. 
2. For engines with fewer than 50 hours TSN, TSO, or time-since-last replacement of the oil 
filter converter plate gasket P/N LW-13388, or the converter plate kit P/N LW-13904, 
inspection of the oil filter base for signs of oil leakage and evidence of gasket extrusion. 
3. Replacement of converter plate gasket P/N LW-13388 at intervals not to exceed 50 hours 
TIS since the last replacement of the gasket.  The actions are required to be done in accordance 
with Textron Lycoming Mandatory Service Bulletin (MSB) 543A, dated August 30, 2000, and 
Textron Lycoming Service Instruction number 1453, dated May 9, 1991. 
After emergency AD 2000-18-53 was issued, Textron Lycoming has issued a service bulletin 
supplement that relieves the requirements of MSB 543A and that eliminates the need for 
gasket replacement every 50 hours TSN, TSO, or time since the last replacement.   
AD 2002-12-17, which supercedes AD 2000-18-53, was then issued by the FAA and required 
the following actions:
1.  Before further flight after the effective date of the AD, for engines with more than 50 hours 
TSN or TSO, or time-since-last replacement of the oil filter plate gasket P/N LW-13388, 
replacement of the oil filter converter plate gasket or the converter plate kit P/N LW-13904. 
2.  Within 10 hours TIS or within 3 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs 
earlier, for engines with fewer than 50 hours TSN, TSO, or time-since-last replacement of the 
oil filter converter plate gasket P/N LW-13388, or the converter plate kit P/N LW-13904, 
inspection of the oil filter base for signs of oil leakage and evidence of gasket extrusion. 
3. Replacement of the converter plate gasket P/N LW-13388 at intervals not to exceed 50 hours 
TIS since the last replacement of the gasket. 
4. As terminating action to the repetitive gasket replacement specified in this AD, replacement 
of the oil filter converter plate gasket or the oil filter converter plate with a converter plate kit, 
in accordance with Part II and Part III of Textron Lycoming Supplement 1 to MSB 543A, dated 
October 4, 2000. 
The investigation could find no evidence that either of the AD's were complied with.
