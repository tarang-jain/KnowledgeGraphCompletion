During the takeoff and initial climb, the engine power was 100 rpm lower than expected, and 
the oil pressure decreased to 0.  The pilot initiated a left turn for a precautionary landing at the 
airport.  The engine continued to lose power during the approach, but it did not experience a 
total loss of power.  The airplane was not aligned with the centerline as it touched down on a 
runway, and traveled off the left side.  Examination of the airplane revealed that the pilot had 
recently installed a homemade oil cooler adapter on the certificated engine.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during a precautionary landing.  A factor was 
the pilot's unapproved maintenance modification resulting in the loss of oil pressure and 
partial loss of engine power.
