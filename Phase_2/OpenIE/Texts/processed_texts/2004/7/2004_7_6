According to the pilot,  the airplane collided with the top wire of a transmission tower that "was 
not visible to [him]." He stated that the airplane spun around 180 degrees to the left, the 
airplane "was out of control," collided with the ground, and came to rest inverted in a nearby 
field.  Examination of the wreckage site revealed the wreckage debris path extended across the 
field a distance of 75 feet leading up to the main wreckage site.  The tower arm of the 
transmission tower, that was estimated to be 100 feet high, was bent, and the upper 
transmission wire was separated. Examination of the wreckage revealed that the engine 
assembly separated from the engine mounts. The propeller hub was separated from the 
crankshaft.  The engine cowling and fuselage were crushed aft to the pilot compartment. The 
right wingtip was separated. The leading edge of the right wing was crushed beginning about 
midspan outboard to the end of the wing. The left wing was partially separated at the root and 
completely separated approximately midspan. The left horizontal stabilizer leading edge was 
crushed aft.  
The pilot's inadequate visual lookout and failure to maintain adequate obstacle clearance, 
which resulted in collision with transmission wires.
