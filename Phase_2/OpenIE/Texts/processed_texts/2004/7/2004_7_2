The airplane impacted terrain when the right main landing gear collapsed upon landing 
touchdown.  Examination of the right landing gear revealed that the brace assembly - right 
hand side, part number 5041000-46, was fractured.  The fracture surface displayed multiple 
initiations at the edge of the slot and an oxidized area with a distinct terminus, features 
consistent with fatigue.
