The airplane collided with terrain during the takeoff initial climb.  Prior to departure, the 
certified flight instructor (CFI) noted calm wind conditions.  During the initial climb, about 50 
to 75 feet above ground level, the airplane began to descend, while rolling and yawing to the 
right.  The CFI could not maintain control of the airplane, and it continued in a 300-foot-per-
minute descent.  The airplane impacted the ground and a fire erupted.  After egressing the 
airplane, the CFI noticed a strong shift in winds into tailwind conditions.  A few minutes later, 
he noted that the winds became light again, followed by periodic gusts and wind shifts.  The 
CFI reported that the airplane had no mechanical failures or malfunctions during the flight.  
The CFI reported that the airplane's gross weight was about 2,341 pounds, and the published 
maximum gross weight is 2,350 pounds.
the certified flight instructor's failure to maintain an adequate airspeed, which resulted in a 
stall/mush condition and a collision with terrain.  Factors in the accident were strong tailwind 
conditions and a sudden wind shift.
