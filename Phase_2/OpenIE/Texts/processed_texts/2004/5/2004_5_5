The airplane experienced a hard landing and veered off the runway.  The pilot began a 
standard stabilized approach and intended to level off about 10 feet above ground level, in an 
effort to let the airspeed gradually slow down.  The airplane continued in a descent faster than 
the pilot anticipated, and the airplane hit the runway surface hard.  The airplane bounced back 
into the air and porpoised down the runway, veering to the right.  The airplane continued off of 
the runway into a dirt area and impacted a taxiway sign.  The pilot reported no preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane.
the pilot's inadequate flare, which resulted in a hard landing.  Also causal was the pilot's 
inadequate recovery from a bounced landing, which resulted in an inadvertent porpoise and 
collision with a sign.
