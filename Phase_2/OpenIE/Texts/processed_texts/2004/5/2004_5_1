The airplane collided with a guy wire while in low altitude cruise near Philadelphia, 
Mississippi.  The pilot had just passed over Philadelphia Municipal Airport and turned left to a 
heading of 140 degrees, cruising at an altitude of 1600 feet. The pilot stated that at the reduced 
power setting of 2000 RPM, the airplane had a slightly higher angle of attack than normal 
cruise.  After about 8 minutes on the heading of 140 degrees, the pilot felt a shock on the 
airframe and heard a loud noise.  The airplane turned 30 degrees to the left.  The airplane was 
still flyable so the pilot proceeded to the nearest airport, Barrett Field in Philadelphia, 
Mississippi and landed without incident.  The pilot did not report any mechanical malfunctions 
with the airplane.  Examination of the airplane revealed that both left wings were broken off 
from the middle portion of wing, left wing spar damaged and the left aileron almost completely 
detached.  The pilot stated that "aircraft with characteristics of tandem seating with Pilot-In-
Command in the rear, and forward visibility obscured to any degree above the level flight path 
should not be flown for long periods on a steady heading.  Small course changes, left and right 
will eliminate the obscured area."
The pilot's failure to see and avoid a guy wire which resulted in an in-flight collision.
