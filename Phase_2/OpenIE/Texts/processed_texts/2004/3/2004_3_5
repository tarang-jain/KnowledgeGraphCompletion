The pilot stated that an earlier flight had occurred, and that fuel had been ordered, but it was 
not delivered and placed in the airplane's fuel tanks. He further stated that the refueling error 
was not detected during the preflight inspection. He said they departed from the Fort 
Lauderdale Executive Airport, and flew to the practice area to perform aerobatics, and as he 
rolled the airplane inverted, the engine hesitated. He said he immediately recognized that the 
airplane had not been refueled after the previous flight. Rather than fly over populated areas, 
the pilot said he elected to make a precautionary landing on a dirt road close to the practice 
area, and during the rollout the airplane veered to the left, off the dirt road and nosed over into 
a water filled canal, incurring damage.
The pilot's inadequate preflight planning which resulted in an off-airport precautionary 
landing to preclude fuel exhaustion, which resulted in damage to the airplane during the 
landing.
