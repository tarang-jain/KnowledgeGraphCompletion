During landing on runway 18 at an uncontrolled airfield, a Cessna 140 collided with an 
amateur built Rose Parakeet A-1 biplane that landed on runway 36 and was taxiing to the end 
of the runway.  Four other airplanes involved in the fly-in had previously landed on runway 36 
prior to the collision.
The pilot's failure to maintain visual lookout for other aircraft while landing.
On August 1, 2004, at 0845 central daylight time, a Cessna 140 single-engine high wing 
airplane, N2632N, and an amateur-built Rose Parakeet A-1 single-engine biplane, N14843, 
sustained substantial damage following a ground collision while landing in opposite directions 
at Lake Texoma State Park Airport (F31), near Kingston, Texas.  The Cessna 140 was registered 
to Ray's Used Equipment of Nocona, Texas, and operated by the pilot.  The Rose Parakeet A-1 
was registered to and operated by the pilot. Neither of the two private pilots were injured.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and flight plans were not filed for either flight.  
Both airplanes were operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as personal flights. 
The cross-country flights for both airplanes originated from Fairview Airport (7TS0), near 
Rhome, Texas, at 0750.
The 4,032-hour pilot of the Parakeet A-1biplane reported in the Pilot/Operator Aircraft 
Accident Report (NTSB Form 6120.1/2) that prior to landing on runway 36, he observed four 
other airplanes using runway 36 as the active runway.  The pilot further stated that after 
landing on runway 36, he taxied down the remaining 500 feet of the runway to exit at the 
parking area adjacent to the departure end of runway 36, as he was looking out of both sides of 
the cockpit.  When approximately 300 feet from the departure end of the runway, "an 
explosion from the right wing occurred."  The pilot stated his airplane rotated to the right, as 
he noticed a yellow airplane on the grass adjacent to the runway facing south.  
The 3,600-hour pilot of the Cessna 140 failed to complete and return an NTSB Form 6120.1/2, 
as he was requested.  
A witness, interviewed by an Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, who responded 
to the site of the accident, reported that the Parakeet A-1 biplane landed on runway 36 and was 
taxiing on the runway centerline to the parking area while the Cessna 140 was approaching to 
land on runway 18.  The witness also stated that the bright yellow Cessna 140 was slightly off 
the ground when the two airplanes collided.  
The Lake Texoma State Park Airport (F31) features a single (18/36) asphalt runway, 3,000 feet 
long by 50 feet wide.  The airfield is uncontrolled (non-towered) and operates under class G 
airspace.  The common traffic advisory frequency is 122.8 megahertz.  
Examination of the Cessna 140 by the FAA inspector revealed that the right wing spar was bent 
and the leading edge was structurally damaged.  The right aileron was severed.  Examination of 
Parakeet A-1 biplane revealed that the upper and lower right wings sustained damage and were 
separated from the fuselage.
