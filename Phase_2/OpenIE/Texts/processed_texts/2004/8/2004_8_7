The pilot said that he was getting his tail wheel endorsement and 15 hours flight time (with an 
instructor) for aircraft insurance purposes.  He said that he had landed the airplane, and 
during the rollout, the airplane swerved.  He said that he applied the brakes too hard, and the 
airplane nosed over on the runway.  The left wing strut was bent, and the vertical stabilizer was 
bent and wrinkled.
The failure of the private pilot receiving flight training for a tail wheel endorsement to maintain 
aircraft control, and his excessive braking during the landing roll, subsequently nosing over the 
airplane.  A contributing factor was the flight instructor's inadequate supervision of the trainee.
