The pilot declared a "mayday" 17 miles northeast of Columbia Metropolitan Airport, at 4,500 
feet and stated that his engine had lost power and that he was going to land in a parking lot.  
The airplane collided with power lines and the ground.  The post-accident examination of the 
fuel system revealed no fuel in either wing fuel tank, trace amounts of fuel in the fuel strainer, 
and trace amounts of fuel in the fuel line from the fuel strainer to the carburetor.   A functional 
check of the engine was accomplished and it produced power at idle and 1000 RPM.  The 
airplane was last topped off with fuel on October 31, 2004, and had flown 4.1 hours since that 
refueling. On the same day of the accident the pilot also completed a total of three takeoffs on 
the same fuel load. At 75 % engine power, the airplane has an endurance of 3.9 hours.
The pilot's inadequate preflight planning of fuel required for the flight, which resulted in fuel 
exhaustion and subsequent loss of engine power.
