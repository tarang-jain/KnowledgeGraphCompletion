The pilot was practicing touch-and-go landings in crosswind conditions, and during his first 
landing there was a 40 degree crosswind at five knots. As he was cleared for his second landing, 
the tower advised him that the wind had changed direction and speed, and he was therefore 
landing in a 60 degree crosswind of seven knots. During his second landing, he relaxed his 
"cross control input" too much during the landing flare, and the aircraft's left wing began to lift. 
He therefore elected to execute a go-around, but as he added power the aircraft began rotating 
to the left. He therefore elected to try to put the aircraft back onto the runway, but as it touched 
down, the aircraft was not aligned with the runway, and it therefore quickly veered to the left. 
As the aircraft departed the side of the runway, the tip of its right wing came in contact with the 
terrain resulting in substantial damage to the wings internal structure. According to the pilot, 
there was nothing wrong with the aircraft, and the accident was simply a result of his failure to 
adequately control the aircraft in the crosswind conditions.
The pilot's inadequate compensation for crosswind conditions during landing, resulting in his 
failure to maintain directional control. Factors include the presence of crosswinds.
