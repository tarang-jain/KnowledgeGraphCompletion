The pilot stated that he was not aware of the wet runway condition on the grass/sod runway 
surface prior to arriving at his destination airport. The pilot further stated that the active 
runway was orientated on a 020-degree magnetic heading, and the grass/sod surface was 
about 3000 feet long and 200 feet wide. The pilot also said, because of the 150-foot tall trees on 
the approach end of the runway, he established a steeper approach angle and faster approach 
speed than the normal profile for touchdown. According to the pilot the airplane touched down 
about 500 feet beyond the approach end of the runway. After landing the pilot recalled that 
airplane braking was not effective, and stated that the airplane began to "hydroplane", and he 
was not able to stop the airplane. The airplane continued off the departure end of the sod 
runway collided with a fence, and came to rest on Brunswick Highway in Waycross. No 
mechanical problems with the airplane were reported by the pilot,  
The pilot misjudged the approach speed to touchdown, and the hydroplaning of the airplane 
during the landing roll resulted in the overrun of the runway surface and the subsequent 
collision with a fence. .
