While maneuvering to locate the runway during a dark, nighttime flight, the airplane 
descended until colliding with trees.  As the pilot approached his home base airport, he 
attempted to activate the pilot controlled runway lights.  However, he was unsuccessful.  
Thereafter, the pilot performed a low altitude pass over what he believed was runway 16/34 to 
ascertain if a portion of the runway's lights were operating.  During the maneuver, the pilot 
failed to detect that the airplane was not aligned with the runway.  Also, the pilot failed to 
maintain adequate altitude to avoid colliding with trees 1/8-mile west of the airport.  Neither 
prior to taking off, nor at any time during the accident flight, did the pilot become aware that a 
Notice to Airman had been issued indicating that the airport's runway lights were "out of 
service."
the pilot's inadvertent descent and controlled flight into obstacles while maneuvering to land.  
Contributing factors were the dark, nighttime condition, which impaired the pilot's visual 
perceptions, and the pilot's failure to obtain a pertinent Notice to Airman regarding inoperative 
runway lights.
