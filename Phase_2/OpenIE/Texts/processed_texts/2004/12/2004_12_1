The airplane impacted a muddy field during a forced landing due to a total loss of engine power 
about 1 1/2 hours after departure.  The pilot stated that he performed a preflight inspection of 
the airplane in a hanger equipped with fluorescent lighting.  He stated that he checked the fuel 
gauges, visually checked the fuel level in each tank, and that the fuel level in each fuel tank was 
"just under the tabs."  Postaccident inspection of the airplane revealed that the fuel selector 
was positioned to the left fuel tank and no usable fuel was noted in either fuel tank.
The inadequate in-flight planning/decision which resulted in fuel exhaustion and the loss of 
engine power.  Contributing factors were the muddy terrain and the vegetation.
