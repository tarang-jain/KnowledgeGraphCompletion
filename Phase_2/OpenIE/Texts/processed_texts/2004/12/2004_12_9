The airplane bounced and then veered off the eastern edge of the runway during landing 
following a visual approach to the airport.  The airplane then impacted terrain and a cement 
culvert.  Night visual meteorological conditions with a gusting crosswind prevailed at the time 
of the accident.  The pilot stated that the landing light ceased to operate during the approach, 
and he could not get the instrument panel lights to operate.  The flashlight that a passenger 
used ceased to operate after the reported instrument panel light(s) ceased to operate.  The pilot 
stated that after the airplane touched down, he rolled the yoke level and pulled back.  A gust of 
wind "quickly" moved the airplane off the runway.  Inspection of the airplane revealed the flaps 
were extended 30 degrees, and the rear passenger seats were not equipped with shoulder 
harnesses.  Postaccident operation of the landing/instrument panel light(s), for about 30 
seconds, noted that none of the instrument panel light(s) illuminated, the overhead light(s) 
illuminated, and the landing light illuminated.  No circuit breakers tripped during this 
operation.  The pilot had a total flight time of 69 hours, of which 22 hours were in the accident 
airplane.  He did not have any night flying time in the accident airplane.  The pilot's airman 
medical certificate had the following limitation: "not valid for night flight or by color signal 
control."
The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions and his failure to maintain 
directional control.  Contributing factors were the gusting crosswind, the pilot's lack of night 
flying of experience, the inoperative instrument lights, and the night conditions.
