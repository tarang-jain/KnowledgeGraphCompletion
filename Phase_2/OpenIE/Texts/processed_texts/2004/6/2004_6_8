The pilot landed, overran the 2,700-foot runway, and impacted a berm off the departure end of 
the runway.  The pilot was conducting a cross-country flight and mistook the accident airport 
for her destination airport, which is nearby and has a 5,000 foot-long runway.  She landed and 
could not stop the airplane prior to the runway's termination.  Review of the airplane's landing 
performance chart revealed that if the pilot landed the airplane at maximum gross weight with 
full flaps extended, it should have stopped at the 1,100-foot mark.  The pilot landed with the 
flaps retracted.  The pilot reported that there were no anomalies with the airplane or engine.
the pilot's misjudgment of speed and distance, which resulted in an overrun of the runway.  
The pilot's failure to use flaps and his landing at an airport with a runway shorter than he 
expected is a contributing factor.
