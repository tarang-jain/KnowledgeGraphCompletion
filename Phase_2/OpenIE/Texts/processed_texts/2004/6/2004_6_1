The airplane collided with the terrain following a loss of control during a go-around.  The 
student reported he maintained an airspeed of 70 miles per hour with 20 degrees of flaps until 
he began the landing flare.  He stated the airplane ballooned and drifted "slightly right" during 
the flare.  He applied left aileron in an attempt to realign the airplane, but it veered to the left.  
He stated he then added full power at which time the airplane banked to the left.  The left wing 
contacted the ground and the airplane cart wheeled, slid across a taxiway, and came to rest 
alongside a ditch.  The student pilot stated he made 5 takeoffs and landing with his flight 
instructor on the morning of the accident.  The accident occurred on the first solo landing of 
the day.  The accident occurred on the student's second supervised solo flight.  He reported 
having .5 hours of pilot in command flight time prior to this flight.
The student pilot failed to maintain control of the airplane during the go-around.  A factor 
associated with the accident was the student's lack of experience.
