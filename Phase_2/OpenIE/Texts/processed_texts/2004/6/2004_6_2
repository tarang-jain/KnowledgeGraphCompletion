The airplane was destroyed on impact with terrain and a house during a precision approach.  
Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  Examination of the 
airplane systems did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.  
Pilot logbook records indicated that the pilot did not have a current flight review.

HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On June 1, 2004, about 2040 central daylight time, a Cessna U206F, N81685, owned and 
piloted by a private pilot, impacted a house and terrain during a precision approach to 
Owatonna Degner Regional Airport (OWA), Owatonna, Minnesota.  Instrument meteorological 
conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The personal flight was operating on an 
instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) Part 91. The pilot, pilot-rated passenger, and two passengers were fatally injured; there 
were no ground injuries. The flight departed from Roseau Municipal/Rudy Billberg Field 
Airport (ROX), Roseau, Minnesota, about 1755, and was en route to OWA.
The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Report of Aircraft Accident reported the 
following conversations with N81685, Princeton Automated Flight Service Station (PNM 
AFSS), and Minneapolis Center Sector 05 Radar Controller (ZMP05), Sector 07 (ZMP07), and 
Sector 25 (ZMP25), Rochester Air Traffic Control Tower (RST), and an Unknown transmission.
At 1719, a person representing N81685 called PNM AFSS by telephone and requested an 
update on ceilings from ROX to OWA for a flight departing in about 15 minutes.
At 1735, a person representing N81685 called PNM AFSS by telephone and filed an IFR flight 
plan for a flight from ROX to OWA departing at 1755.
At 1750, N81685 initiated radio contact airborne after departure from ROX.  N81685 was 
issued an IFR clearance to OWA and assigned an altitude of five thousand feet mean sea level 
(MSL).
At 1756, N81685 reported level at five thousand feet MSL.
At 1828, N81685 reported a position at the Bemidji very high frequency omni-directional range 
(VOR) 330 degree radial and requested to climb to seven thousand feet MSL.  The ZMP25 
controller assigned an altitude of seven thousand feet.
At 2005, N81685 contacted Minneapolis Center, reporting an altitude of 'four point zero.'  The 
ZMP09 controller instructed N81685 to proceed direct to Halfway VOR.  N81685 reported 
direct Halfway VOR now.

AIDS TO NAVIAGATION
The OWA Instrument landing system runway 30 (ILS RWY 30) approach depicted TONNA, a 
nondirectional radio beacon, as the approach's locater outer marker / instrument approach fix 
located 5 nautical miles on a course of 302 degrees to runway 30.  The TONNA frequency was 
depicted as 379 kilohertz (kHz).  The initial and intermediate segment altitudes were 2,900 
feet mean sea level (MSL) and the description height for all categories of aircraft was 1,345 feet 
MSL or 200 feet AGL and 1/2 statute mile visibility.
The ILS RWY 30 approach lists only FARMINGTON VOR, located 33.5 NM on a 172 degree 
course to TONNA, and ROCHESTER VOR located 29.9 NM on a 302 degree course to TONNA.  
The VOR / DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) RWY 30 approach lists only HALFWAY 
VOR.
A flight inspection of the OWA ILS RWY 30 was conducted on June 2, 2004, by the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA).  The Flight Inspection Report -  Instrument Landing System 
stated that "facility operation found satisfactory."
AIRPORT INFORMATION
OWA has an airport elevation of 1,146 feet MSL and is equipped with runway 12-30 (5,500 feet 
by 100 feet, concrete) and is served by VOR/DME and ILS approaches to runway 30.  Runway 
30 is equipped with a medium intensity approach light system with a runway alignment system 
and runway alignment indicator lights.  Lighting for runway 12-30 consists of high intensity 
pilot controlled lighting, runway 12 has pilot controlled runway end identifier lights, and 
runway 30 has runway end identifier lights.  Both runways are equipped with 4-identical light 
unit precision approach path indictor lighting systems.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The wreckage area was located in an agricultural field about 4.36 nautical miles and 301 
degrees from OWA at the following Global Positioning System Coordinates: 44 degrees 04.789 
minutes North, 093 degree 09.918 minutes West, elevation of 1,267 feet MSL.  The wreckage 
path, which was about 1,900 feet in length and oriented on a magnetic direction of 160 degrees, 
consisted of a damaged house, trees, and airplane wreckage.
 
The damaged house had a 3-foot wide swath of roof damage that contained pieces of the 
airplane's left wing.  A 10 foot by 5 foot by 4 foot deep ground scar contained the propeller, 
which was separated from the engine and buried within the ground scar. Both propeller blades 
exhibited S-shaped bending, twisting, and chordwise scoring.  The engine and nose section of 
the airplane was located several feet southeast of the ground scar.  
Both wing fuel bladders were broken open and a smell consistent with aviation fuel was 
present at the accident site.  The fuel selector contained a liquid consistent in color and smell to 
100 low lead aviation fuel, and the selector was between the off and the left fuel tank positions.
The flight control system was destroyed and all control surfaces were located along in the 
wreckage area.  Inspection of the aileron, elevator, rudder, and flap control cables exhibited 
necking consistent with ductile fracture; no worn or abraded areas were noted at these areas.   
The trim tab actuator was separated from its mounting surface and was extended 
approximately 2.2 inches, which equates to a 25-degree tab up (nose down position).  The flap 
jack screw was extended about 0.5 inches, which equates to a flap position of 0-5 degrees.  
The engine driven vacuum pump was attached to the engine and removed for inspection.  The 
inspection revealed that the vacuum pump drive shaft was intact and the drive shaft gearing 
was undamaged. The attitude indicator and directional indicator gyros were moved by hand 
about their gimbals without binding.  Both gyros were then disassembled and noted to have 
circumferential scoring on the gyro and interior gyro housing.  
The instrument panel exhibited impact damage.  The tachometer gauge indicated 
approximately 2,900 rpm and a tachometer time of 2,048.4 hours.  The altimeter indicated 
approximately 1,100 feet MSL and the altimeter's setting window indicated 29.68 inches of 
mercury.  The automatic direction finder receiver indicated a frequency of 379 kHz.  The 
ignition switch was in the "Both" position.  The "Stby Vac" control knob was in the full forward 
position.
The engine components and accessories were intact except for the fuel pump, oil filter, and 
vacuum pump.  The fuel metering unit was connected by a fuel line.  The oil sump was crushed 
and the number six cylinder head was crushed and deformed in the aft direction.  The left side 
intake and exhaust pipes were separated and the forward section of the oil sump was 
separated.  Both forward sections of the crankcase halves were crushed to the aft area of the 
number six cylinder attachment point.  The crankshaft was separated aft of the propeller 
attachment flange.
The oil filter was opened and inspection of the filter element revealed an absence of metallic 
debris.
The left magneto was broken in half and the rear half was missing.  The right magneto 
exhibited impacted damage and could not be rotated by hand.  The top spark plugs, Champion 
RHB-32E, were removed and displayed a color about their electrodes consistent with normal 
wear as depicted in the Champion Aviation Check-A-Plug Card.  
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
Autopsies of the pilot and pilot-rated passenger were conducted by the Hennepin County 
Medical Examiner's Office on June 3, 2004.
The FAA's Final Forensic Toxicology Fatal Accident Report of the pilot reported that no 
ethanol and no listed drugs were detected in muscle.   
The FAA's Final Forensic Toxicology Fatal Accident Report of the pilot-rated passenger states: 
16 (mg/dL, mg/hg) ethanol and 6 (mg/dL, mg/hg) acetaldehyde detected in muscle.  The 
report notes: the ethanol found in this case is potentially from postmortem ethanol formation 
and not from the ingestion of ethanol.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The FAA, Cessna Aircraft, and Teledyne Continental Motors were parties to the investigation.
