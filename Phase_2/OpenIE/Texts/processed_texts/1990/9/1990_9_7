DURING A WX BRIEFING THE PILOT WAS ADVISED THAT VFR FLIGHT WAS NOT 
RECOMMENDED, PASSES WERE CLOSED, AND THAT TWO PILOT REPORTS INDICATED 
CLOUDS WERE TO THE GROUND NEAR A PASS. THE PILOT SUBSEQUENTLY 
CONTACTED ANCHORAGE APPROACH CONTROL STATING HE WAS 73 MI NORTH OF 
ANCHORAGE, LANDING, AND REQUESTED TRAFFIC SEPARATION AND RADAR 
VECTORS. APPROACH REPLIED THAT THE PILOT WAS TOO FAR NORTH FOR 
COVERAGE, AND TO MAINTAIN VFR CONDITIONS. THE WRECKAGE WAS LOCATED AT 
THE 4,000-FT LEVEL OF A 4,500-FT HIGH RIDGE/MOUNTAIN, IN AN AREA NEAR 
WHERE THE MINIMUM ENROUTE ALTITUDE (MEA), OR MINIMUM OBSTRUCTION 
ALTITUDE (MOCA), CHANGE FROM 10,000 FEET TO 7,500 FEET SOUTHBOUND. 
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S CONTINUED VFR FLIGHT INTO INSTRUMENT 
METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, AND FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE ALTITUDE 
FOR TERRAIN CLEARANCE. FACTORS TO THE ACCIDENT WERE THE ADVERSE 
WEATHER CONDITIONS, MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN, AND THE DARK NIGHT.
