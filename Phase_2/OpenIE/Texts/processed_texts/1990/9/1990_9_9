 AFTER COMPLETING A X-COUNTRY FLIGHT, THE PILOT TOOK OFF WITH 2 PSGRS ABOARD 
TO FLY TO A NEARBY ARPT TO REFUEL. AFTER TAKING OFF FROM RUNWAY 35, THE ENG 
LOST PWR. THE AIRCRAFT CRASHED ABT 1/4 MI NORTH OF THE RUNWAY AND TO THE LEFT OF 
THE RUNWAY CENTERLINE. IMPACT OCCURRED IN A LEFT WING LOW ATTITUDE. THE 
AIRCRAFT CAME TO REST NOSE DOWN WITH THE TAIL BROKEN DOWN AND TO THE RIGHT. 
ONLY ABT 7 0Z OF FUEL WAS FND IN THE AIRCRAFT. LATER, THE ENGE WAS 
SUCCESSFULLY RUN DURING AN OPNL CHECK. THE PILOT HAD 3 HRS OF FLIGHT TIME IN 
THIS MAKE AND MODEL OF AIRCRAFT. 
THE PILOT'S MISJUDGEMENT OF THE FUEL SUPPLY, AND HIS FAILURE TO MAINTAIN 
ADEQUATE AIRSPEED. A FACTOR WAS THE PILOT'S LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN THE 
MAKE AND MODEL OF AIRCRAFT.
