THE HELICOPTER COLLIDED WITH POWER LINES WHILE ON A DOWNWIND TO THE 
HELIPAD. ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, THE HELICOPTER WAS TRAVELLING 
PERPENDICULAR TO AN ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION LINE AT ABOUT 60 KNOTS 
WHEN IT COLLIDED WITH THE TOP OF A TWO WIRE SET AT ABOUT 30 FEET AGL. 
PAINT TRANSFER FROM THE T/R SKID WAS FOUND ON THE DAMAGED POWER LINE. 
AFTER STRIKING THE WIRE THE T/R SEPARATED AT THE GEAR BOX MOUNTING 
FLANGE; SMALL PIECES OF THE T/R BLADE WERE FOUND ON THE GROUND BELOW 
THE POINT OF INITIAL WIRE CONTACT. THE PILOT STATED THAT DURING THE 
DOWNWIND CLIMBING TURN AFTER TAKEOFF, AND WHILE PASSING OVER A GULLY 
NEAR A 6,200-FT RIDGE, HE HAD AN ENCOUNTER WITH WINDSHEAR AT 230 FEET 
AGL WHICH RESULTED IN LOSS OF 200 FEET AND THE SUBSEQUENT COLLISION. THE 
EXISTENCE OF THE REPORTED 'WINDSHEAR', OR POSSIBLE DOWNDRAFT COULD 
NOT BE VERIFIED. 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE PATTERN ALTITUDE AND THE 
POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF ADVERSE WINDS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING TERRAIN.
