DURING NORMAL CRUISE FLIGHT, THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE RPM WAS 
DECREASING AND THE OIL TEMPERATURE WAS INCREASING. THE ENG THEN SEIZED. 
WITH POOR FWD VISIBILITY DUE TO OIL COVERING THE WINDSCREEN, HE 
OVERSHOT THE FIELD HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO LAND IN. THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH 
A FENCE THEN NOSED OVER. EXAM OF THE ENG REVEALED THAT THE NUMBER 3 
CYLINDER CONNECTING ROD END CAP SEPARATED, EXISTED THE CASE AND CAME TO 
REST IN THE OIL SUMP. LYCOMING ENG PERSONNEL STATED THAT THE SEPARATION 
OF THE ROD CAP WAS DUE TO A LACK OF LUBRICATION WHICH CAUSED THE ROD 
BOLTS TO STRETCH, LOSING THEIR TORQUE, AND ONE OF THE TWO NUTS VIBRATED 
OFF. THE OTHER ROD BOLT FAILED DUE TO OVERLOAD. THE ENG RECEIVED A TOP 
OVERHAUL 136 HRS EARLIER AND A MAJOR OVERHAUL WAS PERFORMED 2,122 HRS 
EARLIER. NO DETERMINATION COULD BE MADE AS TO THE REASON FOR THE LACK 
OF LUBRICATION. 
ENGINE FAILURE DUE TO LACK OF OIL SUPPLY TO THE NUMBER 3 CYLINDER 
CONNECTING ROD FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS. THIS ALLOWED THE 
CONNECTING ROD END CAP TO SEPARATE THROUGH THE CASE RESULTING IN OIL 
EXHAUSTION.
