THE STUDENT PILOT HAD BEEN FLYING HIS BALLOON FOR ABOUT AN HOUR WHEN 
HE ELECTED TO LAND. HE ATTEMPTED TO LAND IN AN ESTIMATED 15 KNOT WIND. 
HE SAID THAT WHEN THE BALLOON TOUCHED DOWN, THE WIND STARTED TO DRAG 
THE BALLOON TOWARD SOME ELECTRICAL POWER LINES. HE JUMPED OUT OF THE 
BASKET JUST PRIOR TO THE BALLOON STRIKING THE WIRES. THE BALLOON 
SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE TO THE ENVELOPE IN A POSTACCIDENT FIRE. 
THE STUDENT PILOT'S IMPROPER INFLIGHT PLANNING AND INACCURATE 
EVALUATION OF THE SURFACE WEATHER. A FACTOR WAS THE UNFAVORABLE WIND.
