DURING FLIGHT BEFORE ACCIDENT FLIGHT, THE LANDING GEAR MALFUNCTIONED. 
EMERGENCY GEAR EXTENSION WAS ACCOMPLISHED BUT REQUIRED EXCESSIVE 
FORCE. MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL LUBRICATED THE NOSE GEAR RETRACT CHAIN AND 
ADJUSTED THE GEAR DOWN LIGHT INDICATOR SWITCH. THE AIRPLANE WAS FLOWN 
WITH NO DISCREPANCIES NOTED. THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT WAS UNEVENTFUL UNTIL 
AFTER LOWERING THE LANDING GEAR SELECTOR HANDLE, THE GEAR DID NOT 
FULLY EXTEND. THE EMERGENCY METHOD WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. THE MAIN GEAR 
COLLAPSED DURING THE LANDING ROLL. EXAM OF THE LANDING GEAR SYSTEM 
REVEALED THAT THE NOSE GEAR ACTUATOR WAS SEIZED DUE TO LACK OF 
LUBRICATION. THE AIRCRAFT LOGBOOKS INDICATE THAT ALL GEAR ACTUATORS WERE 
REPLACED ON 8-23-86. THERE WERE NO FURTHER ENTRIES INDICATING THAT THEY 
WERE LUBRICATED. ACCORDING TO THE MAINT MANUAL, THE ACTUATORS SHOULD 
BE REMOVED FOR LUBRICATION EVERY 1,000 CYCLES OF OPERATION OR 30 MOS., 
WHICHEVER OCCURS FIRST. THE AIRCRAFT ACCUMULATED 3,154 CYCLES SINCE 
REPLACEMENT OF THE ACTUATORS. 
THE LACK OF LUBRICATION BY MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL OF THE NOSE LANDING 
GEAR ACTUATOR.
