THE PILOT STATED THAT, WHILE IN CRUISE FLIGHT IN IFR CONDITIONS AND 
MODERATE RAIN, THE AIRCRAFT EXPERIENCED A COMPLETE LOSS OF ENGINE 
POWER. ATTEMPTS TO RESTART THE ENGINE WERE UNSUCESSFUL, AND A FORCED 
LANDING WAS PERFORMED. THE AIRCRAFT TRAVELED OVER A SLIGHT 
EMBANKMENT, THE NOSE WHEEL DUG INTO THE GROUND AND THE AIRCRAFT 
NOSED OVER. POST-ACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE, ITS ACCESSORIES, 
AND THE FUEL SYSTEM REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF PRE-IMPACT MECHANICAL 
MALFUNCTION. 
THE PILOT'S ENCOUNTER WITH UNSUITABLE TERRAIN DURING THE LANDING ROLL 
AFTER A FORCED LANDING. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS IN THIS ACCIDENT WERE THE 
TOTAL POWERPLANT FAILURE AND THE IFR WEATHER CONDITIONS WHICH 
LIMITED THE LANDING SITE SELECTION.
