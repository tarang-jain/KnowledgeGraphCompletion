THE PRIVATE GLIDER PILOT WAS ATTEMPTING AN AEROTOW TAKEOFF UTILIZING A 
CESSNA 150 AS A TOW PLANE. DURING THE TAKEOFF, THE TOW PLANE ABORTED 
THE TAKEOFF. WHEN THE GLIDER PILOT REALIZED THAT THE TOW PLANE HAD 
ABORTED THE TAKEOFF, HE WAS ALREADY AIRBORNE AND DID NOT HAVE 
SUFFICIENT RUNWAY LEFT TO LAND. WHILE MANEUVERING THE AIRCRAFT FOR AN 
EMERGENCY LANDING, THE AIRCRAFT STALLED AND COLLIDED WITH THE TERRAIN. 
SUBSEQUENT INVESGIATION REVEALED NO MECHANIC MALFUNCTIONS WITH 
EITHER THE GLIDER OR THE TOW PLANE. 
THE INATTENTIVENESS OF THE GLIDER PILOT TO THE ABORTED TAKEOFF OF THE 
TOW PLANE, WHICH RESULTED IN HIS DELAYED ACTION IN ATTEMPTING TO 
EXECUTE A FORCED LANDING. THESE ACTIONS RESULTED IN AN INADVERTENT 
STALL AND THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH THE TERRAIN.
