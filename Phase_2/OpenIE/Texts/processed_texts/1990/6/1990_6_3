THE PILOT RPRTD THAT DURING AN APPROACH TO LAND AT A REMOTE STRIP, THE AIRCRAFT 
SLOWED AND 'GOT BEHIND THE POWER CURVE.' SUBSEQUENTLY, IT HIT THE GROUND, 
WHICH BUCKLED THE FUSELAGE. THE PILOT HAD ABOUT 10,000 HRS OF FLIGHT TIME, BUT 
ONLY 20 HOURS IN HELIOCOURIER. 
THE PILOT'S IMPROPER FLARE, WHICH RESULTED IN A HARD LANDING.  THE 
PILOT'S LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN THE MAKE AND MODEL OF AIRCRAFT WAS A 
RELATED FACTOR.
