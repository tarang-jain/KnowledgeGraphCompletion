 WITNESSES NOTICED THE AIRPLANE WAS ON FINAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 14 
WITH THE GEAR UP.  SOME OF THE WITNESSES RADIOED THE PILOT TO ALERT HIM 
OF THE GEAR POSITION, BUT HE DID NOT RESPOND.  THE AIRPLANE LANDED GEAR 
UP, BUT SOON AFTERWARDS, IT BECAME AIRBORNE, CLIMBED ABOUT 30 FEET, AND 
DESCENDED IN A LEFT BANK. THE AIRPLANE STRUCK THE GROUND EAST OF THE 
RUNWAY AND CARTWHEELED; IT CAME TO A STOP ON AN ADJACENT TAXIWAY. AN 
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THERE WERE ABOUT 60 PROPELLER SLASH MARKS ON 
THE RUNWAY.  AN AIRCRAFT EXAMINATION DID NOT DISCLOSE EVIDENCE OF 
MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION. EXAMINATION OF THE LANDING GEAR ACTUATOR 
REVEALED IT WAS IN A TRANSIT POSITION, WHICH WAS ABOUT THREE TURNS OF 
THE MANUAL GEAR HANDLE FROM THE FULL UP (RETRACTED) POSITION OF THE 
GEAR. 
 FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO EXTEND THE LANDING GEAR, WHICH RESULTED IN A 
WHEELS UP LANDING; HIS IMPROPER DECISION TO ATTEMPT A GO AROUND 
(ABORTED LANDING) AFTER THE AIRPLANE CONTACTED THE RUNWAY; AND HIS 
FAILURE TO ATTAIN OR MAINTAIN ADEQUATE AIRSPEED WHILE ATTEMPTING TO 
CLIMB AFTER LIFTOFF.
