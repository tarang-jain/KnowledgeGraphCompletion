THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO COMPLETE A FLIGHT FROM 
ANCHORAGE TO MCGRATH AND RETURN WITHOUT REFUELING. HE TOPPED OFF 
THE FUEL TANKS IN ANCHORAGE PRIOR TO DEPARTURE. PRIOR TO LEAVING 
MCGRATH, HE VISUALLY INSPECTED, BUT DID NOT STICK THE TANKS. HE THOUGHT 
THE FUEL TANKS WERE SLIGHTLY MORE THAN ONE-HALF FULL. APPROXIMATELY 10 
MILES FROM ANCHORAGE THE ENGINE SPUTTERED AND EVENTUALLY STOPPED. A 
FORCED LANDING WAS MADE IN THE TUNDRA. THE PILOT LATER STATED THAT IT IS 
MOST LIKELY THAT THE ENGINE QUIT DUE TO FUEL EXHAUSTION. 
THE PILOT'S FUEL MISMANAGEMENT IN NOT HAVING SUFFICIENT FUEL TO REACH 
HIS DESTINATION.
