DURING A FERRY FLIGHT FOR MAINTENANCE, THE PILOT CIRCLED THE PRIVATE 
AIRSTRIP FOR WIND DIRECTION. THE PILOT BEGAN THE DESCENT FOR LANDING 
AND NOTED A ROW OF POWER LINES. THE AIRPLANE CLEARED THAT ROW OF LINES, 
HOWEVER, THERE WAS A SECOND ROW THAT THE PILOT HAD NOT OBSERVED. THE 
AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH THE SECOND ROW. THE AIRPLANE TOUCHED DOWN 
SHORT OF THE RUNWAY AND DURING THE LANDING ROLL NOSED OVER. THE LEFT 
WING IGNITED AND BURNED THE LEFT SIDE ONLY. 
THE PILOTS POORLY PLANNED APPROACH FOR LANDING.
