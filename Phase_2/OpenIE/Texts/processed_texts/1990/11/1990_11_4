THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR SAID THAT THE FLIGHT FLEW TO THE AIRSTRIP AT 
MARICOPA, ARIZONA, IN ORDER THAT THE 16 HOUR PRIMARY STUDENT COULD 
PRACTICE TAKEOFFS AND LANDINGS. ACCORDING TO THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR, 
THE AIRCRAFT WAS ON A STABILIZED SHORT FINAL APPROACH WITH FULL FLAPS 
AND AT ABOUT 60 KNOTS INDICATED AIRSPEED. AS THE AIRCRAFT CROSSED A ROW 
OF TREES ORIENTED PERPENDICULAR TO THE RUNWAY THE AIRSPEED SUDDENLY 
DROPPED TO 40 KNOTS INDICATED AND THE AIRCRAFT ENTERED A SINK RATE THAT 
COULD NOT BE ARRESTED PRIOR TO THE AIRCRAFT LANDING HARD ON THE 
RUNWAY. THE INSTRUCTOR STATED THAT THE WINDS WERE ABOUT 15 KNOTS 
DOWN THE RUNWAY WITH GUSTS TO 25 KNOTS. 
THE FAILURE OF THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR TO ENSURE THAT AN ADEQUATE 
AIRSPEED WAS MAINTAINED DURING THE FINAL APPROACH FOR THE EXISTING 
WIND CONDITIONS; TO ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE THE CONDUCT OF THE FLIGHT; 
AND TO ARREST THE RATE OF DESCENT PRIOR TO TOUCH DOWN.
