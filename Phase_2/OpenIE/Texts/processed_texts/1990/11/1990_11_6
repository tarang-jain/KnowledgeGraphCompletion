THE NIGHT, VFR FLIGHT WAS DISPAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLHED TO A STRETCH OF INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 
TO PICK UP A PATIENT. PRIOR TO LANDING THE LZ WAS SEARCHED FOR 
OBSTRUCTIONS WITH THE 'NIGHT SUN', AND THE GROUND PERSONNEL ALSO 
INSPECTED THE LZ. NO OBSTRUCTIONS WERE REPORTED OR OBSERVED IN THE 
IMMEDIATE LZ AREA. AFTER LANDING, THE PILOT ALSO WALKED THE DEPARTURE 
CORRIDOR WITH A FLASHLIGHT. SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF, THE HELICOPTER 
COLLIDED WITH FOUR WIRES WHICH WERE STRUNG ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. 
NEITHER THE FLIGHT CREW NOR THE GROUND PERSONNEL SAW THE WIRES PRIOR 
TO THE COLLISION. THE WIRES WERE BLACK IN COLOR, AND THE POLES WERE 
HIDDEN BY BUILDINGS AND TREES. ALSO, HIGH INTENSITY LIGHT STANDARDS 
LINED THE HIGHWAY AT THE LZ. 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO SEE AND AVOID THE WIRES PRIOR TO THE COLLISION. 
FACTORS IN THE INCIDENT WERE THE FAILURE OF THE GROUND PERSONNEL TO 
ADEQUATELY INSPECT THE LANDING ZONE, THE PRESENCE OF HIGH INTENSITY 
LIGHTS AT THE LZ, AND THE DARK LIGHTING CONDITIONS.
