THE AIRCRAFT WAS LOADED OVER GROSS WEIGHT WITH A CG OUTSIDE THE REAR 
ENVELOPE LIMIT. THE PIC AND REPORTER PROCEEDED TO THE SITE OF AN AUTO 
ACCIDENT. EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE FACT THAT THE REPORTER, WHO WAS 
CURRENTLY RECEIVING DUAL INSTRUCTION AND HELD AN EXPIRED STUDENT 
PILOT CERTIFICATE, WAS FLYING THE AIRCRAFT. THE AIRCRAFT VIOLATED 
COMPANY MINIMUM ALTITUDE LIMITS BY DESCENDING TO ABOUT 800 FEET AGL AND 
INITIATED A SERIES OF STEEP TURNS AT SLOW AIRSPEED. STATEMENTS FROM 
OTHER PILOTS ESTABLISHED THAT THE REPORTER LIKED TO CROSS CONTROL THE 
AIRCRAFT IN ORDER TO HAVE A BETTER VIEW OF THE GROUND. GROUND 
WITNESSES OBSERVED THE AIRCRAFT PERFORM AN ABRUPT MANEUVER THEN SPIN 
TO THE GROUND. 
THE INADVERTENT STALL/SPIN. FACTORS IN THE ACCIDENT WERE: THE PILOT'S 
DECISION TO ALLOW THE REPORTER PASSENGER TO FLY THE AIRCRAFT IN A 
CRITICAL FLIGHT SITUATION, HIS DECISION TO ALLOW THE AIRCRAFT TO DESCEND 
TO AN ALTITUDE TOO LOW TO ALLOW FOR CONTINGENCIES, AND THE FAILURE OF 
THE PILOT IN COMMAND TO ENSURE THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS PROPERLY LOADED.
