DURING A NIGHT IFR TRAINING FLIGHT, ON FINAL APPROACH THE ENGINE FAILED 
TO RESPOND WHEN ADDITIONAL, NEEDED THROTTLE WAS ADDED. THE CFI TOOK 
OVER THE CONTROLS AND TURNED TO AN ADJACENT FIELD, SHORT OF THE 
RUNWAY, WHERE AN EMERGENCY LANDING WAS ATTEMPTED WHICH RESULTED IN 
A NOSE OVER. POST ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE FUEL MIXTURE 
CONTROL TO BE IN THE OUT, OR IDLE CUTOFF POSITION. NO DEFECTS, 
MALFUNCTIONS OF FUEL SHORTAGES WERE DISCOVERED, AND ENGINE RUN-UP 
NORMAL. 
THE MIXTURE CONTROL WAS SET INCORRECTLY RESULTING IN FUEL STARVATION, 
AND THE CHECK LIST WAS NOT FOLLOWED BY THE CFI/PIC.
