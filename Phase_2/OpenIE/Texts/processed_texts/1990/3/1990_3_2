THE AIRCRAFT WAS EQUIPPED WITH A TEMPORARY FUEL SYS TO FERRY IT TO SOUTH 
AFRICA.  ALSO, IT WAS APPROVED FOR SPECIAL FLIGHT OPNS AND A MAXIMUM GROSS WT 
LIMITATION OF 4235 LBS.  ITS ACTUAL WEIGHT FOR TAKEOFF WAS CALCULATED TO 
BE 3956 LBS.  THE PILOT TOOK OFF ON RUNWAY 16 FOR THE INITIAL FLIGHT WITH THE WIND 
FROM ABOUT 240 DEG AT 17 KTS.  SHORTLY AFTER LIFT-OFF, THE AIRCRAFT WAS 
OBSERVED FLYING JUST ABOVE THE TREES IN A NOSE HI ATTITUDE. THE PILOT 
TURNED THE AIRCRAFT ABOUT 90 DEG TO THE LEFT TOWARD A RIVER (DOWN SLOPE).  
HE THEN TURNED IT FURTHER LEFT AND ALIGNED ITS FLIGHT PATH WITH THE RIVER.  
HOWEVER, THE AIRCRAFT HIT A POLE ON A BOAT DOCK AND CRASHED IN THE RIVER.  NO 
PREIMPACT PART FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OF THE AIRCRAFT WAS FOUND DURING 
THE INVESTIGATION.  ONE WITNESS, WHO SAW THE AIRCRAFT AFTER TAKEOFF, SAID IT 
WAS MUSHING AS THE LNDG GEAR WAS BEING RETRACTED, THEN THE PILOT 'MADE A 
STEEP BANK TO THE LEFT AND WENT BELOW THE TREES.' 
PREMATURE LIFT-OFF BY THE PILOT, WHILE TAKING OFF WITH A HEAVY GROSS 
WEIGHT IN UNFAVORABLE WINDS, AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO ATTAIN/MAINTAIN 
ADEQUATE AIRSPEED, WHICH RESULTED IN AN INADVERTENT STALL/MUSH.
