TOUCHDOWN AUTOROTATIONS. AFTER A LANDING AND GROUND SLIDE, THEY BOTH 
NOTED VIBRATIONS, THEN SHUT DOWN THE ENGINE AND EXITED THE

THE TAIL ROTOR DRIVESHAFT. THE WIND AT 1450 CST WAS FROM 140 DEG AT 16 
GUSTING 22 KTS. 
THE FAILURE OF THE PILOT IN COMMAND/INSTRUCTOR PILOT TO MAINTAIN 
ADEQUATE ROTOR RPM AFTER LANDING FROM A TOUCHDOWN AUTOROTATION. A 
FACTOR RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE GUSTY WIND CONDITION.
