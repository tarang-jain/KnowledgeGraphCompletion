THE PILOT WAS PRACTICING AIRWORK DURING A SOLO TRAINING FLIGHT, WHEN A 
PARTIAL LOSS OF POWER OCCURRED. HE APPLIED CARB HEAT AND POWER WAS 
TEMPORARILY RESTORED BEFORE IT DECREASED AGAIN. UNABLE TO MAINTAIN 
POWER, THE PILOT SELECTED A FIELD FOR A FORCED LANDING. THE FIELD HAD A 
STEEP SLOPE. DURING THE LANDING, THE NOSE GEAR CONTACTED THE TERRAIN 
FIRST AND THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER. DURING TESTS, THE CARB HEAT OPERATED 
NORMALLY. TEMP AND DEW POINT AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WERE 31 DEGS F 
AND 22 DEGS F, RESPECTIVELY. ACCORDING TO CARB ICE PROBABILITY CHARTS, 
THIS CONDITION WAS CONDUCIVE TO CARB ICE DURING GLIDE POWER SETTINGS. 
THE PILOT'S IMPROPER USE OF CARBURETOR HEAT, WHEN OPERATING AT 
REDUCED POWER IN CONDITIONS WHICH WERE CONDUCIVE TO CARBURETOR ICE.
