DURING A NIGHT CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT, THE AIRPLANE BEGAN TO CLIMB, THEN 
SUDDENLY ENTERED A LEFT DESCENDING TURN UNTIL COLLISION WITH THE 
TERRAIN. THE WEATHER ALONG THE FLIGHT COURSE WAS FORECAST TO HAVE 
MOUNTAINS OCCASIONALLY OBSCURED WITH CLOUDS AND THE FREEZING LEVEL 
WAS LOW. DURING THE ON-SCENE INVESTIGATION, THERE WERE NO NOTED 
MECHANICAL FAILURES OR MALFUNCTIONS WITH THE AIRPLANE. 
UNCONTROLLED SPIRALLING DESCENT THAT THE PILOT DID NOT ADEQUATELY 
RECOVER FROM. THE PILOTS LACK OF TOTAL EXPERIENCE IN THIS TYPE OF 
OPERATION AND THE DARK NIGHT CONDITION ARE A FACTOR.
