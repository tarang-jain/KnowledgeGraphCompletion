THE AG PILOT WAS SPREADING SEED RICE ON THE FIELD, AND DURING THE SECOND 
PASS, THE ENGINE STOPPED, THEN RESUMED POWER. THIS OCCURRED 2 MORE 
TIMES. THE PILOT TIRED TO GET TO A ROAD FOR A FORCED LANDING, BUT HAD TO 
LAND IN A FLOODED RICE FIELD. AT TOUCHDOWN, THE AIRPLANE FLIPPED 
FORWARD TO THE INVERTED POSITION. THE AIRPLANE WAS DEMOLISHED, BUT THE 
COMMERCIAL PILOT WAS NOT INJURED. AFTER RECOVERY, THE NUMBER FOUR 
CYLINDER INTAKE VALVE ROCKER BOX HOUSING WAS FOUND TO BE CRACKED. 
PARTIAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DUE TO A CRACKED NUMBER FOUR CYLINDER 
INTAKE ROCKER BOX HOUSING. THE LACK OF A SUITABLE FORCED LANDING SITE 
WAS A RELATED FACTOR.
