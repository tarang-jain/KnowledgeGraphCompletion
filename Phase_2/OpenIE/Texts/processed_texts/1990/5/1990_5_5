THE SOLO STUDENT PILOT STATED THAT THE AIRCRAFT DEVELOPED A HIGH SINK 
RATE DURING THE LANDING SEQUENCE, WHICH RESULTED IN A HARD, BOUNCED 
LANDING. THE AIRCRAFT VEERED OFF THE RUNWAY BEFORE IT CAME TO A STOP. 
THE STUDENT PILOT REPORTED A TOTAL FLIGHT TIME OF 38 HOURS, OF WHICH 6.4 
HOURS WERE AS PILOT-IN-COMMAND. 
THE STUDENT'S IMPROPER FLARE, IMPROPER RECOVERY FROM A BOUNCED 
LANDING, AND FAILURE TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL. THE CROSSWIND 
WAS A RELATED FACTOR.
