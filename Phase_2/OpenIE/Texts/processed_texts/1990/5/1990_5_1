AFTER RUNNING OUT OF FUEL, THE HELICOPTER WAS AUTOROTATED INTO A 
WOODED AREA, RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. THE PILOT STATED THAT 
LACK OF SUFFICIENT REST CONTRIBUTED TO FAILING TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE 
FUEL TANK COULD NOT BE COMPLETELY REFUELED BECAUSE THE AIRCRAFT WAS 
PARKED ON A SLOPE DURING REFUELING. HE ALSO STATED THAT FATIGUE MAY 
HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO HIS DECISION TO TRY TO MAKE IT TO THE AIRPORT EVEN 
THOUGH HE KNEW HE WAS RUNNING OUT OF FUEL. 
THE PILOT'S IMPROPER PREFLIGHT AND IMPROPER IN-FLIGHT 
PLANNING/DECISION. PILOT FATIGUE WAS A RELATED FACTOR.
