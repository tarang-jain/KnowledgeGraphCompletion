THE PILOT REPORTED THAT WHEN THE FLIGHT BEGAN, THE LOCAL SURFACE WIND 
WAS NOT OVER 3 MPH. HOWEVER, AS THE FLIGHT PROGRESSED, HE NOTED THAT 
THE WIND SPEED WAS INCREASING AND HE ELECTED TO TERMINATE THE FLIGHT. 
THE PILOT SAID THAT WHEN HE TOUCHED DOWN THE SURFACE WIND HAD 
INCREASED TO BETWEEN 8 AND 12 MPH. THE BALOON LANDED HARD, BOUNCED 30 
TO 40 FEET UP IN THE AIR, AND THEN LANDED HARD AGAIN. 
THE PILOT'S IMPROPER FLARE TECHNIQUE WHICH RESULTED IN A HARD LANDING. 
A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT WAS THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF A HIGH WIND 
CONDITION.
