DURING THE INITIAL CLIMB AFTER TAKE OFF THE ENGINE BEGAN TO RUN 
ROUGHLY AND THEN QUIT. A HARD LANDING WAS MADE IN A CLEARING ADJACENT TO 
THE RUNWAY WHEN THE PILOT INTENTIONALLY STALLED THE AIRPLANE AND 
ALLOWED IT TO MUSH INTO THE GROUND. THE AIRPLANE WAS FUELED WITH A 
MIXTURE OF 100LL AND AUTOMOTIVE, ACCORDING TO THE PILOT. HE ALSO STATED 
THAT THE CARBURETOR HEAT CHECKED NORMALLY BEFORE TAKE OFF. THE 
CARBURETOR HEAT WAS LEFT IN THE ON POSITION WHILE THE AIRPLANE  WAS 
POSITIONED FOR TAKE OFF ON THE RUNWAY. THE AUTOMOTIVE FUEL STC 
INDICATES THAT CARBURETOR ICE WILL FORM EARLIER WITH AUTO FUEL, UNDER 
CONDUCIVE ATOMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS. CARBURETOR ICING CONDITIONS 
EXISTED AT THE TIME OF THE TAKE OFF. 
LOSS OF ENGINE POWER BECAUSE OF CARBURETOR ICING CONDITIONS. A FACTOR 
IN THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT'S IMPROPER USE OF CARBURETOR HEAT.
