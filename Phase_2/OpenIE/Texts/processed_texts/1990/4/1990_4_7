THE AIRPLANE STARTED A TAKEOFF ROLL APPROXIMATELY 20 SECONDS AFTER A 
PRECEDING AIRPLANE. AS THE AIRPLANE BROKE GROUND, IT WAS OBSERVED TO 
ROLL 90 DEGREES TO THE RIGHT FOLLOWED BY A 180 DEGREE ROLL TO THE LEFT 
AND THEN ROLL WINGS LEVEL. THE PILOT SAID HE DID NOT THINK HE WOULD 
CLEAR THE TREES AHEAD OF THE AIRPLANE AND PULLED THE POWER OFF AND 
LANDED. THE AIRPLANE STRUCK TREES DURING THE GROUND ROLL. 
AN ENCOUNTER WITH WAKE TURBULENCE FROM A PRECEDING AIRPLANE. A 
FACTOR RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT'S DECISION TO TAKEOFF CLOSE 
BEHIND THE PRECEEDING AIRPLANE.
