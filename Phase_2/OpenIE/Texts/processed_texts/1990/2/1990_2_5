THE PILOT EXPERIENCED A REDUCTION IN ENGINE POWER ABOUT 400 FEET ABOVE 
THE GROUND WHILE PERFORMING A ROLLING MANEUVER. THIS WAS THE THIRD 
ROLL NEAR HIS HOME AS HIS FAMILY WAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLHED. REPORTEDLY, THE ENGINE 
'STALLED,' THE PILOT LOST CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE, AND IT CRASHED IN A 
WOODED AREA.  WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE CONDUCIVE TO THE FORMATION OF 
CARBURETOR ICING. THE AIRPLANE WAS NOT CERTIFIED FOR ROLLS.  WRECKAGE 
EXAMINATION FAILED TO DISCLOSE ANY PREIMPACT PART FAILURE OR 
MALFUNCTION. THE AIRPLANE WAS DESTROYED BY IMPACT FORCES AND A POST-
CRASH FIRE. 
CARBURETOR ICE DUE TO THE PILOT'S IMPROPER USE OF CARBURETOR HEAT, AND 
FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE AFTER THE 
ENGINE LOST POWER.  THE WEATHER (CARBURETOR ICING) CONDITION WAS A 
RELATED FACTOR.
