DURING AN APPROACH TO LANDING, THE BALLOON PILOT ESTIMATED THAT THE 
WIND HAD GROWN STRONGER THAN ANTICIPATED. HE SAID HE ATTEMPTED TO 
SPILL AIR TO INCREASE THE RATE OF DESCENT BY USE OF THE RED LINE, BUT IT 
SLIPPED THROUGH HIS GLOVED HAND. HE SAID THE BALLOON WAS CARRIED 300 
FEET FARTHER THAN THE PLANNED TOUCHDOWN POINT, WHERE THE ENVELOPE 
DRAPED OVER POWER LINES. HE SAID THE WIRE CONTACT TORE A VERTICAL RIP 
SEVERAL FEET LONG IN THE ENVELOPE. THE PILOT AND PASSENGER EXITED THE 
GONDOLA WITHOUT INJURY. 
INADEQUATE COMPENSATION FOR THE WIND CONDITIONS BY THE PILOT IN 
COMMAND.
