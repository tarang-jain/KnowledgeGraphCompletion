DURING FLIGHT, THE PILOT NOTED A DROP IN MANIFOLD PRESSURE AND DECIDED TO MAKE 
A PRECAUTIONARY LANDING. WHILE ON A BASE LEG TO LAND, HEAVY SMOKE AND 
FUMES FILLED THE CABIN AND REQUIRED THE PILOT TO LOOK OUT THE SIDE VENT 
WINDOW TO COMPLETE THE LANDING. AFTER THE AIRCRAFT STOPPED ON THE 
RUNWAY, A FIRE IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT WAS EXTINGUISHED. AN EXAM 
REVEALED THAT THE LEFT INTERMEDIATE EXHAUST PIPE (LYCOMING PART NO: 
LW-15811) HAD PARTIALLY SEPARATED AT THE FLANGE. THE ENGINE CROSSOVER 
EXHAUST ASSEMBLY HAD BEEN MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AD 89-12-04 AND 
TEXTRON LYCOMING SERVICE BULLETIN #484, WHICH WERE INTENDED TO 
PREVENT THIS KIND OF FAILURE/SEPARATION. 
IMPROPER INSTALLATION BY MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL AND FATIGUE FAILURE 
AND LEAKAGE OF THE LEFT INTERMEDIATE EXHAUST PIPE, WHICH RESULTED IN 
AN IN-FLIGHT FIRE IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 
WERE: INADEQUATE SERVICE BULLETIN PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER AND 
INSUFFICIENT STANDARDS PROVIDED BY THE (FAA) AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVE.
