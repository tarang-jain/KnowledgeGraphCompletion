WHILE EN ROUTE TO SANTA PAULA AIRPORT OVER A DESERT AREA, THE PILOT FELT 
A HOT OIL SPRAY EMANATING FROM BEHIND THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. HE 
ELECTED TO LAND IN AN OPEN FIELD. THE LANDING SITE SELECTED WAS NEAR 
HIGH TRANSMISSION WIRES, WHICH HE PROBABLY DID NOT SEE UNTIL THE 
AIRPLANE WAS ON FINAL APPROACH. THE PILOT PULLED THE AIRPLANE'S NOSE UP 
TO CROSS OVER THE TOP OF THE WIRES AND ALLOWED THE AIRSPEED TO RAPIDLY 
DECAY. THE AIRPLANE STALLED AND COLLIDED WITH THE TERRAIN. THE POST-
ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE OIL PRESSURE GAUGE LINE 'B' NUT HAD 
BACKED OFF. 
THE OIL GAUGE LINE 'B' NUT BACKED OFF, AND THE PILOT FAILED TO MAINTAIN 
AIRSPEED.
