DURING THE INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT, THE ENGINE SUFFERED A SUDDEN LOSS OF 
OIL PRESSURE, AND DURING THE FORCED LANDING, THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER 
TO THE INVERTED POSITION. AS THE OIL PRESSURE WAS DROPPING, SO WAS THE 
ENGINE RPM. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE OIL IN THE SYSTEM AFTER THE ACCIDENT 
AND THE OIL HAD BEEN BLOWING OUT THE ENGINE BREATHER SYSTEM. THE 
OPERATOR SAID THAT AFTER THE WRECKAGE HAD BEEN RECOVERED, THEY HAD 
BLOCKED OFF THE ENGINE BREATHER SYSTEM AND THEN HAD PRESSURIZED IT TO 
15 PSI, BUT COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING MECHANICAL THAT MIGHT HAVE 
PRESSURIZED THE CRANKCASE IN FLIGHT. 
UNKNOWN MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION RESULTING IN ENGINE OIL STARVATION. A 
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR WAS ROUGH TERRAIN IN WHICH THE FORCED LANDING 
WAS MADE.
