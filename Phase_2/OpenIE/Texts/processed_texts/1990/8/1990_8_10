THE PILOT STATED THAT WHILE HE WAS OPERATING THE HELICOPTER AT 100 FEET 
ABOVE THE GROUND IN AERIAL APPLICATION ACTIVITIES, THERE WAS A LOSS OF 
TAIL ROTOR CONTROL. THE HELICOPTER ENTERED A 'SLOW SPIN' AND DESCENDED 
INTO THE GROUND. POST-ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE TAIL 
ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT WAS 'SHEARED OFF' BETWEEN THE NUMBER 5 AND NUMBER 6 
BEARINGS. 
THE PILOT'S LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE HELICOPTER DUE TO THE FAILURE OF THE 
TAIL ROTOR DRIVE SHAFT.
