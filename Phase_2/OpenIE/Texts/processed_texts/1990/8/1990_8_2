THE PILOT STATED THE STARTER WOULD NO ROTATE THE ENGINE PAST THE FIRST 
POWER STROKE. HE DEPLANED AND THE PASSENGER STAYED ABOARD. THE PILOT 
STATED THAT THE MAG SWITCH, MASTER SWITCH, AND MIXTURE COUNTROL WERE 
IN THE 'OFF' POSITION. HE ALSO REPORTED THE THROTTLE WAS AT IDLE POSITION 
AND THE KEY WAS REMOVED FROM THE MAG SWITCH. THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO TURN 
THE ENGINE PAST THE COMPRESSION STROKE BY TURNING THE PROPELLER. AS HE 
ROTATED THE PROPELLER, THE ENGINE STARTED. THE PASSENGER STATED THAT 
WHEN THE ENGINE STARTED, SHE PANICKED AND PROBABLY ADVANCED THE 
THROTTLE. THE AIRCRAFT THEN BEGAN MOVING AND COLLIDED WITH TWO PARKED CARS. 
AN EXAM REVEALED THE IGNITION (MAG) KEY COULD BE REMOVED WITH THE MAG 
SWITCH IN ANY POSITION. 
FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO ASSURE THAT THE MAGNETO (IGNITION) SWITCH WAS IN 
THE PROPER POSITION.  A FACTOR RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WAS: PARTIAL 
FAILURE OF THE MAGNETO SWITCH, WHICH ALLOWED THE KEY TO BE REMOVED, 
THOUGH THE SWITCH WAS NOT IN THE 'OFF' POSITION.
