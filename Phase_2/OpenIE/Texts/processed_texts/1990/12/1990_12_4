THE AIRPLANE STRUCK A 30 FOOT HIGH UNMARKED POWERLINE ABOUT 20 FEET 
SHORT OF THE RUNWAY OF A PRIVATE GRASS AIRSTRIP. THE AIRPLANE CAME TO 
REST INVERTED ON THE RUNWAY.  THE INVESTIGATION DID NOT REVEAL EVIDENCE 
INDICATING THE PILOT HAD PREVIOUSLY LANDED AT THE AIRPORT.  THE 
EXAMINATION OF THE AIRPLANE DID NOT REVEAL EVIDENCE OF MECHANICAL 
MALFUNCTION. 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE CLEARANCE WITH AN OBSTACLE. 
CONTRIBUTING WAS AN UNMARKED POWERLINE AND THE PILOT'S LACK OF 
FAMILIARITY WITH THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA.
