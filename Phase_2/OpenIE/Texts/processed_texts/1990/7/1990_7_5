THE PILOTS OF TWO SIMILAR PA-38-112 AIRPLANES WERE FILED FOR SEPARATE VFR 
CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHTS. AFTER AN INTERMEDIATE STOPOVER AT AN AIRPORT 
AWAY FROM HOME BASE, THE TWO AIRPLANES JOINED UP AND BEGAN FLYING IN 
FORMATION. ACCORDING TO A WITNESS, THE TRAILING AIRPLANE (N2409K) 
COLLIDED WITH THE LEADING AIRPLANE (N2437K) FROM THE REAR WHILE 
MANEUVERING. IMPACT, PAINT AND RUBBER TRANSFER MARKS INDICATED THAT 
N2409K COLLIDED WITH N2437K FROM THE REAR, RIGHT SIDE. THE FLIGHT SCHOOL 
FROM WHICH THE PILOTS WERE ENROLLED EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FORMATION 
FLYING OF ANY TYPE. THE PIC'S OF EACH AIRPLANE HAD LOGGED ABOUT 118 HOURS 
EACH PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT, AND HAD RECEIVED THEIR PILOT CERTIFICATES 
THE MONTH PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. THE PILOTS AND PILOT RATED PASSENGERS 
WERE ALL SPANISH CITIZENS. 
FAILURE OF THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND OF N2409K TO MAINTAIN SAFE SEPARATION 
FROM N2437K DURING UNAUTHORIZED FORMATION MANEUVERING.  
OVERCONFIDENCE IN PERSONAL ABILITY AND THE EXECUTION OF UNAUTHORIZED 
FORMATION FLIGHT ON THE PART OF BOTH PILOTS-IN-COMMAND WERE FACTORS 
IN THE ACCIDENT.  THE LACK OF TOTAL EXPERIENCE OF BOTH PILOTS-IN-
COMMAND WAS ALSO A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT.
