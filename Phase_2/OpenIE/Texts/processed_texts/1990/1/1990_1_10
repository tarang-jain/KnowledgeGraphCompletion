THE STUDENT PILOT RECEIVED TWO WEATHER BRIEFINGS DURING WHICH HE WAS 
TOLD AT FIRST THAT HIS ROUTE OF FLIGHT WAS MARGINAL VFR AND LATER THAT 
IT HAD GONE IFR. IN BOTH CASES, HE WAS TOLD THAT VFR WAS NOT 
RECOMMENDED. IN A POST-ACCIDENT INTERVIEW THE PILOT STATED THAT 
MARGINAL WEATHER DID NOT BOTHER HIM AND THAT HE KNEW 'HOW TO FLY IN 
THE CLOUDS'. ABOUT 2:10 AFTER DEPARTURE, THE PILOT CONTACTED NEW 
ORLEANS APPROACH CONTROL AND REQUESTED ASSISTANCE IN GETTING TO HIS 
DESTINATION AIRPORT. HE WAS TOLD THAT ALL OF THE AIRPORTS IN THE AREA 
WERE IFR. DURING THE NEXT 1:38 CONTROLLER ATTEMPTED TO VECTOR THE PILOT 
TO AIRPORTS IN THE AREA IN ATTEMPTS TO GET THE AIRPLANE DOWN. ANOTHER 
AIRPLANE ASSISTED IN THESE EFFORTS, BUT IN EACH CASE, THE PILOT WAS 
UNABLE TO LOCATE THE AIRPORTS DUE TO THE THICK UNDERCAST CONDITIONS. 
WHILE BEING VECTORED FOR AN ILS, THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HIS ENGINE QUIT 
DUE TO FUEL EXHAUSTION. HE WAS UNABLE TO GLIDE TO THE AIRPORT AND 
CRASHED INTO TREES ABOUT 8 MILES SHORT. 
PILOT IN COMMAND'S INITIATION AND CONTINUATION OF THE FLIGHT INTO AN 
AREA OF KNOWN IMC WEATHER CONDITIONS AND HIS SUBSEQUENT INABILITY TO 
LAND PRIOR TO RUNNING OUT OF FUEL. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE 
ACCIDENT WERE THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO EXERCISE GOOD JUDGEMENT AND HIS 
DISREGARD FOR THE FEDERAL AIR REGULATIONS.
