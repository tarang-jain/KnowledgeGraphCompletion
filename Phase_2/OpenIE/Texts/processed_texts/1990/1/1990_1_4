A STUDENT PILOT HAD COMPLETED HIS SOLO AIR WORK AND WAS ATTEMPTING TO 
RETURN TO HIS HOME AIRFIELD. AFTER PROCEEDING ON THE HEADING FROM THE 
PRACTICE AREA TO THE AIRFIELD FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES, HE BECAME 
CONCERNED, AND HEADED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. HE RECOGNIZED HE WAS 
LOST. COMMUNICATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED WITH APPROACH CONTROL 
THROUGH ANOTHER AIRPLANE FROM THE SAME OPERATOR. A HEADING WAS 
PROVIDED TO HOME BASE. WHEN HE REPORTED OVER ANOTHER AIRPORT HE WAS 
INSTRUCTED TO LAND BY THE OPERATOR. DURING THE LANDING FLARE THE 
STUDENT LOST DIRECTIONAL CONTRO, ATTEMPTED A GO AROUND, OVER RAN THE 
RUNWAY, AND HIT A CANAL. 
THE STUDENT PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT AIRSPEED THROUGH THE 
LANDING FLARE TO AVOID A LOSS OF DIRECTIONAL CONTROL. CONTRIBUTING TO 
THE ACCIDENT WAS HIS FAILURE TO ANTICIPATE CONTROL INPUTS REQUIRED BY 
INCREASED THRUST DURING THE GO AROUND.
