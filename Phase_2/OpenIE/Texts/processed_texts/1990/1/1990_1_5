THE PURPOSE OF THE FLIGHT WAS TO CHECK THE PERFORMANCE OF THE NEWLY 
INSTALLED/OVERHAULED ENGINE. BEFORE TAKEOFF, THE ENGINE WAS RUN FOR 
ABOUT AN HOUR AND NO PROBLEMS WERE FOUND. THE PILOT AND THE 
MECHANIC/PASSENGER REPORTED THAT DURING THE INITIAL CLIMB AFTER 
TAKEOFF, THE FUEL PRESSURE DROPPED AND THE ENGINE LOST POWER. 
SUBSEQUENTLY, THE AIRCRAFT WAS DAMAGED DURING AN EMERGENCY LANDING IN A 
FIELD. REPORTEDLY, THE PILOT DID NOT CHANGE THE POSITION OF THE FUEL 
SELECTOR AFTER THE ENGINE LOST POWER. A POST ACCIDENT EXAMINATION AND 
OPERATIONAL CHECK OF THE ENGINE REVEALED NO FUEL CONTAMINATION OR 
MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION. DURING THE CHECK, THE FUEL SELECTOR WAS 
MOVED TO THE OFF POSITION WHILE THE ENGINE WAS RUNNING AND THE ENGINE 
POWER WAS LOST ABOUT 15 SECONDS LATER. 
FUEL STARVATION AND IMPROPER USE OF EMERGENCY PROCEDURES (FUEL 
SELECTOR) BY THE PILOT.
