THE PILOT STATED THAT AFTER A LOCAL AREA FLIGHT. HE AND THE  PASSENGER, 
WHO WAS A STUDENT PILOT, RETURNED TO THE DEPARTURE AIRPORT. THE PILOT 
ESTIMATED THAT THE RUNWAY WAS PLOWED TO A USABLE WIDTH OF ABOUT 25 
FEET AND WAS ICY. HE DESCRIBED THE APPROACH AND TOUCHDOWN AS NORMAL AND 
SMOOTH. DURING THE LANDING ROLL, THE AIRCRAFT 'SLID TO THE RIGHT,' 
ENCOUNTERED A CRUSTY SNOWBANK AND NOSED OVER. NEITHER OF THE PILOTS 
HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH WINTER FLIGHT OPERATIONS. THE PILOT STATED 
THAT, GIVEN 'HOW BAD THE RUNWAY WAS...' HE SHOULD NOT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO 
LAND ON IT. 
FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT,  
WHICH RESULTED IN HIS FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PROPER RUNWAY ALIGNMENT.  
FACTORS RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE THE PILOT'S LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN 
WINTER OPERATIONS, THE ICY RUNWAY CONDITION, AND THE SNOWBANK.
