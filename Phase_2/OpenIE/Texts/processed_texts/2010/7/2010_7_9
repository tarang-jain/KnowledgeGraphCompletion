While on a cross country flight the pilot recognized that he had been using the wrong road to 
navigate to his destination. He decided to turn around and return to the departure airport. The 
pilot reported that he was concerned with the approaching night and decreasing light 
condition. As the amount of light continued to decrease he elected to make a precautionary 
landing on a road prior to reaching the departure airport. The pilot stated that either during 
the landing or taxi the underside of the wing was damaged by contact with a road marker. 
Further damage to the wing caused by contacting additional road markers occurred when the 
pilot taxied off the road to park the airplane and again when repositioning the airplane. The 
pilot reported that there were no known mechanical malfunctions or failures with the aircraft 
prior to the accident.
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from road signs during landing.
