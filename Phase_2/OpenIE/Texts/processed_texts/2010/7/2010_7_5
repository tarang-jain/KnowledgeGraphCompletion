The certified flight instructor (CFI) and private pilot student were conducting tailwheel 
certification training.  During the third flight of the day, after practicing 3-point landings, the 
student pilot was performing an additional 3-point landing after having just practiced main 
wheel landings.  The CFI described the pattern and approach as being normal.  During the roll 
out and while slowing the airplane down, it began to drift left.  The CFI called for right rudder 
and the airplane began drifting right of centerline.  After calling for left rudder the CFI 
attempted to regain control using rudder and power.  The airplane entered a violent turn to the 
left, exited the runway, and flipped over going down an embankment.  The right wing spar and 
horizontal stabilizer were bent.
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control and the certified flight instructor's 
delay in remedial action.
