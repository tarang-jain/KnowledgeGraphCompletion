The pilot reported that he was low on the final approach to runway 32 at the mountaintop 
airport, but thought he could "make the numbers." The airplane encountered a downdraft, and 
the pilot wasn't able to compensate for it. The airplane impacted terrain about 3 feet short of 
the runway, bounced, then veered off the right side of the runway and struck an embankment, 
resulting in substantial damage to the right wing and fuselage. The pilot also stated that there 
was a 7-knot tailwind "from the right," and that the density altitude was about 6,300 feet at the 
time of the accident. The flight was the pilotâ„¢s seventh arrival into the airport, and his first time 
landing there with a tailwind. There were no preaccident mechanical anomalies noted with the 
airplane, which "was performing great." According to the airport's pilot manual, runway 32 was 
the preferred landing runway due to its upslope and fewer obstructions at the arrival end. 
There was no displaced threshold, and the terrain rose sharply to the approach end of the 
runway. A visual glideslope indicator was located to the left of the runway. The pilot's manual 
also advised, "consider flying a steeper approach to compensate for the 'burble' downdraft 
typically present at the end of the runway," and noted that the hills on either side and the 
runway's upslope "will combine to produce the optical illusion of being too steep an approach 
path." The manual further stated, "consider carefully the effects of density altitude on the 
performance of your aircraft," as well as, "many pilots will not consider landing with SSE 
winds, and will simply divert" to another airport.
