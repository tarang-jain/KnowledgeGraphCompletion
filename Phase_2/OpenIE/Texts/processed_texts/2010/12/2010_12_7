The airplane was being operated as a training airplane in a university aviation program when 
substantial damage, consistent with a hard landing, was discovered during a maintenance 
inspection. The lower portion of the engine firewall, nose landing gear/firewall doubler, and 
floor pans near fuselage station 30 were damaged. There were no other mechanical anomalies 
noted that would have precluded normal aircraft operation. The time of the accident and the 
identification of the pilot(s) are unknown.
A hard landing for undetermined reasons.
