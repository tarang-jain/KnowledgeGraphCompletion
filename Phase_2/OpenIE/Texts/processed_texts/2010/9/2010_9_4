The pilot stated that the takeoff was normal until the airplane was about 50 feet above the 
ground, at which time he closed the carburetor heat and the engine lost power. The airplane™s 
landing gear then contacted top of a security fence beyond the end of the runway and the 
airplane bounced into a plowed field in a nose-down attitude. The pilot further stated that 
before he exited the airplane, he checked the fuel valve and found that it was not locked in the 
full forward position; rather, it was midway between the "ON" and "OFF" positions. The pilot 
said that in retrospect, he was not positive that he had placed the fuel valve in the "ON" 
position during his preflight inspection, and that this was the reason for the engine losing 
power on takeoff.
The pilot™s failure to ensure that the fuel valve was in the "ON" position during his preflight 
inspection, resulting in the loss of engine power during takeoff.
