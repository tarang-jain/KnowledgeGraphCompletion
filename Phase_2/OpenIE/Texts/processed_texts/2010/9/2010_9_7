The pilot stated that he taxied to the runway for the purpose of performing a high speed taxi 
run. After an engine run-up, he latched the two canopy latches on the right side and scanned 
the instrument panel, noticing that the cylinder head temperature and oil temperature were 
rising. He stated that his attention was diverted in concern of the rising temperature and did 
not recall if he latched the two latches on the left side of the canopy. He started the takeoff roll 
and after becoming airborne, he noticed the canopy opening on the left side. The pilot 
attempted to latch the canopy, but realized it would take both hands, and continued to climb to 
pattern altitude while trimming the aircraft for better airspeed control. He then pulled the 
throttle back to slow the airspeed and attempted to latch the canopy. The canopy started 
flapping up and down, and when he tried to secure it shut with his hands he was not be able to 
control the airplane. He stated that debris was flying everywhere and the wind blew off his 
headset. When he realized that he was getting low he added full engine power and looked for a 
clear area; shortly thereafter the airplane collided with the ground.
The pilotâ„¢s failure to properly latch the cockpit canopy prior to takeoff, resulting in his diverted 
attention and failure to maintain aircraft control.
