The pilot reported that he departed on a cross-country flight with 49 gallons of fuel on-board 
the airplane. About 3 hours later, as he approached his destination airport, the airplane™s 
engine surged followed by a total loss of power. The pilot suspected that the engine had 
experienced vapor lock/fuel blockage and attempted to resolve the problem by selecting each of 
the airplane™s three fuel tanks and affirming that the mixture control was in the full rich 
position. The airplane continued to descend and the pilot elected to conduct a forced landing at 
his destination airport. The airplane did not have sufficient altitude and the pilot made a hard 
landing diagonally across the runway. During the landing, the airplane™s nose gear collapsed 
and the right wing was substantially damaged. A Federal Aviation Administration inspector 
examined the airplane on-site and reported that it appeared the underside of the fuselage had 
blue stains on it akin to the coloration of fuel; he noted that the fuel caps had duct tape on 
them. The inspector was unable to determine if the airplane™s fuel tanks contained fuel. The 
reason for the loss of engine power was not determined.
The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.
