The private pilot was on a personal cross-country flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91. He said he 
had arrived at an abandoned gravel airstrip, and was making a low pass to assess wind and 
runway conditions for landing. He said while making a pass 12-15 feet above the ground, he 
decided the conditions were not right for landing due to a crosswind. He reported that as he 
applied power to terminate the low pass, a gust of wind from the right rolled the airplane to the 
left, and the left wing struck the ground. The pilot said despite full rudder, aileron, and power, 
he was unable to overcome the roll. The pilot said there were no mechanical problems with the 
airplane prior to the accident, and that the wings and fuselage sustained substantial damage 
during the accident. The pilot said he had not realized how the topography around the strip 
influenced the crosswind, and how fast the weather conditions were changing.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control while maneuvering at a low altitude.
