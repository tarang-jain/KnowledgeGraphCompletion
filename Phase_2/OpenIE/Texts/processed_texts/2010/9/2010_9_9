The pilot reported that during landing he noticed the wind intensity was increasing at the 
private airstrip. He departed again for his fifth aerial application flight of the day. While on the 
takeoff, as the tail was lifting off the ground, a gust of wind struck the airplane and it veered 
towards the right. The airplane exited the runway surface and struck a power pole, 
substantially damaging the wings, fuselage and empennage. The nearest weather reporting 
station, located about 13 miles from the accident airstrip, reported wind at 13 knots gusting to 
19 knots. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine.
The pilotâ„¢s inadequate compensation for the wind and failure to maintain directional control 
during the takeoff roll.
