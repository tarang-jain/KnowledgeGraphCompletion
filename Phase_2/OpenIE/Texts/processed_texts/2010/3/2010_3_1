The pilot of the single-engine turboprop was on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight and 
cancelled his IFR flight plan after being cleared for a visual approach to the destination airport. 
He flew a left traffic pattern for runway 32, a 4,202-foot-long, 75-foot-wide, asphalt runway. 
The pilot reported that the airplane crossed the runway threshold at 81 knots and touched 
down normally, with the stall warning horn sounding. The airplane subsequently drifted left 
and the pilot attempted to correct with right rudder input; however, the airplane continued to 
drift to the left side of the runway. The pilot then initiated a go-around and cognizant of risk of 
torque roll at low speeds did not apply full power. The airplane climbed to about 10 feet above 
the ground. At that time, the airplane was in a 20-degree left bank and the pilot applied full 
right aileron input to correct. The airplane then descended in a left turn, the pilot retarded the 
throttle, and braced for impact. A Federal Aviation Administration inspector reported that the 
airplane traveled about 100 feet off the left side of the runway, nosed down in mud, and came 
to rest in trees. Examination of the wreckage by the inspector did not reveal any preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions, nor did the pilot report any. The reported wind, about the time of the 
accident, was from 310 degrees at 10 knots, gusting to 15 knots.
