According to the certified flight instructor, the student pilot was on approach for landing to 
runway 10 left. Prior to touchdown the student pilot pulled excessive back pressure on the 
elevator flight control and the airplane ballooned before touching down hard on the main 
landing gear. The flight instructor then took over the flight controls, made a go-around, and 
landed on another runway. The airplane received substantial damage to the rudder torque 
tube.
The student pilot's improper flare and the flight instructor's delayed remedial action, resulting 
in a hard landing.
