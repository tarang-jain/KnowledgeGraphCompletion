The pilot was returning to the departure airport after having flown for approximately two 
hours at various cruise altitudes. The pilot attempted a landing on runway 30 (2,394 feet by 48 
feet), which was slush-covered. During the landing rollout, the airplane "swerved hard right" 
and into a snowbank, where it nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage, which 
included damage to the wing ribs, wing trailing edge, and rudder. A weather reporting station 
about 9 miles from the accident site recorded variable winds at 4 knots at the time of the 
accident. Examination of the airplane revealed that the brake pin lubrication had dried out and 
the right brake caliper would not release.
The pilot's inability to maintain directional control while landing on a slush-covered runway 
due to inadequate maintenance of the airplane brakes by maintenance personnel.
