The pilot reported that the airspeed indicator was not displaying normal values as the airplane 
accelerated on the takeoff roll.  After identifying the airspeed indicator anomaly, she continued 
the takeoff roll for an unspecified distance before ultimately deciding to abort the takeoff.  The 
pilot noted that there was an accumulation of dew on the grass runway.  During the rejected 
takeoff, the airplane overran the end of the runway and slid down an embankment before 
nosing-over in a ravine.  Both wings were substantially damaged during the accident.  A 
postaccident inspection revealed that the pilot had not removed the pitot-tube protective cover 
before departure.
