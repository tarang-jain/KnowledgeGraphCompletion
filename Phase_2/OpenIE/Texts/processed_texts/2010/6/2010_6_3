The pilot reported that she was practicing touch-and-go landings when the accident occurred.  
During her first touch-and-go, the airplane bounced after a hard landing.  She attempted to 
correct for the bounced landing, but the airplaneâ„¢s nose landing gear impacted the runway 
before the main landing gear.  The airplane stabilized onto all three landing gear and she 
proceeded with the next takeoff.  No anomalies were experienced with the two subsequent 
landings.  A postflight inspection of the airframe revealed substantial damage to the engine 
firewall and fuselage floor structure.  The pilot reported that there were no preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the 
airplane.
The pilot's improper landing flare and recovery from a bounced landing.
