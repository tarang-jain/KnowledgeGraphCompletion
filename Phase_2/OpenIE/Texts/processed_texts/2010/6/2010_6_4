Following a practice instrument approach, the student pilot and flight instructor intended to 
perform a touch-and-go maneuver. During the landing roll the instructor informed the student 
to retract the airplane™s flaps; however, the student inadvertently moved the landing gear 
retraction/extension handle to the ﬁupﬂ position. Although the instructor moved the landing 
gear handle back to the ﬁdownﬂ position, the airplane™s nose landing gear collapsed. The 
airplane continued down the runway about 240 feet before exiting the right side of the runway 
into the grass. The airplane came to rest in a nose-down position and all three occupants were 
able to exit unassisted. An examination of the airplane by maintenance personnel after the 
accident revealed that the right wing sustained structural damage. There were no reported 
anomalies with the airplane™s landing gear prior to the accident.
The student pilot™s inadvertent retraction of the nose landing gear and the flight instructor's 
delayed response.
