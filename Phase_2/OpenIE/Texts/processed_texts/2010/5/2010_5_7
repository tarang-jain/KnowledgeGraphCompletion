The private pilot reported that he was landing the tail wheel-equipped airplane at a privately-
owned grass airstrip with a "slight" crosswind. He reported that after touchdown, during the 
landing roll, he lost directional control of the airplane and it collided with an unoccupied 
parked vehicle adjacent to the runway. The collision resulted in substantial damage to the right 
wing. No mechanical deficiencies or anomalies with the airplane were reported.
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the crosswind conditions resulting in the loss of 
directional control while landing.
