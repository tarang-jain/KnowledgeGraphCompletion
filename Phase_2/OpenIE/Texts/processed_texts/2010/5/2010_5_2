According to the pilot, while landing following a cross-country flight the airplane touched 
down and began to bounce. The pilot attempted to recover, but the airplane bounced twice and, 
when the pilot felt that the airplane was about to stall, he initiated a missed approach. The pilot 
then flew the traffic pattern and landed again uneventfully. The pilot stated that, while taxiing 
to the parking ramp, he could not steer the airplane and that the ground guide observed that 
the nose landing gear tire was flat. An inspection of the airplane performed by a Federal 
Aviation Administration inspector revealed substantial damage to the lower firewall. The pilot 
reported that there were no mechanical problems with the airplane. A weather observation 
taken about the time of the accident recorded the wind as from 260 degrees at 12 knots, 
gusting to 16 knots.
