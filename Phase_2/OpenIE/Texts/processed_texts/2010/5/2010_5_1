The private pilot, with one passenger, was on a Title 14, CFR Part 91, personal flight when the 
accident occurred. The purpose of the flight was to search for a missing friend in an area of 
remote tree and snow-covered terrain. The pilot said that while flying slow and maneuvering at 
75-feet above the ground, his passenger saw the missing man lying on the ground near a snow-
covered meadow. The pilot reported that as he started a right turn back to the meadow, he 
added engine power, and initiated a climb, but the right wing stalled. He said that he initiated a 
stall recovery, but that the airplane descended nose down into the trees. The pilot said that 
there were no mechanical problems with the airplane prior to the accident. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage.
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed while maneuvering, which resulted in an 
aerodynamic stall.
