The certified flight instructor (CFI) and student pilot were performing a short field landing in 
the multi-engine airplane. The CFI reported that the student pilot was at the controls, and 
performing a stable landing approach. During the landing flare the airplane banked 30 degrees 
to the right and the CFI attempted to apply corrective control inputs. He stated that the 
airspeed, altitude, and bank angle prevented him from performing a go-around. The airplane 
landed, departed the runway, and came to rest beyond a parallel taxiway. Post accident 
examination revealed damage to the right aileron, and creases in the upper wing skins, 
adjacent to the right engine. The CFI stated that there were no mechanical malfunctions of 
failures of the airplane, and that gusting left crosswinds existed at the time of the accident.
The student pilot's inadequate compensation for the gusting crosswind conditions and the 
certified flight instructor's inadequate supervision, resulting in a loss of directional control 
during landing.
