The certificated flight instructor (CFI) and student had been practicing touch-and-go landings 
and were planning a full-stop landing. The airplane touched down on the grass airstrip slightly 
faster than normal and approximately 100 feet beyond the approach end of the runway. The 
CFI took authority of the airplane's controls and applied brakes. As the airplane approached 
the end of the runway, the CFI applied left rudder to avoid a ditch in front of the airplane. 
Subsequently, the right main landing gear went into the ditch and the airplane flipped over. 
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the vertical stabilizer and rudder were 
bent. The CFI reported that there were no preimpact mechanical anomalies with the airplane. 
He further stated that they should have landed on the adjacent asphalt runway or performed a 
go-around after overshooting the final approach leg during the landing.
The student pilot's failure to maintain proper airspeed during the landing and certificated 
flight instructor's failure to execute a go-around.
