Just after the airplane lifted off the runway surface during the night takeoff, the pilot observed 
two deer crossing the runway from left to right. He stated that one deer was in front of him and 
the other was to the left of his path. He pulled back on the yoke in an attempt to avoid the deer 
at which time he heard a loud "bang." The pilot reported that he missed the deer that he 
observed and contacted a third deer that he did not see. The pilot continued the flight to his 
destination where he made an uneventful landing. The injured deer was located at the 
departure airport. The right horizontal stabilizer and elevator sustained substantial damage.
