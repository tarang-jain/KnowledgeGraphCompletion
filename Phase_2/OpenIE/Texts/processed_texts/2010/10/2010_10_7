According to the pilot, he was back taxiing on the runway when the tailwind and runway slope 
allowed the airplane to gain more than normal taxi speed. As the pilot realized the airplane was

the rudder. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical malfunctions 
that would have precluded normal operation.
