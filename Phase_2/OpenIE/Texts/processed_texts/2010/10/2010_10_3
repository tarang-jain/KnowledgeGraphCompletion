The pilot reported that the flight was normal and he maneuvered the multi-engine airplane 
onto the final approach leg of the traffic pattern. The airplane yawed slightly to the right and 
the pilot attempted a go-around at about 100 feet above ground level. He noted that there was 
a lack of engine power from the right engine. The pilot arrested the descent with power from 
the left engine, but the airplane impacted terrain adjacent to the runway. A postaccident 
examination of the right engine was limited to verifying engine compression, which was 
confirmed to be normal.
The failure by the pilot to attain/maintain a climb rate for undetermined reasons during a go-
around.
