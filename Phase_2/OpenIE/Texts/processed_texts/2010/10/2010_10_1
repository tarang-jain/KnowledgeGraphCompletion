The pilot reported that he was landing the tailwheel-equipped airplane on a gravel-covered 
runway in a left crosswind. He stated that during touchdown he used insufficient rudder and 
the airplane veered to the left. He added power to correct the situation and abort the landing, 
but the airplane's right wing contacted trees and it pivoted to the right. The airplane continued 
to track right, exited the gravel runway, and came to rest at the base of an embankment. The 
airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing assembly and empennage. The pilot 
noted that there were no preimpact mechanical anomalies with the airplane.
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the wind conditions during landing, which resulted in 
a loss of directional control and collision with trees.
