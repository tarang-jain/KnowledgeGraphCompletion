The pilot reported that after takeoff, about 250 feet above ground level (agl), the engine 
experienced a total loss of power. He reduced the throttle to idle and attempted to land on the 
runway; however, there was not enough distance remaining. He subsequently pushed the 
throttle forward and the engine regained power. As the airplane reached approximately 250 
feet agl, the engine lost power again. The pilot subsequently set up for a forced landing to a 
harvested corn field immediately west of the airport. The airplane nosed over during the 
emergency landing. A postaccident examination of the engine revealed no anomalies consistent 
with a preimpact failure or malfunction.  
The total loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.
