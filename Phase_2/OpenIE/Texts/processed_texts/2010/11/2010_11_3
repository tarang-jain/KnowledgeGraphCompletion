The pilot reported that shortly after takeoff, he turned to his intended heading and climbed to a 
predetermined cruise altitude to maintain clearance from terrain during the night visual flight 
rules cross-country flight.  Following an uneventful cruise phase of the flight, the pilot observed 
what he believed to be his destination airport and initiated a descent.  The pilot stated that he 
was unable to turn on the airport runway lights and decided to continue the descent to the 
airport's traffic pattern altitude of 4,500 feet mean sea level (msl) while circling the airport.  
During the second circle and descent, the pilot aborted the descent and began to initiate a 
climb whereupon the airplane impacted terrain at an elevation of about 5,200 feet msl.  The 
pilot reported that he was surprised when local law enforcement informed him that he was in 
Seligman, Arizona, instead of his intended destination of Boulder City, Nevada.  The pilot 
reported that there were no pre-impact anomalies with the airplane that would have 
contributed to the accident and that "all systems were working."  The pilot added that prior to 
the flight; he estimated an approximate heading and altitude needed for the flight to his 
destination airport.
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from terrain while maneuvering.  Contributing to the 
accident was the pilot's inadequate preflight and in-flight planning.
