The pilot, who was flying the second airplane in a flight of two, was maneuvering in the traffic 
pattern at a remote back-country airstrip. The approach to the airstrip required the pilots to 
make a precise base leg to final turn between two steep rock cliffs. During the accident pilot's 
turn to final approach, he inadvertently made too wide of a turn, resulting in the airplane's 
nose and right main landing gear colliding with the cliff and becoming separated from the 
airframe. After the pilot in the other airplane confirmed the extent of the damage, the pilot 
flying the accident airplane maneuvered to a town where emergency personnel could be 
available on the ground. Due to the damage, the pilot decided to land in the grass/turf area 
alongside the main runway. During the landing roll, the nose gear strut dug into the soft terrain 
and the airplane nosed over onto its back.
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from terrain during a turn onto the final approach leg
