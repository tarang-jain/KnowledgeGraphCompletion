pilot took his hand off the collective to adjust the sun visor because the sun was in his eyes. The 
pilot reported that he had used his leg to block the collective from moving as he adjusted the 
visor. The helicopter hit mild turbulence and bumped his leg away from the collective. The 
collective slipped down, and the helicopter impacted the ground and rolled over on its side. 
The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the tailboom and cockpit.  The pilot stated that 
there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the helicopter's flight control system or 
engine prior to the accident.
