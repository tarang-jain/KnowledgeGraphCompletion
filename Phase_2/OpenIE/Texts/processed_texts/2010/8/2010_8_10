The pilot noted a partial loss of engine power in the float-equipped airplane. His corrective 
actions did not restore full engine power and the airplane was unable to maintain altitude. He 
reduced engine power to flight idle and entered a rapid descent to a nearby lake. He noted that 
the engine continued to operate while in the flight idle position. Due to the size constraints of 
the lake, the landing was firm and that the airplane nosed over shortly after touchdown.  The 
fuselage primary structure, left horizontal stabilizer, right float and support structure, and left 
wing spar were substantially damaged during the accident.  A postaccident examination 
confirmed flight control continuity between the cockpit controls and the individual flight 
control surfaces.  Fuel system continuity was established between the fuel control and 
carburetor.  The examination did not reveal any evidence of a mechanical malfunction.
A partial loss of engine power for undetermined reasons and the pilot's failure to adequately 
flare during the water landing.
