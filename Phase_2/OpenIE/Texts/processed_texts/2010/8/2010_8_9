The pilot stated that tailwheel-equipped airplane was accelerating on the takeoff roll when the 
tail became airborne before rotation speed, which was immediately followed by a left 
yaw/swerve. He attempted to regain directional control with right rudder and brake inputs, but 
the airplane continued in the left swerve. He elected to abort the takeoff by reducing engine 
power to idle while continuing to apply right rudder and brake inputs. He used aggressive 
braking as the airplane approached the left edge of the runway, but the airplane continued off 
the runway and struck several trees. He noted that the turf-runway was dew covered and that 
the wind was at approximately 3 knots, with no gusts. The leading edge of both wings, vertical 
stabilizer, and rudder were substantially damaged during the accident. A postaccident 
inspection of the airplane did not reveal any mechanical malfunction of the tailwheel or 
braking systems.
