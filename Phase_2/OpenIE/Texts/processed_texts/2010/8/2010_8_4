According to the pilot, he performed a run-up and proceeded to the departure end of the 
runway. He applied full power and began the takeoff roll. With the airplane about halfway 
down the runway, the pilot realized that the airplane was not developing as much airspeed as 
he expected. As the airplane approached the end of the runway, he decided to abort the takeoff. 
He pulled back the throttle and applied the brakes but the airplane did not slow down quickly 
enough. The airplane ran off the end of the runway, traveled down an embankment, and came 
to rest in a marshy area, substantially damaging the forward section of the fuselage. The pilot 
noted that he had forgotten to set the flaps properly for takeoff. During a postaccident 
examination of the wreckage, a Federal Aviation Administration inspector found no preexisting 
mechanical anomalies with the airplane. 
The pilotâ„¢s delayed decision to abort the takeoff.
