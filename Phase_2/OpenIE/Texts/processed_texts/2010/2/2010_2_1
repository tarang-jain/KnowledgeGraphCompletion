to continue the takeoff roll and return to the airport; during the downwind leg, the smoke 
became severe. The pilot was able to land the airplane safely. Examination of the airplane 
revealed that the engine, cowling, and firewall sustained fire damage. Additionally the 
inspection revealed that a fuel injector/line on the No. 5 cylinder was broken and had sprayed 
fuel onto the engine's turbocharger.
