The pilot reported that the airplane encountered a downdraft after completing an aerial 
application pass. While climbing away from the field, the airplaneâ„¢s right wing impacted a tree 
and the pilot performed an off-field landing instead of returning to the departure airport. The 
main landing gear collapsed during the landing in a rough field. A postimpact fire ensued on 
the right wing after the airplane came to rest. The airplane was substantially damaged. The 
pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would 
have precluded normal operation of the airplane.
