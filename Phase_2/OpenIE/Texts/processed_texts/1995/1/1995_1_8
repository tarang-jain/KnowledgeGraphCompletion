THE PILOT SAID HE WAS ON FINAL APPROACH TO A COUNTY DIRT ROAD HE 
INTENDED TO USE AS A RUNWAY WHEN THE ENGINE FALTERED AT 75-100 FEET AGL. 
THE RPM'S FELL FROM 1800 RPM TO BELOW 1000 RPM. HE SAID HE HAD PLANNED 
HIS GLIDEPATH TO MISS A TREE ON THE ROADWAY SHOULDER. THE ENGINE 
WOULD NOT RESPOND TO THROTTLE ADVANCEMENT, SO THE PILOT ELECTED TO 
LAND SHORT ON THE ROADWAY. THE PILOT TURNED THE AIRCRAFT TO THE LEFT 
TO MISS THE TREE, AND THE LEFT MAIN GEAR SLIPPED OFF THE ROAD AND INTO 
SOFT SOIL. THE ENGINE THEN RESPONDED TO THROTTLE APPLICATION AND THE 
PILOT ATTEMPTED TO STEER THE AIRCRAFT BACK ONTO THE CENTER OF THE ROAD. 
ACCUMULATED SOFT DIRT IN FRONT OF THE MAIN GEAR PULLED THE NOSE GEAR 
OFF THE ROAD AND INTO SOFT DIRT, WHICH CAUSED THE AIRCRAFT TO NOSE OVER. 
POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE AIRCRAFT BY FAA INSPECTORS REVEALED NO 
DISCREPANCIES WITH THE AIRFRAME OR ENGINE. 
the failure of the pilot to maintain directional control of the aircraft while on the rollout phase 
of landing on a dirt road.  A factor in the accident was the pilot's intentional selection of the 
road as a landing site. 
 On January 2, 1995, at 0940 Pacific standard time, a Cessna 175, N7098M, nosed over after 
encountering soft soil while landing on a county road near Davis, California.  The aircraft was 
owned and operated by the pilot.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and 
no flight plan was filed for the operation.  The aircraft incurred substantial damage.  The 
certificated private pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured.  The flight originated at the Yolo 
County Airport, Davis, California, at 0920 as a personal flight to a ranch near the road used for 
the landing.
The pilot stated in the Pilot/Operator written report that while on final to land on the roadway, 
he observed his sink rate to be faster than desired.  To correct the situation, he advanced the 
throttle to increase his glidepath in order to touchdown beyond a tree at the side of the road.  
The pilot said that about 75-100 feet agl, the "engine faltered and rpm fell off to below 1,000 
rpm."  The engine did not respond to his throttle adjustment, so he selected to land short.
After touchdown, the pilot steered the aircraft to the left to avoid the wing striking a tree.  The 
left main landing gear was running parallel to the north edge of the road when it slipped off the 
road surface and into the soft-dirt shoulder.  The pilot continued to rollout parallel to the road 
while he attempted to apply power along with right rudder, in an attempt to move the aircraft 
back onto the road surface.  About the time the engine responded to the throttle advancement, 
soft dirt had accumulated in front of the main gear, and this pulled the nose gear into the soft 
shoulder.  The pilot then pulled power off and attempted to slow the aircraft with the right toe 
brake.  The aircraft rolled into freshly tilled soil and nosed over.
A FAA inspector from the Sacramento Flight Standards District Office examined the aircraft 
and found no discrepancies with the airframe or engine.
