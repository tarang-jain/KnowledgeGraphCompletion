THE PILOT OBTAINED A WEATHER BRIEFING, FILED AN IFR FLIGHT PLAN, AND TOOK 
OFF AT NIGHT ON A FLIGHT FROM HOT SPRINGS, ARKANSAS, TO PUEBLO, 
COLORADO. ABOUT ONE MINUTE LATER, HE ADVISED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL THAT 
HE NEEDED TO RETURN TO HOT SPRINGS. HE THEN CONTACTED THE AIRPLANE 
OPERATOR AND SAID THE HEATER WAS NOT WORKING. THE OPERATOR SUGGESTED 
THAT HE RETURN FOR REPAIRS. THE PILOT WAS THEN HEARD TO SAY, 'OH, SHOOT!'  
NO FURTHER RADIO TRANSMISSIONS WERE RECEIVED FROM THE FLIGHT. THE 
AIRPLANE CUT A 400 FOOT SWATH THROUGH TREES, AND THE WRECKAGE PATH 
MEASURED 940 FEET. WITH EXCEPTION OF A HEATER PROBLEM, NO PREIMPACT 
MECHANICAL FAILURE WAS EVIDENT. 
THE PILOT INADVERTENTLY ALLOWED THE AIRPLANE TO DESCEND AND COLLIDE 
WITH TREES, AFTER HE BECAME DIVERTED BY AN INOPERATIVE CABIN HEATER.  
DARKNESS WAS A RELATED FACTOR. 
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On January 3, 1995, approximately 1817 central standard time, a Beech 65-90, N101GA, was 
destroyed during approach to the Hot Springs, Arkansas, Memorial Airport.  The airline 
transport pilot-in-command and commercial pilot-rated passenger were fatally injured.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed.
The pilot obtained a weather briefing and filed an IFR flight plan to Pueblo, Colorado, at 1442.  
An IFR clearance was issued at 1810 and the airplane took off from Hot Springs at 1814.  One 
minute later, the pilot advised Memphis Air Route Traffic Control Center he had to return to 
Hot Springs.  He was instructed to maintain 3,000 feet.  "We ain't got a problem, we just need 
to come back in and land," the pilot said.  The pilot then asked for permission to switch over to 
the unicom frequency.
According to the pilot's father, operator of Airborne Flying Service, his son called him on the 
radio and said the airplane's cabin heater was not working.  The father suggested that he 
return.  He said the mechanics were still at the airport, they would fix the heater, and he could 
resume his flight without too much delay.  At about this time, he heard his son say, "Oh, 
shoot!"  This was the last radio contact with the airplane.  Two witnesses listening on monitor 
radios confirmed the conversation. One witness said that whereas the pilot did not sound 
panicky, his voice was one of concern. 
Two witnesses who reported seeing the airplane go down were asked to submit written 
statements. None were received.  One of these witnesses, located 5 miles south of the accident 
site, was interviewed by telephone.  He said he saw a "glow in the clouds" that "spread out."  
Seconds later, he heard the engines "screaming," saw a "trail of fire," then heard the noise of a 
"prolonged impact."
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
A maintenance records review disclosed that in October 1993, the airplane's janitrol heater 
(p/n A10D40, s/n 5771618) was removed because it failed the "heater decay test."  After being 
overhauled and pressure checked, the unit was reinstalled in December 1993.  No other 
complaints about the heater were recorded.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
Examination of the accident site revealed a 400-foot swath cut through the tops of trees on a 
magnetic heading of 125 degrees.  At the 80-foot mark were portions of the right horizontal 
stabilizer and elevator.  At the 170 and 200-foot marks were portions of the right wing and left 
horizontal stabilizer and elevator.  Also beginning at this point were burned and sooted trees 
and vegetation.  At the 275-foot mark was the lower portion of the rudder with attached trim 
tab.  The first ground marks were noted at the 400-foot mark.  At the 650-foot mark was the 
left main landing gear.  The left propeller, engine power turbine disk, and reduction gearbox 
were 50 feet left of centerline.  At the 700-foot mark was the aft portion of the cabin, and 90 
feet left of centerline was the nose landing gear.
The cockpit area was located at the 720-foot mark, and the inboard portion of the right wing 
with attached landing gear was 30 feet right of centerline.  At the 820-foot mark was the right 
engine gas generator assembly.  The right propeller was located at the 940-foot mark.
No evidence was found indicative of an inflight fire.  Only the cockpit area was gutted.  The 
remaining wreckage was sooted that was easily rubbed off.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
Autopsies were performed on both occupants (ME-8-95 and ME-9-95) by the Arkansas State 
Crime Laboratory in Little Rock.  Only one trachea was recovered and examined.  According to 
the pathologist, there was no soot or carbonaceous material in the trachea.
Toxicological screens were conducted by the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.  These tests 
were negative for drugs.  Tests for the presence of carbon monoxide and cyanide could not be 
performed.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The wreckage was released to the owner's representative on January 6, 1995.
