THE PILOT ADVISED ON THE COMMON TRAFFIC ADVISORY FREQUENCY THAT THE 
FLIGHT WAS ON A LEFT DOWNWIND FOR THE RUNWAY, CLOSE IN.  THE AIRPLANE 
WAS OBSERVED TO TURN LEFT BASE AND FINAL AND WHILE ON FINAL APPROACH, 
THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH AN UNMARKED STATIC POWER LINE.  THE 
AIRPLANE THEN IMPACTED THE GROUND NOSE AND RIGHT WING LOW AND CAME 
TO REST UPRIGHT. THE ENGINE WAS REMOVED FROM THE AIRPLANE, STARTED, 
AND FOUND TO OPERATE NORMALLY.  EXAMINATION OF THE FLIGHT CONTROLS 
REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF A PREIMPACT FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION.  ACCORDING 
TO THE FAA, THE POWER LINE WAS NOT REQUIRED TO BE MARKED. 
DISTANCE VS. ALTITUDE MISJUDGED BY THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND WHILE ON SHORT 
FINAL APPROACH.  ADDITIONALLY, ALTITUDE/CLEARANCE NOT MAINTAINED WHILE 
ON SHORT FINAL APPROACH RESULTING IN THE COLLISION WITH AN UNMARKED 
STATIC POWER LINE. 
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
     On January 1, 1995, about 1252 eastern standard time, a Cozy MK IV, N5037, built by 
Charles H. Larson, crashed while on approach to land at the Wauchula Municipal Airport, 
Wauchula, Florida, while on a 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed.  The airplane was substantially damaged and 
the pilot and one passenger were fatally injured.  One passenger sustained serious injuries and 
one passenger sustained minor injuries.  The flight originated from the Avon Park Municipal 
Airport, Avon Park, Florida, about 1240.
     An individual who was monitoring the Wauchula Airport Common Traffic Advisory 
Frequency 122.9 due to a gyrocopter fly-in, heard an occupant in N5037 announce that the 
flight was on left downwind for runway 18, "close in."  He advised that person that there were 
numerous gyrocopters in the area and in turn advised the gyrocopter pilots by visual signal to 
stay clear of the fixed wing airplane.  He observed the airplane turn left base and the occupant 
asked about the fuel supply on the airport.  He then heard the individual announce that the 
flight was on final approach to runway 18, which he thought the airplane was low.  The 
individual in N5037 did not mention any problem with the airplane or engine and the witness 
stated that the engine was operating normally.
     Another witness also observed N5037 on the downwind leg for runway 18 stated that the 
airplane appeared to be low.  He observed the airplane turn left base to final and while on final 
approach, the airplane appeared to be low.  While on final approach he observed a flash of light 
just before the airplane nosed over.  He then lost sight of the airplane due to obstructions.  He 
also stated that he was too far away to hear the engine.

COMMUNICATIONS
     An individual in the airplane announced his traffic pattern positions on the Common Traffic 
Advisory Frequency.
AERODROME INFORMATION
     The airport is not certificated under 14 CFR Part 139 and has a 4,000-foot asphalt runway 
designated 18/36, which is a visual runway as defined by 14 CFR Part 77.2.  Unmarked power 
lines parallel both sides of a road which is located north of the approach end of runway 18.  The 
road is nearly perpendicular to the runway near the airport.  According to the Orlando, Florida, 
FAA Airports District Office, the power line was not required to be marked.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT
     Examination of the accident site revealed a cable on the ground adjacent to the airplane.  
The wreckage was upright with the nose landing gear separated.  The right wing fuel tank was 
damaged resulting in fuel leakage; however, the tank was found to contain about 1 gallon of 
fuel when drained.  The left wing fuel tank which was not damaged was drained revealing that 
it contained about 10 gallons.  Examination of the drained fuel revealed no evidence of 
contamination.  The fuel selector was found to be positioned to the right tank.  Examination of 
the flight controls revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.  Examination of 
the Ellison Throttle Body Injection unit revealed that the throttle was at idle.  The carburetor 
heat was determined to be on.  Examination of the nose landing gear which was separated 
revealed evidence that the static line contacted it about 17 inches up from the swivel assembly.  
There was also evidence that the static line contacted both main landing gear near the juncture 
of the fuselage.  The engine with engine mount and propeller attached were removed from the 
airframe and placed on a stand.  The engine was started and found to operate normally.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL
     Post-mortem examination of the pilot and right front seat passenger were performed by 
Alexander Melamud, M.D., District Ten, Medical Examiner.  The cause of death for both was 
listed as multiple injuries.
     Toxicological analysis of specimens of the pilot was performed by the Wuesthoff Memorial 
Hospital Laboratory.  The results of analysis of urine tests were positive for caffeine, nicotine, 
and nicotine metabolite.  The results were negative for cannabinoids, cocaine metabolite, 
opiates, benzodiazepines, and salicylate.  The results were positive in the blood for caffeine. 
The results of blood analysis were negative for cannabinoids, cocaine metabolite, opiates, 
salicylate, benzodiazepines, and volatiles.  Glucose (1 MG/DL) was detected in vitreous fluid.
ADDITIONAL DATA/INFORMATION
    The wreckage was released to Lt. William Beattie of the Wauchula Police Department on 
January 3, 1995.
