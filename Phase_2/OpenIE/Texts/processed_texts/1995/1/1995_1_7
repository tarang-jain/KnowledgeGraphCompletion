ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, WHILE ON THE THIRD TRAFFIC PATTERN OF A SERIES OF 
LANDINGS, HE SMELLED SOMETHING BURNING, AND HE SAW FLAMES COMING 
FROM THE ENGINE COWLING. THE PILOT SHORTENED THE TRAFFIC PATTERN AND 
TURNED TOWARD THE RUNWAY FOR AN EMERGENCY LANDING. THE AIRPLANE 
TOUCHED DOWN LONG, AND ROLLED OFF THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY. 
EXAMINATION OF THE AIRPLANE DISCLOSED THAT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE 
AIRFRAME WAS DESTROYED BY THE FIRE. THE FIRE ALSO DESTROYED SEVERAL 
COMPONENTS OF THE ENGINE ASSEMBLY, INCLUDING THE CARBURETOR. A REVIEW 
OF THE AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE LOGS INDICATED THAT THE CARBURETOR HEAT 
BOX HAD BEEN REPLACED 38 HOURS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. EXTENSIVE FIRE 
DAMAGE PREVENTED THE DISCOVERY OF OR THE EXCLUSION OF A COMPONENT 
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION.  
AN ENGINE FIRE FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS. 
 On January 2, 1995, at 2130 central standard time, a Piper PA-28- 151, N6829F, burst into 
flames after rolling off the departure end of runway 18 at the Foley Municipal Airport in Foley, 
Alabama. The personal flight operated under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91 with no flight 
plan filed. Visual weather conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The airplane was 
destroyed by fire, and the pilot was not injured. The flight departed Foley at 2045 hours.
According to the pilot, he had completed two landings and three takeoffs as part of an effort to 
maintain night currency. The third takeoff was normal, but as the flight continued, the pilot 
began smelling smoke. When the pilot was established on downwind, smoke filled the cockpit, 
and the pilot saw flames coming from the engine compartment. The pilot shortened his normal 
traffic pattern and turned towards the runway. The airplane touched down long on the runway 
and rolled off the departure end. 
Examination of the accident site disclosed that a set of tire tracks started about 400 feet from 
the end of the runway and continued to the point where the airplane rested. The airplane 
rotated 90 degrees left to a 090 degree magnetic heading. Further examination of the runway 
failed to uncover fire damaged debris from the airplane. 
Examination of the airplane disclosed that the right side was destroyed by fire. The engine 
assembly also sustained extensive fire damage which destroyed the carburetor. Due to the fire 
damage, several engine components were destroyed and conclusive examinations were not 
possible. A review of the aircraft maintenance log disclosed that the carburetor heat box was 
replaced 38 hours before the accident.                           
The pilot failed to respond to both telephone and written requests to provide additional 
information about the accident.
