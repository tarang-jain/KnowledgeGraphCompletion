THE FLOAT EQUIPPED AIRPLANE STRUCK A PARTIALLY SUBMERGED LOG DURING A 
SALT WATER LANDING. THE PILOT REPORTED HE LOOKED AT THE  LANDING SITE 
PRIOR TO LANDING, BUT HIS VISION WAS RESTRICTED BY  SUN GLARE AND A THIN 
LAYER OF FOG SITTING ON THE WATER'S SURFACE. SHORTLY AFTER THE PILOT 
REDUCED POWER TO SLOW THE AIRPLANE'S TAXI SPEED, THE RIGHT FLOAT STRUCK 
A LOG. THE AIRPLANE VEERED SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT, AND THE LEFT FLOAT 
STRUT SUBSEQUENTLY COLLAPSED, ALLOWING THE LEFT WING TO STRIKE THE 
WATER. 
THE PILOT'S SELECTION OF AN UNSUITABLE LANDING AREA. FACTORS ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE ACCIDENT WERE THE SUN GLARE, THE PARTIALLY SUBMERGED LOG, AND 
THE SHALLOW FOG LAYER ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER (LANDING SURFACE). 
 On January 2, 1995, at 1035 Alaska standard time, a float equipped Cessna model 208 
(Caravan) airplane, N242SS, operated by Taquan Air Service of Ketchikan, Alaska as scheduled 
flight No. 2, sustained substantial damage when it collided with a partially submerged log 
during a high speed water taxi from landing at Craig, Alaska.  The airline transport certificated 
pilot-in-command, and the seven revenue passengers aboard were not injured.  The 14 CFR 
Part 135 flight departed Ketchikan at 0955, and the destination was Craig. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed, and a VFR flight plan was on file.    
The pilot reported that prior to landing he surveyed the area and thought it safe to perform a 
landing.  He wrote in his report to the NTSB that the bright sunlight and approximately one 
foot of convection fog covering the water surface were restrictions to his visibility. Just after 
coming off a step taxi, he said the right float struck a log, which damaged the right float, and 
caused the airplane to veer to the right.  The resultant side loads on the left float caused it to 
collapse, and the left wing was damaged when it struck the water.
