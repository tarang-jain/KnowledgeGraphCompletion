After adding 6 gallons of fuel to the right fuel tank, the dual student checked the fuel tank 
sumps, completed the pre-flight inspection, and then took off. The instructor stated that during 
cruise flight, the engine lost power. An emergency landing was attempted on a beach. On the 
landing roll the airplane struck a tree stump. Post accident investigation by the instructor 
revealed water in both fuel tanks. 
An inadequate preflight which resulted in water contamination in the fuel system and the 
subsequent loss of engine power. The tree stump was a factor. 
 On December 1, 1995, about 1700 eastern standard time, a Cessna 150M, N8779U, collided 
with a tree stump during a forced landing near Beaufort, South Carolina. The aircraft was 
operated by Master Aviation under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91, and visual flight rules. A 
flight plan was not filed for the instructional flight. There were no injuries to the commercial 
flight instructor, nor the student, and the aircraft was substantially damaged. The flight 
departed Hilton Head, South Carolina, at 1600 on the same day.
     The pilot reported that he fueled the airplane at Hilton Head, prior to takeoff, with six 
gallons of aviation gasoline. All six gallons were added to the right tank. About ten minutes 
after refueling, the student pilot performed a pre-flight inspection, that included sampling the 
fuel from the tank drains. Shortly after take off, while the aircraft was in cruise flight, the 
engine quit. The instructor executed a forced landing. On landing roll, the aircraft struck a tree 
stump, twisting the fuselage, and buckling the tail cone. The pilot stated that after the forced 
landing, he drained fuel from the right wing and the sump. According to him, both samples 
contained water. Upon further examination of the engine, no other engine problems were 
found.
