The pilot reported that, while at 4,500 feet msl, the aircraft engine began to run rough, and 
then lost power. The pilot attempted to execute a forced landing on a roadway, but the aircraft 
hit trees during the approach, then it impacted the terrain next to the roadway. Examination of 
the engine revealed that the fuel injector diaphragm and 'O' ring were leaking. 
The leaking fuel injector, which created a rich mixture, and caused the aircraft engine to lose 
power. 
 On December 1, 1995, at 1130 central standard time, a Bellanca 8KCAB, N53870, was 
substantially damaged following a collision with trees and terrain during a forced landing 
attempt near Alexander City, Alabama. The airline transport pilot received minor injuries in 
the accident. The aircraft was being operated under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91 by the 
pilot. Visual meteorological conditions existed at the time, and a visual flight rules flight plan 
was in effect for the flight. The flight departed Columbus, Georgia, at 1045.
The pilot stated that while at cruise flight at 4,500 feet above mean sea level, the aircraft engine 
began to run roughly, and then stopped producing power. The pilot attempted to execute a 
forced landing on a roadway, but impacted trees, and the terrain during the approach.
Examination of the aircraft engine revealed that the "O" ring and diaphragm in the fuel injector 
servo were leaking. The leaking servo resulted in a rich fuel/air mixtureand subsequent loss of 
engine power.
