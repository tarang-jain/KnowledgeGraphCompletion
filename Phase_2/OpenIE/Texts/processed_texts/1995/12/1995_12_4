During takeoff, the airplane experienced a total loss of engine power. The pilot maneuvered the 
airplane to avoid traffic. As a result, the airspeed became too low and the descent rate could not 
be stopped. The airplane slid off the paved roadway into a ravine. Postaccident examination 
revealed the engine had low compression in one of the two cylinders. The pilot stated he 
thought the loss of power resulted from an ignition problem. 
a loss of engine power for undetermined reasons. A factor related to the accident was the 
presence of traffic requiring the pilot to perform an evasive maneuver. 
 On December 1, 1995, at 1300 central standard time (cst), a Herring Dana Sport Fan, N95SF, 
owned and operated by a private pilot, was substantially damaged during a forced landing, 
shortly after takeoff from runway 17 at Newton City Airport, Kansas.  The pilot reported minor 
injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The personal 
14 CFR Part 91 flight was not operating on a flight plan.  
From the pilot's written statement, the airplane made a normal takeoff, at approximately 300 
feet the engine lost total power.  After an unsuccessful restart, the pilot attempted to land on a 
paved road.  The pilot stated, "...glide was extended to avoid traffic.  As a result, the airspeed 
was too low and descent rate could not be arrested ... ."  The airplane came to rest in a ravine 
alongside the road.
Post accident examination of the airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration Principal 
Maintenance Inspector (PMI), revealed low compression on one out of the two cylinders.  The 
pilot/owner believes the problem might have been an ignition problem.
