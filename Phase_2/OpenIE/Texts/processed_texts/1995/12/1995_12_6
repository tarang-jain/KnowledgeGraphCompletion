THE STUDENT PILOT STATED THAT HE WAS ATTEMPTING A SHORT FIELD TAKEOFF, 
WHEN HE LOST DIRECTIONAL CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE AND RAN OFF THE LEFT 
SIDE OF THE RUNWAY INTO A SHALLOW DITCH.  THE STUDENT PILOT INDICATED 
THAT THE ACCIDENT WAS THE RESULT OF HIS MISTAKE.  HE REPORTED THAT HE 
HAD LESS THAN 17 HOURS OF TOTAL FLIGHT TIME, INCLUDING 3.2 HOURS AS PILOT-
IN-COMMAND. THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED DURING A SOLO INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT. 
was the student pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the aircraft.  The student pilot's 
lack of experience was a related factor. 
 On December 2, 1995, at about 1000 eastern standard time, a Cessna 152, N89188, piloted by 
a student pilot on a solo instructional flight, sustained substantial damage when it departed the 
runway and struck a ditch during an aborted short field takeoff attempt at Stanton County 
Airport, in Stanton, Kentucky.  The student pilot, the sole occupant, reported no  injuries.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, no flight plan was filed.  The flight 
operated under 14 CFR Part 91, and the accident occurred during an attempted takeoff.    
The student pilot told the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector that he was 
practicing solo takeoffs and landings at Stanton, Kentucky.  He stated that when he attempted 
his second takeoff (a short field takeoff), he lost directional control, and ran off the left side of 
the runway into a shallow ditch.  The FAA inspector stated that the student pilot indicated that 
the accident was "...the result of his mistake... ."  The registered owner/operator's 
recommendation as to how the accident could have been prevented was: "More training."  The 
student pilot reported that he had 16.5 hours of total flight time, including 3.2 hours as pilot-
in-command.  A postaccident inspection of the aircraft by a Federal Aviation Administration 
safety inspector revealed no preimpact mechanical anomalies.
