THE CERTIFICATED PRIVATE PILOT AND THREE PASSENGERS LANDED AT A REMOTE 
AREA TO FISH. THE PILOT HAD LANDED AT THE ACCIDENT SITE ON PREVIOUS 
OCCASIONS. THE LANDING AREA WAS SOFT AND MUDDY WITH HIGH GRASS. A LIGHT 
RAIN WAS FALLING IN THE AREA. THE PILOT INDICATED THAT DURING THE 
TAKEOFF ROLL FOR THE RETURN FLIGHT, THE AIRPLANE ACCELERATED TO 60 MPH, 
BUT LIFTOFF WAS IMPEDED BY HIGH GRASS. THE PILOT ABORTED THE TAKEOFF, 
AND THE AIRPLANE TRAVELED BEYOND THE TAKEOFF AREA. THE NOSE GEAR THEN 
FAILED, AND THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER. 
THE PILOT'S SELECTION OF UNSUITABLE TERRAIN, AND HIS DELAY IN ABORTING 
THE TAKEOFF.  THE SOFT TERRAIN AND HIGH GRASS WERE RELATED FACTORS. 
 On August 1, 1995, about 1600 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Piper PA-22-150, 
N7597D, crashed during takeoff from a remote area at the mouth of the Kustatan River, about 
18 miles west of Nikiski, Alaska.  The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) 
cross-country personal flight to Anchorage, Alaska, when the accident occurred.  The airplane, 
operated by the pilot, received substantial damage.  The certificated private pilot and 3 
passengers were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The pilot reported that he landed earlier in the day in soft, muddy terrain to fish in the nearby 
Kustatan River.  He had landed in the area on previous occasions.  The pilot indicated that 
during the takeoff run, the airplane accelerated to 60 MPH but the liftoff was impeded by high 
grass.  The pilot aborted the takeoff and the airplane traveled beyond the intended takeoff area.  
The nose gear then failed  and the airplane nosed over.  The airplane received damage to the 
nose gear and empennage.  The pilot reported that light rain was falling in the area of the 
accident.
