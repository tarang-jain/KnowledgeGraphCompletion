THE CERTIFICATED PRIVATE PILOT AND A PASSENGER WERE SCOUTING FOR SHEEP 
IN A REMOTE MOUNTAINOUS AREA AT 5,500 FEET. THE AIRPLANE ENCOUNTERED A 
DOWNDRAFT AND BEGAN LOSING ALTITUDE AND AIRSPEED. THE PILOT BEGAN A 
TURN AT FULL POWER, BUT THE AIRPLANE CONTINUED TO DESCEND UNTIL IT 
CONTACTED THE GROUND. DURING IMPACT, THE LEFT WINGTIP STRUCK THE 
GROUND, AND THE AIRPLANE CARTWHEELED DOWNSLOPE AND CAME TO REST AT 
AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT 4,800 FEET. PERFORMANCE CHARTS FOR THE AIRPLANE 
INDICATED THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF A 350 FOOT PER MINUTE 
CLIMB. THE PILOT REPORTED SCATTERED RAIN SHOWERS IN THE AREA. 
THE PILOT'S INADVERTENT ENCOUNTER WITH ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS 
AND FAILURE TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT ALTITUDE/CLEARANCE FROM THE 
TERRAIN TO COMPENSATE FOR SUCH CONDITIONS.  FACTORS RELATED TO THE 
ACCIDENT WERE: DOWNDRAFTS, THE PROXIMITY OF MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN, AND 
THE PILOT'S INADEQUATE WEATHER EVALUATION. 
 On August 1, 1995, about 1145 Alaska daylight time, a float equipped Cessna 172A, N345RB, 
collided with terrain while maneuvering in a remote area, about 30 miles east of Chickaloon, 
Alaska.  The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) local area personal flight 
when the accident occurred.  The airplane, operated by the pilot, was destroyed.  The 
certificated private pilot received serious injuries.  The sole passenger received minor injuries.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  A VFR flight plan was filed.  The flight originated 
at the Wasilla Lake Seaplane base, Wasilla, Alaska, at 1042.
The pilot reported that he was flying in the area of Sheep Mountain and Caribou Creek about 
5,500 feet mean sea level (MSL).  He indicated that the airplane encountered a strong 
downdraft and began losing altitude and airspeed at full power.  The pilot began a turn away 
from rising terrain but the airplane stalled about 40 feet above the ground.  The left wingtip 
struck a small rise and the airplane cartwheeled downslope.  The engine was torn from the 
airplane and the fuselage was broken in-half.  The airplane came to rest about 4,800 feet msl.  
The airplane was reported overdue to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and an alert 
notice (ALNOT) was issued at 1603.  Search aircraft located the accident site by tracking the 
airplane's emergency locator transmitter (ELT) about 1900.
The pilot reported that the airplane was 128 pounds below gross weight.  A review of climb data 
from the airplane owners manual revealed that at gross weight, 5,000 feet and 41 degrees F, 
the airplane should have been capable of a 350 foot per minute climb.  The pilot also indicated 
that scattered rain showers were present in the area.
