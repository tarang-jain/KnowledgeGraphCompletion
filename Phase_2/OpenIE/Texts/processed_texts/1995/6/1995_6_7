THE AIRPLANE LANDED AT A LOCAL AIRPORT, WHERE THE PILOT PURCHASED AUTO 
FUEL FROM A VENDOR.  PLASTIC CONTAINERS WERE USED TO TRANSPORT THE 
FUEL TO THE AIRPLANE.  DURING INITIAL CLIMB AFTER TAKEOFF, THE ENGINE 
LOST POWER AND THE PILOT MADE A FORCED LANDING.  DURING THE LANDING 
THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER.  EXAMINATION REVEALED THE AIRPLANE'S FUEL 
TANKS ALL CONTAINED AUTO FUEL, AND THE CARBURETOR BOWL CONTAINED 
WATER AND SEDIMENT.  THE PLASTIC CONTAINERS USED TO TRANSPORT THE FUEL 
ALSO CONTAINED WATER AND SEDIMENT. 
The pilot's inadequate preflight inspection, which failed to detect water-contaminated fuel 
which resulted in the loss of engine power.  Also causal was the pilot's failure to maintain 
airspeed during the forced landing, which resulted in the inadvertent stall/spin and collision 
with the terrain.  
 On June 1, 1995, at 1430 eastern daylight time, a Taylorcraft BC-12, N43705, was substantially 
damaged during a forced landing after takeoff from the Geneseo Airport, Geneseo, New York.  
The private pilot was seriously injured and the passenger received minor injuries.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed, for the personal flight originating at Geneseo.  No flight 
plan had been filed for the flight conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
    The pilot and passenger flew from Lancaster, New York, to the Geneseo Airport (D52), the 
day of the accident.  While at D52, the pilot purchased auto fuel from a local vendor to refuel 
his airplane, and used plastic containers to transport the fuel.  After about 45 minutes of 
ground time at D52, the pilot and passenger boarded the airplane for the return trip to 
Lancaster. 
    In the NTSB Form 6120.1/2, the pilot stated that he performed a soft field takeoff at D52, 
and during the initial climb the engine lost power.  He then observed trees and power lines at 
the end of the runway, and elected to attempt a landing to the left of the runway.  
    The pilot further stated:
     ...Airplane proceeded to glide normally, then at      approximately 100 feet, the nose of the 
aircraft      dropped straight down and the aircraft plunged to the      ground...
    In a written statement, a witness to the accident said:
     ...I heard an aircraft engine miss.  I looked north      towards the runway and saw a blue and 
white aircraft at      about 100 feet.  It's engine quit, and it turned and      dived vertically to the 
left, hitting the ground.
    A Federal Aviation Administration Airworthiness Inspector examined the wreckage at the 
accident site.  The Inspector's report stated that the airplane's three fuel tanks contained auto 
fuel, and the carburetor bowl contained water and sediment.  The Inspector also examined the 
plastic containers used to transport the auto fuel to the airplane.  His report stated, "...it 
appears the same sediments and water drained from the carburetor bowl were found in the 
plastic containers..."
