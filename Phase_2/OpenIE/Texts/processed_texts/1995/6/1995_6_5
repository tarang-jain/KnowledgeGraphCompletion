THE PILOT STATED THAT WHILE ON HIS FOURTH TAKEOFF, THE AIRPLANE 'QUIT 
FLYING, BOUNCED ACROSS MERIDIAN BETWEEN RUNWAY AND TAXIWAY, SLID 
ACROSS THE TAXIWAY AND STOPPED.' THE PILOT STATED THAT OBSERVERS AND 
WITNESSES TOLD HIM THAT THE AIRPLANE'S ENGINE BACKFIRED AND IT SOUNDED 
LIKE THE ENGINE THROTTLED BACK THEN FORWARD AGAIN. THE RESPONDING FAA 
INSPECTOR FOUND NO WITNESSES WHO GAVE A REPORT SIMILAR TO THE PILOT'S 
IMPRESSION. THE FAA INSPECTOR REPORTED THAT THE PILOT SAID HE LOST 
DIRECTIONAL CONTROL AT LIFT-OFF, VEERED OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY, 
AND COLLIDED WITH THE TAXIWAY. DAMAGE TO THE PROPELLER, THE NOSE GEAR, 
THE NOSE COWLING, LOWER ENGINE MOUNT, AND FIREWALL RESULTED. THE 
PILOT DID NOT REPORT HIS FLIGHT TIME IN THE 90-DAY PERIOD PRIOR TO THE 
ACCIDENT. REVIEW OF THE AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE RECORDS DISCLOSED THAT 
THE AIRCRAFT HAS FLOWN ONLY 7 HOURS SINCE AUGUST OF 1994. AFTER THE 
ACCIDENT, THE AIRPLANE WAS EXAMINED BY AN AIRFRAME AND POWERPLANT 
MECHANIC. THE MECHANIC DID NOT FIND ANY DISCREPANCY IN THE AIRFRAME OR 
THE ENGINE. 
the pilot's premature liftoff and his failure to attain and maintain sufficient airspeed during the 
intial climb which resulted in an inadvertent stall/mush back onto the runway.  The pilot's 
failure to maintain directional control as the aircraft touched down again is also causal.  A 
factor in the accident is the pilot's lack of recent flight experience. 
 On June 1, 1995, at 1641 hours Pacific daylight time, a Beech B23, N6985Q, crashed during 
takeoff at Mariposa Airport, Mariposa, California.  The aircraft was owned and operated by the 
pilot.  The aircraft was substantially damaged.  The certificated private pilot, the sole occupant, 
was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the local flight.  The 
flight originated at 1500 as a local area personal flight.
In the Pilot/Operator written report, the pilot stated that while on his fourth takeoff, the 
airplane "quit flying, bounced across meridian between runway and taxiway, slid across the 
taxiway and stopped."  The pilot stated that observers and witnesses told him that the 
airplane's engine backfired and it sounded like the engine throttled back then forward again.  
The responding Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector from the Fresno, California, 
Flight Standards District Office, found no witnesses who gave a report similar to the pilot's 
impression.
According to the FAA inspector, the pilot was doing pattern work at the Mariposa airport on 
runway 26.  The inspector reported that the pilot said he lost directional control at lift-off, 
veered off the left side of the runway, and collided with the taxiway.  Damage to the propeller, 
the nose gear, the nose cowling, lower engine mount, and firewall resulted.
The pilot did not report his flight time in the 90-day period prior to the accident.  Review of the 
aircraft maintenance records disclosed that the aircraft has flown only 7 hours since August of 
1994.
After the accident, the airplane was examined by an airframe and powerplant mechanic.  The 
mechanic did not find any discrepancy in the airframe or the engine.
