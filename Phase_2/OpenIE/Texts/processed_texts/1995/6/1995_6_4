THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE 
AFTER ENCOUNTERING WAKE TURBULENCE FROM A LANDING SAAB 340. THE PILOT 
STATED THAT A TWO MILE SEPARATION WAS MAINTAINED WHEN HE WAS CLEARED 
TO LAND BEHIND THE COMMUTER AIRPLANE. WIND WAS FROM 200 DEGREES AT 4 
KNOTS. 
THE PILOT'S INABILITY TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL AFTER 
ENCOUNTERING WAKE TURBULENCE FROM A LANDING AIRPLANE. A FACTOR WAS 
THE TAILWIND. 
 On June 1, 1995, at 1355 central daylight time, a Cessna 120, N76856, sustained substantial 
damage during landing near College Station, Texas.  The commercial pilot was not injured.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight.    
According to witnesses at the airport, the airplane was executing a touch and go landing on 
Runway 10 at the Easterwood Airport (CLL).  The pilot made a wheel landing and was rolling 
on the main tires when control was lost and the airplane departed the runway to the left.  The 
main gear tires stuck in the soft mud at the edge of the runway and the airplane nosed over 
coming to rest in the inverted position, resulting in damage to the wings and fuselage. 
The pilot stated that he was cleared to follow a Saab 340 airplane to land on runway 10.  The 
pilot estimated that he had a two mile separation behind the landing regional airliner.  The 
pilot stated that directional control could not be maintained after encountering the wing vortex 
wake turbulence from the landing aircraft.  He further stated that the light quartering tailwind 
prevailing at the time of the accident contributed to the accident.  Wind was from 200 degrees 
at 4 knots.
