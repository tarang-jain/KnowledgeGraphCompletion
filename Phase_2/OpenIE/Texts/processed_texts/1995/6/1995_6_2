DURING TAKEOFF FROM A WET, GRASS-COVERED, 1,800 FOOT-LONG, PRIVATE 
AIRSTRIP, THE AIRPLANE LIFTED OFF THEN SETTLED BACK ONTO THE GRASS STRIP.  
THE PILOTED ABORTED THE TAKEOFF ABOUT 1,000 FEET DOWN THE AIRSTRIP.  THE 
PILOT INTENTIONALLY ANGLED THE AIRPLANE OFF THE AIRSTRIP INTO TALL GRASS 
TO HELP STOP THE AIRPLANE.  THE AIRPLANE ROLLED DOWN AN EMBANKMENT 
AND ITS NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED.  THE PILOT STATED HE THOUGHT THE ENGINE 
DIDN'T SEEM TO BE DEVELOPING FULL POWER. POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION 
REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF PREIMPACT MECHANICAL ANOMALY. 
the pilot's poor planning/decision making in the attempted departure.  Contributing factors are 
the wet, recently mowed grass airstrip, and the embankment/downhill grade encountered 
during the aborted takeoff. 
 On June 1, 1995, at 1730 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 172N, N3065E, was substantially 
damaged during an aborted takeoff from a private airstrip in Head Waters, Virginia.  The 
commercial pilot and the two passengers were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed.  The personal flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91, and the intended 
destination was Manassas, Virginia.
According to a Federal Aviation Administration Safety Inspector, the pilot and passengers 
departed Manassas to view some property for sale at Head Water.  The pilot stated that he 
landed the airplane on a field which had been a private airstrip years ago.  A witness on the 
ground stated that at the time N3065E landed, the grass was about 12 inches high.  The witness 
stated at the pilot's request he mowed a portion of the field prior to the attempted takeoff.  
The pilot reported on his Safety Board Pilot Aircraft Accident Report form, "Performed a 
soft/short field take off procedure using 10 [degrees] of flaps.  As aircraft became airborne it 
didn't seem to be developing full power....Aborted takeoff going over embankment at end of 
runway."
According to the FAA Safety Inspector, during an interview with the pilot after the accident, the 
pilot stated that during the takeoff roll he thought the engine lost about 100 to 150 revolutions 
per minute.  The pilot stated he aborted the takeoff about 1,000 feet down the 1,500 foot long, 
wet, grass airstrip.  He stated he steered the airplane into taller grass in attempt to "...assist the 
braking action."  The pilot said that the airplane "...appeared to almost be stopped, but went 
down a 4 foot-high embankment at the end of the airstrip."  The pilot stated that while rolling 
down the embankment, the airplane's nose gear collapsed and the airplane nosed down.  The 
left wing contacted the ground damaging the wing's strut.
Postaccident examination of the accident site revealed the airstrip to be a portion of a mowed 
grass field with the surrounding grass being about 12 inches high.  The mowed section of the 
field was about 20 feet wide and 1,500 feet long.  The mowed grass was not removed.  About 
1,200 feet down the mowed strip there were three ground marks that departed the mowed strip 
and continued through the taller grass down an embankment.  
Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any anomalies.
