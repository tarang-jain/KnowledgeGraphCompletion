The student pilot reported that he lost directional control of the airplane during an aborted 
touch and go attempt. The directional control problem was compounded when the throttle 
knob came off of the throttle control as the student attempted to reduce engine power. 
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control during an aborted takeoff attempt.  A 
factor was the stripped throttle knob threads. 
 On October 2, 1995, at 1730 central daylight time, a Socata    TB-9, N152ND, nose gear 
collapsed after the student pilot lost control of the airplane during the go phase of a touch and 
go landing at Pryor Field in Decatur, Alabama. The supervised solo flight operated under the 
provisions of 14 CFR Part 91 with no flight plan filed. Visual weather conditions prevailed at 
the time of the accident. The airplane was substantially damaged, and the student pilot was not 
injured. The flight departed Huntsville, Alabama, at 1700 hours. 
According to the student pilot, this was his second supervised solo flight. He had completed 
one touchdown, and was on the go phase of the first of a series of touch and go landings. As the 
airplane accelerated for the takeoff, the airplane veered off the left side of runway 18. When the 
student pilot attempted to regain control of the airplane, the throttle knob came off the throttle 
control lever. 
The  student pilot did not report a mechanical problem with the airplane. Examination of the 
airplane also failed to disclose a mechanical problem. This aircraft is equipped with an arm 
type throttle control lever; the throttle lever was still fully operational without the knob 
assembly.
