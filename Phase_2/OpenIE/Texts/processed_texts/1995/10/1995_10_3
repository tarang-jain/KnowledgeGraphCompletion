mechanical failure of the left brake. 
 On October 1, 1995, at 1130 central daylight time (cdt), a Luscombe Phantom 1, N272Y, piloted 
by an airline transport pilot was substantially damaged when it ran off the edge of runway 27 
(3,028' x 36' dry asphalt) while landing at Rolla Downtown Airport, Rolla, Missouri.  The 
personal 14 CFR part 91 flight was not operating on a flight plan.  Visual meteorological 
conditions existed at the time of the accident.  The pilot reported no injures.  The flight 
departed Matton, Illinois, at 1000 cdt.
The pilot reported after the aircraft touched down, full right rudder input would not stop the 
aircraft from turning left.  The aircraft departed the left side of the runway, coming to rest 
opposite the landing direction.  Examination of runway 27 revealed a single tire skid mark 
approximately 15 feet long located 100 feet from the runway end.  N272Y is equipped with 
mechanical brakes which are operated by cables.
During a telephone interview with the pilot he said he thought the left brake locked.  The pilot 
said the runway was in poor condition.  The airport facility directory states that the runway has 
broken asphalt with loose material, and is rolling and uneven.  During a telephone 
conversation with the airport operator he said the airport runway was currently being 
resurfaced.
N272Y'S landing gear strut wires failed during the accident. The pilot said the landing gear 
strut wires had been chromed, which may have weakened them.
