THE AIRPLANE IMPACTED TREES AFTER IT OVERRAN THE DEPARTURE END OF THE 
2,200-FOOT GRASS STRIP DURING TAKEOFF. THE PILOT STATED THAT INITIALLY THE 
AIRPLANE ACCELERATED NORMALLY FOR THE SHORT FIELD TAKEOFF UNTIL 
ROTATION SPEED WAS ATTAINED. SOON AFTER LIFTOFF THE AIRPLANE NEVER 
GAINED MORE AIRSPEED 'LIKE IF SOMETHING WAS HOLDING THE AIRPLANE 
DOWN.' THE PILOT FURTHER STATED THAT WHEN HE REALIZED THAT HE WAS NOT 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO CLEAR THE TREES AT THE DEPARTURE END OF THE STRIP, HE 
ELECTED TO ABORT THE TAKEOFF. HE DETERMINED THAT THE AIRPLANE WAS 
WITHIN WEIGHT AND BALANCE LIMITS, AND HE CALCULATED THE TAKEOFF 
DISTANCE AND DETERMINED THAT 'THEY HAD AMPLE TAKEOFF DISTANCE.'  A 
REVIEW OF THE TAKEOFF DISTANCE CHARTS IN THE PILOT'S OPERATING 
HANDBOOK REVEALED THAT TO CLEAR A 50-FOOT OBSTACLE REQUIRED 2,350 FEET 
WITH THE FLAPS DOWN, AND 2,950 FEET WITH THE FLAPS UP. 
THE PILOT'S DELAY IN ABORTING THE TAKEOFF. A FACTOR WAS THE PILOT'S 
IMPROPER USE OF THE AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE DATA. 
 On October 1, 1995, at 1415 central daylight time, a Beech A36, N7247W, was substantially 
damaged during takeoff from a private airstrip near Cotulla, Texas.  The private pilot and his 4 
passengers were not injured.  The airplane, owned by Excellent Aviation Rentals Inc., of 
Houston, Texas, was being operated under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed for the business flight for which an IFR flight plan was filed.
According to the pilot, the winds were light and variable when he taxied to the northwest end 
of the 2,200 foot grass airstrip for a departure to the southeast.  The pilot added that after 
completing the run-up and configuring the airplane in a short field takeoff configuration, he 
applied full power for takeoff.
The pilot further stated that initially the airplane accelerated normally until rotation speed was 
attained for the short field takeoff.  The pilot added that after becoming airborne, "the airplane 
never gained any more airspeed after liftoff, like if something was holding the airplane down."  
The pilot stated that when he realized that the airplane was not going to be able to clear the 
trees at the departure end of the airstrip, he elected to abort the takeoff.  The airplane came to 
rest about 200 to 300 feet into the trees.
Prior to departing the airstrip, the pilot stated that he had determined that the airplane was 
within takeoff and CG limits.  Additionally, he reported that he calculated the takeoff distance 
for the prevailing configuration and determined that "they had ample takeoff distance."
A review of the performance charts for takeoff distance from the pilot's operating handbook 
(copies enclosed) revealed the takeoff ground run distance with flaps down and up to be 1,200 
and 1,500 feet respectively.  Likewise, it was determined that 2,350 and 2,950 feet respectively 
would be required to clear a 50 foot obstacle with flaps down and up.  The height of the 
obstacles at the departure end of the airstrip was not provided by the either the pilot or the 
operator.
