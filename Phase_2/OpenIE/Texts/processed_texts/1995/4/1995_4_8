THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO TAKEOFF FROM A GRASS RUNWAY WITH A DIRECT 10 TO 
12 KNOT CROSSWIND.  HE STATED 'A GUST OF WIND PUT US AIRBORNE MUCH 
BEFORE I WAS READY TO BRING UP THE TAIL...BLEW US COMPLETELY OFF THE 
RUNWAY.'  THE LANDING GEAR CAUGHT THE TOP STRAND OF A BARBED WIRE 
FENCE.  THE PILOT REPORTED THE AIRPLANE PULLED UP ABOUT 1,000 FEET OF 
FENCE BEFORE THE AIRPLANE WAS PULLED BACK TO THE GROUND. 
the pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions during the attempted takeoff.  The 
gusty crosswind was a factor. 
 On April 2, 1995, at 1146 central daylight time, a Bellanca 7ECA, N2598Z, piloted by the 
owner/operator, crashed during an aborted takeoff at a private grass airstrip in Higginsville, 
Missouri.  The airplane sustained substantial damage when it struck a barbed wire fence, then 
impacted terrain.  The private pilot and the one passenger on board the airplane received 
serious injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight, no flight plan 
was filed.  The pleasure flight operated under 14 CFR Part 91, and the accident occurred during 
the intended takeoff.     
The pilot reported he attempted to takeoff from the 2,300' X 100' grass runway with a direct 
crosswind which he estimate to be 10 to 12 knots.  He stated "...a gust of wind put us airborne 
much before I was ready to bring up the tail.  The wind gust blew us completely off the runway.  
Unknowingly, as I was attempting to get back to the runway, I picked up the top strand of 
barbed wire...I pulled up about 1,000 feet of fence before it stopped my flight and caused the 
plane to crash onto the runway."  The pilot stated the accident could have been prevented if he 
had been "...very wary of strong crosswinds, particularly when buildings or obstructions are 
adjacent to runway."
