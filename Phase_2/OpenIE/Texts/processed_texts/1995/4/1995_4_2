DURING A LOW PASS OVER A GRASS STRIP, THE AIRPLANE'S ENGINE LOST PARTIAL 
POWER.  THE PILOT OVERFLEW THE STRIP AND ENTERED THE DOWNWIND LEG OF 
THE TRAFFIC PATTERN.  DURING THE APPROACH THE AIRPLANE'S ALTITUDE WAS 
TOO LOW AND THE PILOT ADDED POWER.  THE AIRPLANE BEGAN TO 'FLOAT' DOWN 
THE RUNWAY AND THE ENGINE BEGAN TO BACKFIRE.  THE PILOT DECIDED TO DO A 
GO AROUND, HOWEVER, THE AIRPLANE'S CLIMB RATE WAS DEGRADED AND THE 
AIRPLANE COULD NOT CLEAR TREES THAT SURROUNDED THE STRIP. THE AIRPLANE 
COLLIDED WITH THE TREES.  THE PILOT STATED THAT HE HAD APPLIED HEAT TO 
THE CARBURETOR PRIOR TO THE LOW PASS.  POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE 
ENGINE REVEALED NO ANOMALIES.  THE ENGINE WAS STARTED AND RAN FOR FIVE 
MINUTES WITH NO ANOMALIES NOTED.  CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE TO LIGHT 
CARBURETOR ICING AT GLIDE OR CRUISE POWER EXISTED. 
The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons. 
 On April 1, 1995, at 1030 eastern standard time, a Cessna 150, N3546V, lost partial engine 
power during a low pass over Waisley Airport in Erie, Pennsylvania, and collided with trees 
during the emergency descent.  The pilot was not injured.  The airplane was substantially 
damaged.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  The local personal flight was conducted 
under 14 CFR Part 91.
The pilot reported that during a low pass over the grass strip at Waisley Airport, the airplane's 
engine "...started to miss, spit, and sputter."  The pilot stated that prior to the low pass he 
applied heat to the carburetor and left it on. The pilot said that he decided to make a 
precautionary landing and made a downwind pattern for the runway. 
The pilot reported, "Did a short downwind pattern, altitude indicated 1250 FT. agl on line up to 
runway.  I was short of field, added a little power, 46V started to balloon, possibly from ground 
affect, 46V engine back fired twice, airstrip (Elev 950 FT-Runway L-2000 FT) 46V would land 
long, fearing collision to occupied house on west end of runway, gave 46V full throttle, turned 
slowly to left (to prevent stall)."  The pilot stated that the airplane had "...a poor climb rate..." 
and would not clear obstacles around the runway.  The pilot stated that he made an emergency 
landing off the airport and during the descent, the airplane collided with trees.
Postaccident examination of the engine did not reveal any anomalies.  No contaminates were 
found in the fuel.  The engine was started and run for about five minutes with no anomalies 
noted.  No airframe anomalies were found.  
The pilot stated that he thought "...there was carburetor icing present."
At 0952, the Erie Weather Observation Facility recorded a temperature of 39 degrees 
Fahrenheit and a dew point of 21 degrees Fahrenheit.  According to Icing Probability Curves, 
conditions which are known to be favorable to the formation of light induction system icing at 
glide or cruise power existed.  (See attached Icing Probability Curves.)
