THE AIRPLANE WAS IN CRUISE FLIGHT IN INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL 
CONDITIONS WHEN THE ENGINE SUDDENLY BEGAN RUNNING ROUGH, THEN LOST 
ALL POWER. THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO RESTORE POWER, BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. 
HE COULD NOT REMEMBER IF HE SWITCHED FUEL TANKS. HE MADE A FORCED 
LANDING ON A MOUNTAIN ROAD. DURING THE LANDING ROLL, THE LEFT WING 
STRUCK A PARKED CAR. THE FUEL SELECTOR WAS FOUND POSITIONED ON THE LEFT 
FUEL TANK. THE LEFT FUEL TANK FINGER SCREEN WAS FOUND TO BE BLOCKED BY 
GREEN LEAVES. THE ENGINE OPERATED SUCCESSFULLY AT FULL POWER AFTER THE 
FUEL SCREEN WAS CLEANED AND REINSTALLED. 
FUEL STARVATION DUE TO FOREIGN MATERIAL PARTIALLY BLOCKING THE FUEL 
SCREEN, AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO SWITCH FUEL TANKS. A FACTOR WAS THE 
LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN FOR THE FORCED LANDING. 
 On April 2, 1995, approximately 1930 mountain daylight time, a Mooney M20J, N4478H, was 
substantially damaged when it collided with an automobile during a forced landing near 
Tijeras, New Mexico.  The commercial pilot and automobile occupant were not injured.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed.
The following is based on the pilot/operator report.  The airplane had been flying at 12,000 feet 
MSL (above mean sea level) in instrument meteorological conditions with occasional light rain.  
As the airplane emerged into visual meteorological conditions, the pilot noticed the cylinder 
head and exhaust gas temperature gauges had "dropped off the scale."  He adjusted the 
mixture and the instrument readings began to return to normal.  Shortly thereafter, the engine 
began to run rough and lost power.
The pilot's efforts to restore engine power were unsuccessful.  He declared an emergency with 
Albuquerque Approach Control, then made a forced landing in mountainous terrain on New 
Mexico Highway 337.  During the landing roll, the left wing tip struck a parked car.
After relating these events to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, the pilot said 
he did not remember if he had switched fuel tanks in his attempt to restore engine power.  The 
fuel selector was found positioned on the left fuel tank.
At the request of the pilot, the airplane was transported to Clearlake, California, for repairs.  In 
the presence of an FAA airworthiness inspector, the engine was functionally tested on August 
23, 1995.  During the first test, the engine ran rough at high power settings (2,650 RPM and 26 
to 28 inches of manifold pressure), and the fuel pressure fluctuated between 5 an 14 pounds 
per square inch (psi).  During the second test, engine power again ran rough at a high power 
setting (2,600 RPM, 25 inches manifold pressure).  Fuel pressure was 3 psi.  When the fuel 
boost pump was turned on, fuel pressure rose to 5 psi.  The right fuel tank was selected and the 
engine ran smoothly.  When the fuel selector was switched back to the left tank, the engine ran 
rough.
The left fuel tank finger screen was removed and found to be plugged with what was described 
as "leaf roller bug."  After the finger screen was cleaned and reinstalled, the engine was tested 
again and operated smoothly at all power settings on both the left and right fuel tanks.
