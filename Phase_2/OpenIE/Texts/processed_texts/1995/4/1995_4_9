 On April 2, 1995, at 1515 central daylight time (CDT), a Piper PA-22-20, N4917Z, operated on 
a personal flight by Darwin Jaenicke of Kankakee, Illinois, ground looped at the Greater 
Kankakee airport (IKK) and sustained substantial damage.  The Airline Transport rated pilot, 
and private pilot passenger/owner were uninjured.  Visual meteorological conditions existed at 
the time of the accident, winds were reported as 5 to 8 knots, and no flight plan was filed.  The

During three point landing practice, the airplane bounced, contacted the left wing, and 
departed the right side of the 5,979 foot long by 100 foot wide asphalt runway.  The left main 
landing gear collapsed as it contacted soft dirt, the left wing spar was damaged, and the 
propeller struck the ground.
