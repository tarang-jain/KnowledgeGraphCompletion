DURING TAKEOFF CLIMB, THE AIRPLANE'S ENGINE LOST TOTAL POWER.  THE 
AIRPLANE STRUCK A FUEL TRUCK AND BRICK HANGAR WHILE BEING MANEUVERED 
BACK TO THE DEPARTED RUNWAY.  POSTACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE 
AIRPLANE REVEALED THE FUEL SELECTOR VALVE WAS IN THE OFF POSITION.  FUEL 
WAS FOUND IN THE ENGINE'S GASCOLATOR AND FUEL LINES.  THE AIRPLANE'S 
THREE FUEL TANKS WERE BREACHED DURING THE ACCIDENT.  WITNESSES AT THE 
AIRPORT STATED THAT THEY SAW THE PILOT 'TOP OFF' THE AIRPLANE PRIOR TO 
THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT.  NO OTHER AIRFRAME OR ENGINE ANOMALIES WERE 
NOTED. 
THE PILOT'S IMPROPER POSITIONING OF THE FUEL SELECTOR. 
 On April 2, 1995, at 1336 eastern daylight time, a Piper  PA-J3-C65, N70234, lost total engine 
power during takeoff climb from runway 18 at the Bayport Aerodrome, Bayport, New York. The 
airplane struck a fuel truck and hangar while being maneuvered back to the departed runway.  
The non certificated pilot was seriously injured.  The airplane was destroyed.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed.  The local flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
According to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Safety Inspector, the pilot reported that 
during initial climb, about 200 to 300 feet above the ground, the airplane's engine "coughed" 
and then lost total power.  The pilot reported he turned the airplane 180 degrees back toward 
the departed runway and during the maneuver the airplane's right wing impacted a fuel truck.  
The airplane impacted the fuel truck and continued into a brick hangar.
Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed the fuel flow selector valve was in the OFF 
position.  Fuel was found in the engine's gascolator and throughout the engine fuel lines.  The 
airplane's three fuel tanks were breached during the accident.  Witnesses at the airport 
reported to a Federal Aviation Administration Inspector that the pilot "...topped off the 
airplane..." prior to the accident flight.
No other airframe or engine anomalies were noted.
The pilot received a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Pilot/Operator Aircraft 
Accident Report, Form 6120.1/2, but did not complete and return it to the Safety Board.
