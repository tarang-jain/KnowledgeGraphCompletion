DURING THE LANDING ROLL THERE WAS A SUDDEN WINDSHIFT OF ABOUT 180 
DEGREES.  THE PILOT STATED HE COMPENSATED FOR THE WINDS USING FULL 
RUDDER, BRAKE, AND AILERON INPUT.  THE PILOT SAID THAT DESPITE HIS 
CONTROL INPUT THE AIRPLANE CONTINUED OFF THE RUNWAY INTO SAND AND 
NOSED DOWN. 
The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions and his inadequate evaluation of the 
weather conditions which resulted in an overrun.  A factor is the sudden windshift. 
 On April 1, 1995, at 1315 eastern standard time, an Aeronca Champ 7AC, N85713, was 
substantially damaged during landing roll on runway 06 at the Lakewood Airport, Lakewood, 
New Jersey.  The pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  The local 
flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
The pilot reported that the purpose of the flight was to practice takeoffs and landings at the 
Lakewood Airport.  He stated that after touchdown during the landing roll the wind shifted 180 
degrees and the airplane "...veered violently to the left causing me to hit right rudder and brake 
and put stick to left as far as possible."  The pilot stated the airplane continued off the runway 
into soft sand and nosed down.  He stated the airplane's right wing and propeller were 
damaged.
The pilot also noted that minutes after the accident the airport closed and then reopened with 
the active runway changed from runway 06 to 24.
No airframe or engine anomalies were reported.
