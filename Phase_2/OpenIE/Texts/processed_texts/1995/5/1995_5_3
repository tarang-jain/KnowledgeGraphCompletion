DURING THE INITIAL CLIMB AFTER TAKEOFF, THE AIRPLANE STRUCK 
TRANSMISSION LINES AND THEN LANDED. WHILE LANDING THE AIRPLANE NOSED 
OVER AND CAME TO REST IN AN INVERTED POSITION. 
the pilot's failure to maintain clearance with transmission wires.  A factor in the accident was 
the transmission wires. 
 On May 1, 1995, at 1214 central daylight time, an experimental Sorrel, N2026, was 
substantially damaged when it collided with transmission lines after taking off from Aero Park 
Airport, Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.  The pilot and passenger reported minor injuries.  The 
local 14 CFR Part 91 pleasure flight operated without a flight plan in visual meteorological 
conditions. 
According to the pilot, he performed a normal preflight in preparation for the local pleasure 
flight.  The pilot stated he then taxied to the end of runway 05 (1250' x 110') at Aero Park and 
began his takeoff roll.  The pilot stated the ground roll was normal and the airplane lifted off 
mid-field.  While climbing the airplane struck transmission lines which are located 
approximately a 1/4 mile from the end of the runway.  The pilot made a forced landing.  While 
landing the airplane nosed over and came to rest in an inverted position.
In a telephone interview with the pilot, he stated "everything seemed fine except for the 
[airplane's] climb rate."  The pilot stated "...the engine instruments were in the green."  He 
stated that he did have the flaps extended to their normal extension of 5-10 degrees on takeoff.  
The pilot stated he had full fuel aboard and a weight and balance calculation done prior to the 
flight indicated the weight to be 100 pounds under the airplane's gross weight.  
A postaccident examination of the engine revealed no mechanical abnormalities.
