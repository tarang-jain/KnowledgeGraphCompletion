THE PILOT REPORTED IN HIS WRITTEN STATEMENT THAT HE WAS CONDUCTING AN 
ENGINE RUNUP BECAUSE THE ENGINE WOULD NOT DEVELOP FULL POWER.  HE 
DECIDED TO TAXI DOWN THE RUNWAY WITH NO INTENTION OF TAKING OFF, BUT 
INADVERTENTLY BECAME AIRBORNE. SHORTLY AFTER THE UNINTENTIONAL 
TAKEOFF, THE ENGINE LOST PARTIAL POWER, TURNED  TO THE RIGHT AND 
IMPACTED TERRAIN. POST-ACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED 
EVIDENCE OF HEAT DAMAGE AND ABNORMAL PISTON RING WEAR.  THERE WERE 
SCRAPE MARKINGS ON THE PISTON, PISTON RINGS, AND CYLINDER WALL. THE 
PILOT STATED THAT HE PERFORMED THE CYLINDER AND RING CHANGE AND WAS 
NOT AWARE THAT THE CYLINDER AND RING COMBINATION WERE NOT 
COMPATIBLE. 
the pilot's improper maintenance installation and his inadvertent takeoff.  A factor was the 
pilot's inadequate pre-flight planning. 
 On May 2, 1995, at 1827 eastern standard time, a Franklin EAA Bi- Plane/P1, registered to a 
private owner, of Rockville, Indiana, received substantial damage on impact with terrain 
following a takeoff to the west and experiencing a loss of engine power.  The personal 14 CFR 
Part 91 flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions.  The pilot reported minor 
injuries.  No flight plan was on file.  The local flight was on departure from the Bulter Airport, 
Rockville, Indiana, at the time of the accident.  
The pilot reported in his written statement, that he was conducting an engine runup, because 
the engine would not develop full power. He decided to taxi down the runway with no intention 
of taking off, but inadvertently became airborne.  The engine sustained a power loss shortly 
after liftoff. 
Witnesses stated that the takeoff appeared normal until at the end of the runway, the engine 
sounded like it was reduced to idle power.  
Postaccident examination of the engine was conducted.  An FAA Inspector's report stated, 
"...evidence of heat damage and abnormal piston ring wear.  There were scrape markings on 
the piston, piston rings, and cylinder wall...".  The pilot said that he performed a cylinder and 
piston ring change and was not aware that the rings and cylinder were not compatible.
