THE 14 CFR PART 135 CARGO FLIGHT WAS PLANNED FOR 1 HOUR DURATION.  THE 
PILOT-IN-COMMAND (PIC) AND SECOND-IN-COMMAND (SIC) HAD FLOWN FIVE LEGS 
PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT LEG. THE PIC DID A WALK AROUND AND VISUAL 
INSPECTION OF THE AIRPLANE, WHILE THE SIC LOADED THE CARGO. THE CREW 
STATED THE FUEL GAUGES INDICATED ABOUT HALF FULL. ABOUT 45 MINUTES INTO 
THE NIGHT IMC FLIGHT, THE LEFT ENGINE 'SPUTTERED.' THE PIC ATTEMPTED 
VARIOUS FUEL TANK AND CROSS FEED SELECTIONS FOR THE LEFT AND RIGHT 
ENGINES. DURING THESE SELECTIONS, THE RIGHT AND LEFT ENGINES COMPLETELY 
LOST POWER. THE PIC DECLARED AN EMERGENCY AND WAS PROVIDED A RADAR 
VECTOR TO THE AIRPORT. THE AIRPLANE DESCENDED CLEAR OF THE CLOUDS 
ABOUT 3 MILES FROM THE AIRPORT. UNABLE TO GLIDE TO THE AIRPORT, THE PIC 
PERFORMED A GEAR-UP LANDING IN AN OPEN FIELD. EXAMINATION REVEALED THE 
RIGHT WING FUEL DRAIN HAD BROKEN OFF DURING IMPACT. NO USEABLE FUEL 
WAS DRAINED FROM THE LEFT OR RIGHT FUEL TANKS. ABOUT 1 OUNCE OF FUEL 
WAS DRAINED FROM EACH ENGINE FUEL SYSTEM. 
the pilot's inadequate preflight of the airplane's fuel quantity, resulting in a complete loss of 
engine power due to fuel exhaustion, and the subsequent night forced landing and collision 
with the terrain. 
 On May 2, 1995, at 0425 eastern daylight time, a Beech 58, N4575S, operated by U.S. Check, 
Columbus, Ohio, was substantially damaged during a forced landing to an open field near the 
Port Columbus International Airport (CMH), Columbus, Ohio.  The airline transport rated 
pilot-in-command (PIC) and the commercial rated second-in-command (SIC) received serious 
injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that originated at the 
Allegheny County Airport, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  An IFR flight plan had been filed for the 
cargo flight conducted under 14 CFR Part 135. 
    The flight crew had flown five legs that evening, prior to the accident leg to CMH.  The 
planned flight time to CMH was about 1 hour.  
    In the NTSB Form 6120.1/2, the PIC stated that while the SIC loaded the cargo, he 
performed a walk around and visual inspection of the airplane.  The PIC then boarded the 
airplane and verified the fuel quantity by checking the gauges.  The SIC stated that both the left 
and right fuel gauges indicated about half full.  
    The PIC said that the takeoff and climb were uneventful.  After they leveled off at 4,000 feet, 
he set the fuel flow of both engines to 18 gallons per hour.  
    During radar vectors for an instrument approach to CMH, while in night IMC conditions, the 
PIC stated that the left engine "sputtered."  He further stated:
     I turned the left boost pump on and switched the left      fuel selector to X-feed.  The right 
engine at this      point lost power.  I turned the right boost pump on and      moved all of the 
mixture, propeller and throttle levers      to full.  I turned the left fuel selector to main tank      
and the right fuel selector to X-feed.  The left engine      started to surge, but the right engine 
still did not      produce any power...I switched the right back to main.      The fuel gauges were 
reading: left bouncing above the      yellow arc, and the right gauge was reading just below      
half tanks.  I declared a fuel emergency...and      requested direct to the field...we were loosing 
altitude      rapidly.  We broke out at 2,200 feet MSL and were      approximately 3 miles 
southwest of the field...we did      not have sufficient altitude to glide to the      airport...We 
ended up in a field approximately 2 miles      southwest of the field [CMH].
    According to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector's statement, examination of 
the wreckage revealed 1 ounce of fuel was present in each of the left and right engine fuel lines.  
No fuel was removed from the right engine fuel injection system, and about 1 teaspoon of fuel 
was removed from the left.
    The right wing inboard fuel drain was broken, and an undetermined amount of fuel had 
leaked out.  The left wing inboard fuel drain was intact, and the fuel cell contained 
approximately 1 cup of fuel.  Examination of the left and right wing fuel strainers revealed that 
they each contained about 1 ounce of fuel, and were absent of water and foreign particulates.
    When the batteries were energized, the left fuel gauge indicated between zero and 1/4, and 
the right gauge indicated zero.  The Inspector stated that the left fuel indicator was erratic 
when the outer wing skin was tapped in the vicinity of the fuel quantity transmitter.  The left 
wing fuel quantity transmitters were removed from the airplane and inspected.  Both worked in 
unison and operated correctly.
