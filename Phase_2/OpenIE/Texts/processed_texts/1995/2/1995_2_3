THE HELICOPTER, BEING USED FOR PREDATOR CONTROL, WAS 25 FEET ABOVE THE 
GROUND AND WAS CHASING A BOBCAT. THE PILOT SAID A RIGHT QUARTERING 
TAILWIND GUST CAUSED THE HELICOPTER TO LOSE TAIL ROTOR EFFECTIVENESS 
AND IT BEGAN SPINNING TO THE RIGHT. THE PILOT INCREASED COLLECTIVE AND 
THROTTLE IN AN ATTEMPT TO REGAIN AIRSPEED, BUT THIS CAUSED THE MAIN 
ROTOR RPM TO DROOP AND ALTITUDE WAS INSUFFICIENT TO ALLOW THE 
HELICOPTER TO REGAIN AIRSPEED BY LOWERING THE NOSE. THE PILOT THEN 
REDUCED COLLECTIVE TO REGAIN RPM, BUT THE HELICOPTER CONTINUED TO SPIN 
AND IMPACTED THE TERRAIN. 
THE LOSS OF TAIL ROTOR EFFECTIVENESS. A FACTOR WAS THE GUSTY RIGHT 
QUARTERING TAILWIND. 
 On February 1, 1995, approximately 1500 central standard time, a Bell 47G-4A, N6SR, was 
destroyed when it impacted terrain while maneuvering near El Indio, Texas.  The airline 
transport rated pilot and one passenger were not injured, but a second passenger received 
minor injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The following is based on the pilot/operator report.  The helicopter was being used for predator 
control and was chasing a bobcat about 25 feet above the ground.  The pilot said a right 
quartering tailwind gust caused the helicopter to lose tail rotor effectiveness and it began 
spinning to the right.  He increased collective and throttle in an attempt to regain airspeed, but 
this caused the main rotor RPM to droop and altitude was insufficient to allow the helicopter to 
regain airspeed by diving.  He then reduced collective to regain RPM, but the helicopter 
continued to spin and impacted the terrain.
