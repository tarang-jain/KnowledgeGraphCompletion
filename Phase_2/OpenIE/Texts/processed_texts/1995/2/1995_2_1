THE PILOT WAS LANDING AN AMPHIBIOUS FLOAT EQUIPPED AIRPLANE AT A 
SEAPLANE BASE ON A CROSS-COUNTRY CARGO FLIGHT.  AS THE AIRPLANE WAS 
SLOWING AND CAME OFF THE FLOAT STEP, IT SUDDENLY SWERVED TO THE RIGHT.  
THE PILOT APPLIED FULL LEFT RUDDER AND FULL POWER TO CORRECT THE 
SWERVE AND SUBMERGED THE LEFT FLOAT.  THE LEFT WING AND LEFT 
HORIZONTAL STABILIZER CONTACTED THE WATER.  THE AIRPLANE WAS BEACHED 
AND INSPECTION REVEALED DAMAGE TO THE STABILIZER AND WING.  THE PILOT 
HAD ACCRUED 30 HOURS OF FLIGHT IN THE ACCIDENT AIRCRAFT MAKE AND MODEL 
IN THE PREVIOUS 4 MONTHS. 
A FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE.  
THE PILOT'S EXCESSIVE REMEDIAL REACTION AND LACK OF TOTAL EXPERIENCE IN 
THE ACCIDENT AIRCRAFT MAKE AND MODEL WERE FACTORS IN THE ACCIDENT. 
 On February 1, 1995, about 1234 hours Alaska standard time, an amphibious float equipped 
Cessna 185F, N1095F, crashed during a water landing at West Point Village seaplane base, 
Kodiak Island, Alaska.  The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-
country cargo flight to West Point Village, under Title 14 CFR Part 135 when the accident 
occurred.  The airplane, operated by MarkAir Express, Anchorage, Alaska, sustained 
substantial damage.  The certificated commercial pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  Company VFR flight following procedures were in 
effect.  The flight originated at Kodiak airport, Kodiak Island, about 1212 hours. 
The pilot reported that he was landing in calm water conditions adjacent to several canneries 
and did not observe any obstacles in the landing area.  After touchdown, he reduced power and 
as the airplane came off the float step, it veered sharply to the right.  The pilot added full power 
and full left rudder.  The airplane then turned back to the left, submerging the left float.  The 
left wing tip and left horizontal stabilizer struck the water.  The airplane was then beached and 
inspected.  The inspection revealed damage to the left wing and left stabilizer.  The left float 
was not damaged.
According to the pilot/operator report submitted by the operator, the pilot had accrued 30 
flight hours as pilot-in-command in the accident aircraft make and model.  The pilot completed 
his initial operating experience in the accident aircraft make and model on October 11, 1994.
