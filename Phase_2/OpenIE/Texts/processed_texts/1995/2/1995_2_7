pilot was completing a visual flight rules personal flight.  The airplane, registered to Barclay 
Contractors, Sisters, Oregon, sustained substantial damage.  Neither the certificated private 
pilot nor his passenger were injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  The flight 
originated at Redmond Airport, Redmond, Oregon, at 1340 hours.
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness inspector from the Reno (Nevada) 
Flight Standards District Office, reported that the pilot said the touchdown was normal.  
During the landing roll, the airplane swerved to the left and he applied power.  The pilot said 
he perceived that the airplane momentarily straightened out and he applied the brakes.  The 
airplane then swerved to the right and began to skid to the left.  The airplane departed the right 
side of the runway and the left wing struck a dirt berm.
The pilot said in the aircraft accident report that during the landing rollout, he "touched" the 
right brake and the airplane veered to the right.  He reported no mechanical malfunctions.
