THE AIRPLANE DEPARTED FROM THE GRASS STRIP FOR A LOCAL FLIGHT AROUND 
THE RANCH. THE PILOT SELECTED 30 DEGREES OF FLAPS, AND THE AIRPLANE 
BECAME AIRBORNE PRIOR TO REACHING THE MIDFIELD POINT OF THE 2,600-FOOT 
RUNWAY. HE STATED THAT THE AIRPLANE CLIMBED TO APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET 
ABOVE THE GROUND AND THE CLIMB SUBSIDED UNTIL THE AIRPLANE NEARLY 
LEVELED OFF AS THE AIRPLANE WAS HEADED TOWARDS RISING TERRAIN. HE 
RETRACTED THE FLAPS TO 20 DEGREES TO IMPROVE THE CLIMB PERFORMANCE. HE 
MAINTAINED CONTROLLED FLIGHT AS HE MANAGED TO AVOID THE LARGER TREES 
WHILE LOOKING FOR AN OPEN AREA. CONTROL WAS LOST AS THE PILOT SLOWED 
THE AIRPLANE PRIOR TO IMPACTING TREES. A 10 TO 20 KNOT HEADWIND 
PREVAILED AND THE PILOT STATED THAT A DOWNDRAFT WAS 'CREATED BY THE 
OROGRAPHIC EFFECT OF THE WIND BLOWING OVER THE RIDGE LINE.' SEVERAL 
WORKERS AT THE RANCH WITNESSED THE AIRPLANE 'ATTEMPTING TO CLIMB IN 
THE DIRECTION OF RISING TERRAIN WITHOUT GAINING ALTITUDE.' 
THE PILOT'S ENCOUNTER WITH A DOWNDRAFT AND HIS INABILITY TO OUTCLIMB 
RISING TERRAIN. FACTORS WERE THE RISING TERRAIN AND HIGH WINDS. 
 On November 1, 1995, at 1600 central standard time, a Helio HT- 295, N68889, was destroyed 
following a loss of control during initial takeoff climb near Llano, Texas.  The airline transport 
rated pilot was seriously injured, one passenger sustained minor injuries, and two other 
passengers were not injured.  The airplane was operated as a business flight by High Tech Inc., 
of Dallas, Texas, under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the 
local flight for which a flight plan was not filed.
According to the law enforcement officer who interviewed the pilot at the hospital, the aircraft 
departed from a grass airstrip at the Hickory Bluff Ranch near Llano, Texas, for a local flight 
around the ranch.  Several workers at the ranch witnessed the airplane "attempting to climb in 
the direction of rising terrain without gaining altitude." 
In a telephone interview conducted by the investigator in charge, and in enclosed NTSB Form 
6120.1/2, the pilot stated that he selected a 30 degree flap setting as called for a short field 
takeoff.  During the takeoff roll the engine sounded "normal" and the airplane broke ground 
prior to reaching mid field and a climb attitude was established.  The pilot added that as the 
airplane climbed to about 100 feet above the ground, the "climb went from positive to 
approximately level," attitude as he approached rising terrain.
The pilot further stated that he elected to retract the flaps to a 20 degree setting to "improve on 
the climb performance" by reducing drag.  The pilot attempted to maintain controlled flight 
and "flew around the larger trees looking for an open area" but the "rising terrain towards the 
ridge made it impossible to avoid contact."  Control was lost as the pilot "pulled the joke back" 
and slowed the airplane prior to impact with the trees. 
The airplane came to rest approximately a 1/2 mile from the point of departure and a post-
impact fire destroyed the airplane.  The pilot and the front seat passenger of the airplane told a 
law enforcement officer that the engine "was operating normally during the flight." 
On the enclosed Pilot/Operator Report, the pilot stated that a 10 to 20 knot headwind 
prevailed at the time of his departure from the 2,600 foot airstrip.  During the telephonic 
interview with the investigator in charge, the pilot attributed the deterioration in climb 
performance to a downdraft "created by orographic effect of the wind blowing over the 
ridgeline."
