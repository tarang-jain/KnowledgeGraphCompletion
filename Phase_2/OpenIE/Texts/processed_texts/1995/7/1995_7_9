THE PILOT STATED THAT DURING THE TAKEOFF,  '...PILOT SNEEZED.  AIRCRAFT 
PITCHED UP [AND] ROTATED PREMATURELY....'  THE PILOT ABORTED THE TAKEOFF.  
DURING THE ABORTED TAKEOFF, THE AIRPLANE OVERRAN THE MOWED PORTION 
OF THE GRASS STRIP AND COLLIDED WITH A UTILITY POLE AT THE DEPARTURE END

the pilot's improper decision to takeoff with a tailwind condition on an unimproved grass strip 
and a subsequent premature rotation resulting in an aborted takeoff and a subsequent collision 
with a utility pole on the departure end of the grass strip. 
 On July 1, 1995, about 1645 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 337G, N72168, piloted by Earnest 
O. Bower, was substantially damaged during takeoff from a private grass strip, in Brant, New 
York.  The pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  There was no 
flight plan for the flight conducted under CFR 14 Part 91.
In the NTSB form 6120.1/2, the pilot stated, 
     Conditions favored takeoff to east.  Normal takeoff      run.  Pilot sneezed, aircraft pitched up 
[and] rotated      prematurely.  Decision to abort takeoff.  Pilot landed.       During roll out, plane 
suddenly turned 90 degrees      left...caused by rock stopping left main wheel. Could      not stop 
before left wing struck power pole.
Additionally, the pilot reported that the winds were from the northwest at 4 knots.  At 
Chautauqua County, Jamestown, New York, about 30 miles to the southwest, the winds were 
reported from 310 degrees at 8 knots.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector stated in his report:
     ...[The] accident occurred as Mr. Bower was attempting      a takeoff from this unimproved 
farm field....In      [this]...accident, the takeoff was attempted with a      tailwind estimated at 8 
to 10 knots and field growth of      approximately 12 inches....The aircraft struck a      utility pole 
at the east end of the field and crossed a      road before stopping.  The takeoff run had begun on 
a      mowed strip approximately 1500 feet long at the west      end of the field, and ended in an 
unmowed area      approximately 2000 feet long at the east end of the      field....
Postaccident examination by the FAA Inspector revealed no anomalies with the engine or 
airframe.
