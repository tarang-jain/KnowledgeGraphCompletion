THE PILOT APPLIED POWER AT THE COMPLETION OF A LOW PASS OVER A RUNWAY 
AND NOTICED A VIBRATION 1 TO 2 SECONDS LATER. THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY A LOSS 
OF PROPELLER THRUST AND HIGH ENGINE RPM.  THE PILOT SECURED THE ENGINE, 
AND DUE TO THE LOCATION OF PERSONNEL AND TREES, INITIATED A TURN BACK TO 
THE RUNWAY.  AT THE COMPLETION OF THE TURN, HIS APPROACH TO THE RUNWAY 
WAS OBSTRUCTED BY ANOTHER AIRPLANE, AND THE PILOT LANDED IN A ROUGH 
FIELD ADJACENT TO THE RUNWAY.  DURING THE LANDING ROLL, THE MAIN 
LANDING GEAR AND LEFT WING SEPARATED.  INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE 
AIRPLANE WAS EQUIPPED WITH A SUBARU ENGINE AND A ONE-OF-A-KIND, THREE-
BEARING, PROPELLER SPEED REDUCTION UNIT (PSRU).  THE THREE-BEARING PSRU 
HAD REPLACED A PRODUCTION TWO-BEARING PSRU, WHICH HAD ACCUMULATED 
125 HOURS SUCCESSFULLY.  EXAMINATION OF THE PSRU REVEALED THAT THE 
PROPELLER SHAFT FAILED NEAR THE CENTER BEARING.  THIS WAS DUE TO 
THERMAL EXPANSION OF A MOUNTING PLATE, WHICH RESULTED IN A BENDING OF 
THE SHAFT AT THE CENTER BEARING. 
failure of the propeller speed reduction unit due to an inadequate design change by the 
manufacturer, which resulted in a complete loss of thrust.  A factor was the rough terrain.  
 On July 1, 1995, at 1150 eastern daylight time, a homebuilt VARI-EZE, CGMEZ, was 
substantially damaged during a forced landing to the Malone-Dufort Airport (MAL), Malone, 
New York.  The private pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, for 
the personal flight that departed MAL, at 1130.  No flight plan had been filed for the flight 
conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
    In the NTSB Form 6120.1/2, the pilot stated that he had completed three loose formation 
passes over runway 23, with another homebuilt airplane.  He added power at the completion of 
the last low pass, and noticed a vibration 1 to 2 seconds later.  This was followed by a loss of 
propeller thrust and high engine RPM.  
    The pilot secured the engine, and due to personnel to his left, and trees directly ahead and to 
the right, he initiated a turn back to the runway.  At the completion of the 180 degree turn, he 
observed the airplane from the formation flight approaching head-on.  The pilot then 
performed a landing to a rough field, adjacent to runway 23.  During the landing roll, the main 
landing gear and left wing separated from the airplane.
    The pilot stated that initial examination of the wreckage revealed that the propeller shaft had 
failed at the junction of the middle bearing inner ring. 
    The pilot further stated:
     Prior to removal of the PSRU [propeller speed reduction      unit], a professional mechanical 
engineer and several      other knowledgeable people inspected the failed PSRU.       The PSRU 
vendor was also consulted by phone.  It was      agreed by all...the cause was bending induced 
fatigue      failure, induced by thermal expansion of the PSRU back      plate.  This caused the 
front bearing to rise while the      center and rear bearings were held rigid by the common      
housing.  This induced a slight bend in the shaft with      the stress focused right at the center 
bearing inner      ring.
    The PSRU was sent to the Transportation Safety Board (TSB) of Canada, for further 
examination.  The TSB of Canada report stated:
     ...the shaft failed in a progressive manner from      fatigue cracking at the stress 
concentration provided      by the change in shaft diameter...The material of      construction 
was shown to be a unalloyed steel, in the      normalized condition, resulting in a relatively low      
strength material for the application.  The fatigue      resistance of the part would certainly have 
been      improved by the use of the intended AISI 4140 alloy      material...
    The airplane was built in 1984, and flown 566 hours with a Lycoming, O-234 engine.  In 
1994, the Lycoming engine was replaced by a Subaru, EA-81.  In addition, a synchronous belt 
PSRU was installed.  This was a "two bearing" unit, that drove the propeller at a ratio of 1.84 to 
1.  The airplane accumulated another 125 hours with this installation.  
    During the winter of 1994/1995, the PSRU was replaced with a one-of-a-kind unit.  This unit 
utilized a third bearing to provide support for a longer propeller shaft.  According to the pilot's 
statement, the new unit was ground tested for 8 hours, and flown for 49 flight hours, prior to 
the failure.
