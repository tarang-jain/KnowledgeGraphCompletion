DURING THE AERO TOW OPERATION, THE GLIDER'S LEFT WING RAISED.  THE PILOT 
APPLIED OPPOSITE AILERON, BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS.  THE GLIDER RIGHT WING 
DRAGGED THE DIRT RUNWAY AND THEN THE GLIDER GOUND LOOPED.  THE AERO 
TOW PILOT RELEASED THE GLIDER WHEN IT DRAGGED THE RIGHT WING.  
INITIALLY, THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE DEPARTED ON A NORTHWESTERLY 
RUNWAY AND THAT THE WINDS WERE CALM.  IN THE ACCIDENT REPORT HE SAID 
HE DEPARTED AN EASTERLY RUNWAY AND THAT THE WINDS WERE FROM THE 
SOUTHEAST BETWEEN 0 AND 15 KNOTS. 
the pilot's inadequate compensation for the existing wind conditions. 
 On July 1, 1995, at 1400 hours Pacific daylight time, a Showalter Tern Sailplane glider, N7322, 
dragged the right wing tip during an aero tow departure on runway 07 at Krey Field, Adelanto, 
California.  The pilot was beginning a local visual flight rules personal flight.  The glider, 
registered to and operated by the pilot, sustained substantial damage.  The certificated private 
pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The pilot reported this accident to the National Transportation Safety Board on July 7, 1995.  
He said that during the aero tow, the glider right wing tip dragged the runway and then "spun 
around."  The right wing folded and the tail section separated.  He also said the airplane did 
not experience any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures, and that the surface winds 
were calm.
The pilot said in the accident report that the glider departed runway 07.  When the pilot 
initially reported this accident to the Safety Board on July 7, 1995, he said the airplane 
departed runway 29.  He also indicated in the report that the surface winds were from the 
southeast between 0 and 15 knots.
In the accident report, the pilot said that during the aero tow the left wing raised.  He applied 
left aileron, but there was insufficient aileron control and the right wing continued downward 
until it struck the ground.  The aero tow airplane pilot released the glider when the glider right 
wing struck the ground.
