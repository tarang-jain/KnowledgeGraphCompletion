WHILE EN ROUTE TO ROCKINGHAM, NORTH CAROLINA, THE AIRCRAFT 
EXPERIENCED A GRADUAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER.  THE CONDITION 
DETERIORATED TO THE POINT WHERE THE PILOT WAS FORCED TO EXECUTE AN 
EMERGENCY LANDING IN A FIELD. THE AIRCRAFT TOUCHED DOWN IN SOFT DIRT 
AND NOSED OVER.  AN EXAMINATION OF THE FUEL SYSTEM FOUND RUST 
CONTAMINATION IN THE FUEL TANKS, FUEL LINES AND GASOLATOR.  THE PILOT 
HAD PURCHASED THE AIRCRAFT JUST PRIOR TO THE FLIGHT.  HE HAD FLOWN THE 
AIRCRAFT ONCE BEFORE HE PURCHASED IT, AND HAD EXPERIENCED NO PROBLEMS 
WITH THE AIRCRAFT.  THE PREVIOUS OWNER STATED THAT THE AIRCRAFT HAD 
BEEN SITTING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME WITH A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF FUEL IN 
THE TANKS.  THE PILOT REFUELED THE AIRCRAFT AFTER PURCHASE, AND FOUND 
NO CONTAMINATION WHEN THE FUEL TANK SUMPS WERE DRAINED BEFORE THE 
ACCIDENT FLIGHT. 
CONTAMINATION OF THE FUEL SYSTEM WHICH RESULTED IN FUEL STARVATION 
AND A TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER. . 
 On July 1, 1995, at 1340 eastern daylight time, a Knosp Corbin Jr. Ace-E, N74RK, nosed over 
in a soft field during an emergency landing, after a loss of engine power, near Whiteville, North 
Carolina. The personal flight operated under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91, with no flight 
plan filed. Visual weather conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage, and the pilot received minor injuries. The flight departed 
Southport, North Carolina, at 1300 hours. 
The pilot purchased the aircraft just prior to the flight. He had flown the aircraft before 
purchasing it, and had not experienced any problems with the aircraft.  According to the pilot, 
the airplane was refueled, after he purchased it, with 10 gallons of 100 low lead fuel. He 
sumped the fuel during preflight, and found no fuel contamination.  About 30 minutes into the 
flight, the pilot noticed a gradual loss of engine power. The condition deteriorated to the point 
where the pilot was forced to land. The pilot selected an open field for the emergency landing. 
The airplane touched down in the soft dirt and nosed over.
An examination of the aircraft fuel system revealed rust particles in the fuel.  The gasolator 
bowl was removed. Sludge and rust was found at the bottom of the bowl.  After cleaning the 
fuel system and lines of rust, an engine run was performed.  All systems operated normally.  No 
mechanical malfunction was found.
According to the previous owner of the aircraft, he allowed it to sit for a long period of time 
with a low amount of fuel in the tanks, prior to the current owner's purchase of the aircraft.  
The aircraft was within its annual inspection.
