 On July 1, 1995, at 1435 hours mountain standard time, a Piper PA-22-160, N2820Z, collided 
with trees during a forced landing following takeoff at Payson, Arizona.  The forced landing was 
precipitated by a loss of engine power in the takeoff initial climb.  The aircraft was owned and 
operated by the pilot, and was beginning a personal cross-country flight to Glendale, Arizona.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time.  The aircraft sustained substantial 
damage.  The certificated private pilot and his one passenger sustained minor injuries.  The 
flight was originating at the time of the accident.
The pilot reported that he purchased 20 gallons of fuel from the airport prior to departure.  
Responding fire department personnel stated that they turned off the fuel valve to control a 
fuel line leak after the accident.
An FAA inspector from the Scottsdale, Arizona, Flight Standards District Office examined the 
aircraft and reported finding no discrepancies.  Fuel samples from the aircraft tanks and 
carburetor, and from the airport fuel truck used to refuel the aircraft, were taken for laboratory 
analysis.  According to the laboratory report, the fuel samples tested were consistent with 
aviation gasoline.  No significant water or other contaminants were found.
