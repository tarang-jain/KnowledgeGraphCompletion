THE PILOT DEPARTED WITH THE FUEL GAUGES INDICATING 1/2 FULL.  HE MADE 
ONE FULL STOP LANDING BUT DID NOT REFUEL.  AFTER EXECUTING A PRACTICE 
APPROACH AND MISSED APPROACH PROCEDURE ON HIS RETURN TRIP, THE ENGINE 
SPUTTERED.  HE DECIDED TO SHUT THE ENGINE DOWN AND MAKE A FORCED 
LANDING.  HE HAD BEEN FLYING FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS. HE LANDED IN A BEAN 
FIELD, BUT DUE TO THE RECENT RAINS THE GROUND WAS SOFT.  THE NOSE WHEEL 
DUG INTO THE GROUND AND THE AIRCRAFT FLIPPED OVER ONTO ITS BACK. DURING 
THE INSPECTION OF THE AIRPLANE, BOTH WING TANK SUMPS WERE DRAINED AND 
EACH HAD ABOUT 1/3 CUP OF FUEL REMAINING. 
The failure of the pilot to do adequate preflight planning and failure to refuel when he had the 
opportunity.  A factor in the accident was the soft field due to recent rains.  
 On July 1, 1995, at 1150 central daylight time, a Cessna 177B, N13734, sustained substantial 
damage during a forced landing due to loss of engine power near Nappanee, Indiana.  The 
private pilot reported no injury. The 14 CFR Part 91 flight departed Rochester, Indiana, enroute 
to Mishawaka, Indiana.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was 
filed.
In his written statements and phone conversations, the pilot reported that he had departed 
Mishawaka with the fuel gauges indicating 1/2 full. He landed at Rochester, Indiana, but did 
not refuel before returning to Mishawaka.  While returning, he executed a practice approach 
and missed approach at Goshen, Indiana.  As he was proceeding to the Goshen VOR (GHS) for 
the missed approach procedure, the engine sputtered and he shut the engine down.  He had 
been flying for about two hours when this occured. 
He then picked out a field and proceeded with the forced landing. He touched down in a bean 
field that he had picked out as his landing spot.  Due to the recent rains the ground was soft. 
After traveling about 200 feet, the nose wheel dug into the dirt and the airplane to flipped over 
onto its back. 
During the inspection of the airplane, both wing tank sumps were drained and each contained 
about 1/3 cup of fuel.
