THE AIRCRAFT WAS MAKING A RIGHT-HAND TURN IN THE RUN-UP AREA AT A SLOW 
SPEED WHEN THE LEFT MAIN LANDING GEAR COLLAPSED. THE SIDE BRACE FOR 
THE MAIN LANDING GEAR IS ATTACHED TO A CASTING, WHICH IN TURN IS BOLTED 
TO THE INBOARD WING RIB IN THE LANDING GEAR WHEEL WELL. EXAMINATION 
REVEALED THAT THE WING RIB WEB CRACKED AROUND THE CASTING, WHICH 
ALLOWED THE SIDE BRACE TO MOVE AND THE LANDING GEAR TO COLLAPSE. 
PORTIONS OF THE CRACK APPEARED DISCOLORED AND OLD. REVIEW OF THE 
AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE RECORDS REVEALED NO HISTORY OF LANDING GEAR 
DAMAGE OR HARD LANDING RELATED MAINTENANCE ACTIVITY. THE AIRCRAFT WAS 
LAST INSPECTED DURING AN ANNUAL INSPECTION 7 MONTHS AND 60 FLIGHT 
HOURS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. CESSNA AIRCRAFT COMPANY REPORTED THAT IN 
RESPONSE TO CRACKS FOUND ON THE INBOARD WING RIB WEB AROUND THE SIDE 
BRACE FITTING, SERVICE LETTER ME76-2 WAS ISSUED ON JANUARY 5, 1976.  THE 
LETTER DETAILS THE INSTALLATION OF A STEEL REINFORCEMENT/DOUBLER PLATE 
ON THE WING RIB WEB BEHIND THE LANDING GEAR SIDE BRACE FITTING. 
INSPECTION OF THE AIRCRAFT REVEALED THAT SERVICE LETTER ME76-2 WAS NOT 
ACCOMPLISHED. 
the failure of the wing rib web due to undetected cracking in an area of known crack 
development around the landing gear side brace fitting.  The operator's failure to accomplish a 
Service Letter addressing the problem is a factor in the accident. 
 On July 1, 1995, at 0750 hours Pacific daylight time, a Cessna 401A, N444RJ, sustained a left 
main landing gear collapse while taxiing for departure at Van Nuys, California.  The aircraft 
was owned and operated by the pilot, and was beginning a cross-country flight to Cabo San 
Lucas, Mexico.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time.  The aircraft incurred 
substantial damage to the left wing, left wing tip fuel tank, and the associated engine and 
propeller.  Neither the certificated private pilot nor his four passengers were injured.
According to the pilot's statement and witness observations, the aircraft was making a right-
hand turn in the run-up area at a slow speed when the left main landing gear collapsed.
The side brace for the main landing gear is attached to a casting, which in turn is bolted to the 
inboard wing rib in the landing gear wheel well.  Examination of the aircraft by an FAA 
airworthiness inspector revealed that the wing rib web cracked around the casting, which 
allowed the side brace to move and the landing gear to collapse.  The inspector reported that 
portions of the crack appeared discolored and old.
Review of the aircraft maintenance records revealed no history of landing gear damage or hard 
landing related maintenance activity. The aircraft was last inspected during an annual 
inspection 7 months and 60 flight hours prior to the accident.
Cessna Aircraft Company was contacted for information regarding known wing rib web 
failures.  Cessna stated that there are no known total landing gear collapse incidents due to 
cracks in the wing rib web.  The company reported that in response to cracks found on the 
inboard wing rib web around the side brace fitting, Service Letter ME76-2 was issued on 
January 5, 1976.  The letter details the installation of a steel reinforcement/doubler plate on 
the wing rib web behind the landing gear side brace fitting.
Inspection of the aircraft revealed that Service Letter ME76-2 was not accomplished.
