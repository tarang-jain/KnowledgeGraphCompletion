THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE LEFT FUEL GAGE WAS NOT WORKING AND BOTH 
FUEL TANKS WERE FULL PRIOR TO DEPARTURE.  HE DID NOT LEAN THE ENGINE 
DURING THE 2.7 HOUR FLIGHT.  THE PILOT INITIATED A GO-AROUND DURING AN 
ATTEMPTED LANDING.  WHEN THE AIRPLANE WAS AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 50 
FEET, THE ENGINE LOST POWER.  THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO LAND THE AIRPLANE 
ON THE REMAINING RUNWAY.  THE AIRPLANE DEPARTED THE RUNWAY AT THE 
DEPARTURE END AND 'SLID INTO THE TREES.'  EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE 
REVEALED NO USABLE FUEL REMAINED IN THE FUEL TANKS AND THE FUEL LINES 
WERE EMPTY.  ABOUT 3/8 INCH OF FUEL REMAINED IN THE CARBURETOR BOWL.  A 
FUEL LINE FITTING WAS LEAKING NEAR THE FUEL PUMP. 
the pilot's operation of the airplane with an inoperative fuel gage and the leaking fuel line 
fitting, which resulted in fuel exhaustion, loss of engine power, and a forced landing.  The 
inoperative fuel gage was a related factor. 
 On September 1, 1995, at 1115 eastern daylight time, a Grumman AA-5, N9528L, was 
destroyed when it impacted the terrain during an attempted go around at the Welke Airport, 
Saint James, Michigan.  The private pilot and one passenger reported minor injuries.  The 
personal flight originated in Three Rivers, Michigan, about 0830, and was conducted under 14 
CFR Part 91 in visual meteorological conditions.  No flight plan was filed.
The pilot reported that the left fuel gage was not working and both fuel tanks were full prior to 
departure.  He did not lean the engine during the flight and used fuel from the right tank for 
approximately one hour.  He switched to the left tank for the remaining 1.7 hours of the flight.  
The pilot initiated a go around during an attempted landing on runway 17.  When the airplane 
was at an altitude of about 50 feet, the engine lost power.  The pilot attempted to land the 
airplane on the remaining runway.  The airplane departed the runway at the departure end and 
"slid into the trees."
Examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector revealed 
both fuel tanks were ruptured.  A "trace" of fuel remained in the right tank. The left tank was 
empty.  No fuel remained in the fuel lines and about 3/8 inch of fuel remained in the 
carburetor bowl.  An inspection cover in the outboard section of the left fuel tank and the quick 
drain in the right fuel tank were stained a red color.  The quick drain was in the closed position.  
He reported the airplane would normally have approximately 4 hours of usable fuel.
An aircraft inspector who examined the airplane reported that a fuel line fitting was leaking 
near the fuel pump.
