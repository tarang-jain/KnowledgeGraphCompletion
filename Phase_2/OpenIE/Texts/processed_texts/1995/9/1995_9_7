THE PILOT OF AN AMPHIBIOUS AIRPLANE DEPARTED FROM AN AREA OF WATER 
WITH WAVES AND BOAT WAVES. DURING THE INITIAL TAKEOFF CLIMB, ABOUT 10 
FEET ABOVE THE WATER, THE ENGINE LOST TOTAL POWER. THE PILOT LANDED THE 
PLANE BACK ON THE WATER, BUT 'SLIGHTLY NOSE DOWN,' AND THE FUSELAGE WAS 
BUCKLED. AN OPERATIONAL CHECK OF THE ENGINE WAS MADE, AND NOTHING 
ABNORMAL WAS NOTED. 
The pilot's inadequate flare for landing, which resulted in an in-flight collision with rough 
water.  Factors relating to the accident were: loss of engine power for an undetermined reason 
and rough water. 
 On September 1, 1995, at 1330 eastern daylight time, a Lake LA-4-200, N5TB, an amphibious 
airplane, sustained substantial damage during a water landing, following a loss of engine 
power on initial climb.  The private pilot received minor injuries, and the passenger was not 
injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local, personal flight.  No flight plan 
was filed for the flight conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.  
     The pilot stated that during the water takeoff roll, the airplane bounced several times as it 
maneuvered through waves and boat wakes.  After becoming airborne, about 10 feet, the 
engine lost total power.  The pilot nosed the airplane over toward the water, and it impacted 
the water in a nose down attitude.  
     The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector examined the airplane and noted that 
the fuselage was buckled.  The FAA Inspector stated:
     ...A cursory inspection was performed on the...engine.       A visual inspection was made and 
nothing abnormal was      noted.  The engine would rotate....Compression was      obtained on 
all...cylinders and continuity was      confirmed through the engine.  The fuel filter was free      
of any contamination and residual fuel was noted.  The      fuel line at the flow divider was 
removed and residual      fuel was noted.  An operation check of the engine was      made and 
nothing abnormal was noted.
