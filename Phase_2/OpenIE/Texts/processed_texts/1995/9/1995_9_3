WITNESSES REPORTED THAT THE AIRPLANE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE CLIMBING 
NORMALLY AFTER TAKEOFF. THE PILOT RECALLED TURNING 'BACK TOWARDS THE 
RUNWAY.'  THE PILOT-RATED PASSENGER RECALLED THERE HAD BEEN A POWER 
LOSS 'AS IF THE POWER HAD BEEN BROUGHT BACK TO IDLE.'  SUBSEQUENTLY, THE 
LEFT WING DROPPED, AND THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH TERRAIN. THE MIXTURE 
CONTROL WAS FOUND IN THE FULL RICH POSITION. A 4 INCH BY 3/8 INCH PIECE OF 
BAFFLE SEAL MATERIAL WAS FOUND NEXT TO THE VENTURI IN THE AIR INTAKE 
SIDE OF THE CARBURETOR THROAT, LODGED BETWEEN THE ACCELERATOR PUMP 
DISCHARGE TUBE AND THE POWER JET. THE UNDISTURBED CARBURETOR WAS 
FACTORY TESTED ON A SIMILAR ENGINE. THE ENGINE OPERATED 'EXTREMELY 
RICH.' ONE PILOT WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY FLOWN THE AIRPLANE SAID THE ENGINE 
DID NOT DEVELOP FULL POWER. ANOTHER PILOT-INSTRUCTOR SAID HE NOTICED 
THE ENGINE REQUIRED 'MORE LEANING' THAN OTHER CESSNA 172S HE HAD 
FLOWN. ELEVATION AT THE AIRPORT WAS 6172 FEET. 
BLOCKAGE OF THE CARBURETOR BY A PIECE OF FOREIGN MATERIAL, WHICH 
RESULTED IN A LOSS OF ENGINE POWER, AND FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN 
AIRSPEED, WHICH RESULTED IN AN INADVERTENT STALL.  THE HIGH DENSITY 
ALTITUDE AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO PROPERLY LEAN THE FUEL MIXTURE WERE 
POSSIBLE FACTORS. 
 On September 1, 1995, at 0737 mountain daylight time, a Cessna 172N, N4814F, was destroyed 
when it collided with terrain after taking off from Colorado Springs, Colorado.  The commercial 
pilot and passenger were seriously injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no 
flight plan was filed for the personal flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  The 
flight was originating when the accident occurred.
In the Pilot/Operator Report, the pilot could not recall any of the accident details other than 
having initiated a left turn "back towards the runway."  The pilot's father recalled that there 
had been a power loss, "as if the power had been brought back to idle."  Control tower 
personnel observed the airplane take off on runway 35L, but it did not appear to be climbing.  
They asked the pilot if he was having difficulty or if he wanted to land.  The pilot said he did not 
need any help.  The left wing was then seen to drop and the airplane collided with terrain.
The on-scene examination by a Federal Aviation Administration operations inspector disclosed 
the mixture control was in the "FULL RICH" position.  A piece of baffle seal material, 
measuring approximately 4 inches by 3/8 inch was found lodged upstream from the venturi in 
the air intake side of the carburetor throat, between the accelerator pump discharge tube and 
the power jet.  A similar piece of material was found missing from the carburetor heat air box.  
The elevation at Colorado Springs Municipal Airport is 6,172 feet above mean sea level (MSL).
The undisturbed carburetor and carburetor heat air box were sent to Textron-Lycoming to be 
functionally tested.  According to Textron-Lycoming's report, the baffle seal material 
obstructed air flow to the fuel discharge nozzle in the middle of the venturi.  Although the 
accident engine was an O-320-H2AD, for test purposes the carburetor was mounted on a O-
320-D3G engine.  According to a Textron-Lycoming spokesman, there are internal differences 
between the two engines, but the test curves are the same.  The engine was started and, 
according to one test engineer, operated "extremely rich."  When the mixture was leaned, 
approximately 90 percent power (2,664 RPM) was attained.  Full power (an air flow of 900 
pounds per hour) could not be achieved due to the obstruction.  Elevation at Williamsport, 
Pennsylvania, the test site, is approximately 529 feet MSL.
A flight instructor, who was the last person to fly N4814F, said the airplane and engine 
operated normally for him on the day before the accident.  The instructor, who owns a Cessna 
172, said he had noticed that N4814F required "more leaning" than other Cessna 172s he has 
flown.
One renter pilot, who had flown N4814F two weeks before the accident, stated that he made a 
night takeoff from Colorado Springs en route to Englewood, Colorado, and noticed the engine 
noise was "low" and the rate of climb was between 200 and 250 feet per minute (fpm).  When 
he prepared to depart Englewood for the return trip, he performed an "extended" engine runup 
and made sure the mixture control was set properly and everything checked "normal."  After 
takeoff and at an altitude of 15 to 20 feet above the ground, the airplane settled back towards 
the runway.  The pilot was able to fly in ground effect until the airspeed increased.  The 
airplane then climbed out at 100 fpm.  He reported this to the operator the next morning, and 
the operator performed a cylinder compression check, finding nothing amiss, he returned the 
airplane to service.
