THE PILOT WAS LANDING ON A LAKE IN A FLOAT EQUIPPED AIRPLANE AND WAS 
PERFORMING A CURVING APPROACH TO GLASSY WATER. DURING THE LANDING 
APPROACH, THE AIRPLANE DEVELOPED A HIGH RATE OF DESCENT. JUST BEFORE 
TOUCHDOWN, THE PILOT ADDED ENGINE POWER, BUT THE AIRPLANE LANDED 
HARD ON THE WATER. THE AIRPLANE RECEIVED DAMAGE TO THE LEFT FLOAT, LEFT 
FLOAT STRUT, AND FUSELAGE. 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN A PROPER RATE OF DESCENT DURING THE 
APPROACH TO LAND, AND HIS MISJUDGMENT OF ALTITUDE TO FLARE FOR LANDING 
ON GLASSY WATER.  THE GLASSY WATER CONDITION WAS A RELATED FACTOR. 
 On September 2, 1995, about 1530 Alaska daylight time, a float  equipped Champion 7GCBC, 
N9033L, crashed during landing on a lake, about 6 miles southwest of Big Lake, Alaska.  The 
airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) local area personal flight when the 
accident occurred.  The airplane, owned and operated by the pilot, sustained substantial 
damage.  The certificated commercial pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed.  The flight originated at the Lake Hood Seaplane base, 
Anchorage, Alaska, about 1500.
The pilot reported that he was landing on 7 Mile Lake in a northeasterly direction and was 
performing a curving approach to glassy water.  During the landing approach, the airplane 
developed a high rate of descent.  Just before touchdown, the pilot added engine power but the 
airplane experienced a hard landing on the water.  The airplane received damage to the left 
float, left float strut, and fuselage.
