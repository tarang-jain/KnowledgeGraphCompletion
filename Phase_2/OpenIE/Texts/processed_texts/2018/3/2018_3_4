The solo student pilot reported that, during approach, he was above the glideslope after adding 
full flaps, so he lowered the nose to lose altitude. He added that he "brought a little more speed 
than intended" into ground effect and the airplane yawed to the left. He overcorrected to the 
right. The airplane touched down to the right of the runway centerline with the nose pointed 
45° to the left. The student attempted to maintain directional control, but the airplane exited 
the runway to the right and the right wing struck a runway sign. The student pilot taxied back 
onto the runway and to the parking ramp without further incident.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The chief flight instructor of the flight school reported that there were no preaccident 
mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal 
operation.
The automated weather observation station located on the airport reported that, about 37 
minutes before the accident, the wind was from 360° at 6 knots. The same automated station 
reported that, about 23 minutes after the accident, the wind was from 030° at 11 knots, gusting 
to 17 knots. The airplane landed on runway 04.
The student pilot's failure to maintain a stabilized approach, which resulted in overcorrection 
with the rudder during the landing, loss of control, and a runway excursion.
