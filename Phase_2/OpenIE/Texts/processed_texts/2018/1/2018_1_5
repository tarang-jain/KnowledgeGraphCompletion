The pilot and two medical crewmembers were on a return flight to a hospital helipad. During 
the approach to the helipad, the crew heard a noise outside the helicopter. The medical 
crewmembers reported they felt a slight "shudder" on the helicopter but attributed it to the 
wind as they approached the helipad. The pilot heard the noise, but there was no effect on the 
controls or flight characteristics, so he continued the landing without further incident. After 
engine shutdown, the oncoming pilot noticed that the helicopter's tail rotor drive shaft cover 
was missing. The surrounding area near the helicopter's approach path was searched, and the 
missing cover was found.
An examination of the helicopter noted substantial damage to the tail rotor drive shaft.
The day before the accident, scheduled maintenance was performed on the helicopter's tail 
rotor pitch change mechanism, which required removal of the drive shaft cover. The cover was 
reinstalled, and no problems were reported during a subsequent preflight inspection.
It is likely that maintenance personnel did not properly secure the cover fasteners after the 
cover was reinstalled.
Maintenance personnel's failure to properly secure the tail rotor drive shaft cover, which 
resulted in the cover departing the helicopter in flight.
