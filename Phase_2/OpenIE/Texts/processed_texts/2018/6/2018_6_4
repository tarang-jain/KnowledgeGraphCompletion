The pilot reported that, during approach to the ocean bay, the float-equipped airplane 
encountered very light turbulence. The touchdown was normal, but seconds later he "felt" a 
strong wind on the airplane's tail from the left that lifted the tail. The front of the right float 
submerged, and he immediately "pulled back and left" on the controls with no response. 
Subsequently, the right float struts collapsed, and the right wing impacted the water, the 
airplane spun about 90° to 120° to the right, the left wing impacted the water, and the airplane 
came to rest upright on the floats.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
An automated weather observation system about 20 nautical miles from the accident site 
reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 160° at 9 knots. The pilot 
landed to the south.
