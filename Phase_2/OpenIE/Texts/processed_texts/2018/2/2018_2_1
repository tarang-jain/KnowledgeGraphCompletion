The helicopter pilot selected a landing site on a ridge above 8,000 ft mean sea level and 
initiated an approach. 
The helicopter descended below effective translational lift airspeed, and the pilot turned the 
nose of the helicopter to the right. The helicopter developed a rapid right yaw, and he applied 
full left pedal to arrest the yaw and forward cyclic to fly out of the condition, but the main rotor 
blades struck the ground. The helicopter came to rest on its left side, and sustained substantial 
damage to the fuselage, the tailboom and both rotor systems. 
The pilot reported that the maximum gross weight of the helicopter was 3,000 pounds, and the 
weight of the helicopter at the time of the accident was 2,700 pounds.
According to the recommendation section of the National Transportation Safety Board pilot's 
aircraft accident report, the pilot reported that the accident could have been prevented if the 
helicopter wasn't so heavy. Additionally, he noted that he should have selected a better landing 
area with the landing direction into the wind. 
Per the Federal Aviation Administration 
Helicopter Flying Handbook
 pg. 11-20, "Loss of Tail 
Rotor Effectiveness [LTE]," when operating at high altitudes and high gross weights, especially 
while hovering, the tail rotor thrust may not be sufficient to maintain directional control, and 
LTE can occur. In this case, the hovering ceiling is limited by tail rotor thrust and not 
necessarily power available.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
helicopter that would have precluded normal operation. 
The pilot's high altitude, high gross weight landing with insufficient tail rotor thrust resulting 
in a loss of tail rotor effectiveness.
