The pilot reported that, during landing, she became distracted by another airplane performing 
a touch-and-go, and upon touchdown, the airplane veered to the right. She added full power to 
go around, but the airplane continued to the right as it became airborne, and the right wing 
struck a parked helicopter. Subsequently, the airplane impacted the tops of bushes and came to 
rest inverted in an adjacent riverbed.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing due to being distracted by 
another airplane and her delayed initiation of a go-around, during which the right wing struck 
a parked helicopter.
