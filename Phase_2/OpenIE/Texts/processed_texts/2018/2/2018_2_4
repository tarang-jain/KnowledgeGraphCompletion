The pilot reported that, en route, he noticed a drop in the engine's rpm. He noted that the fuel 
shutoff valve was open, and the gas gauges showed half full in the right tank and quarter full in 
the left tank. He added that the carburetor heat was off, the mixture was full rich, and then the 
engine quit running. During the third attempt to restart the engine, it briefly started and then 
quit again. Subsequently, during an off-airport landing in a field, the airplane nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the empennage and fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation. He added that he had filled the gas "to 
the top" (22.5 gallons) before departure and had flown for 3.7 hours. The 1969 Cessna 150 
owner's manual states that the airplane's maximum range was 4.1 hours with no reserve at 75% 
power at 7,000 ft. 
The pilot further reported in a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety 
Board investigator-in-charge that he did not consult the emergency checklist because it was 
placed in the glovebox. 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspectors drained the fuel tanks about 5 days after the 
accident and reported that there was no evidence of fuel leakage around the fuel caps or on the 
ground. They drained about 8 to 12 ounces from the left wing tank and about 3/4 of a gallon 
from the right wing tank. The FAA inspectors added that the engine showed proper continuity, 
and the magnetos were operational. The engine was not run due to a fractured intake manifold 
just above the carburetor base flange. The fracture damage to the intake manifold was 
consistent with impact damage.
The pilot's improper fuel planning, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel 
exhaustion and a subsequent off-airport landing and nose-over.
