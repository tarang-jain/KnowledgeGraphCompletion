THE INSTRUCTOR PILOT (CFI) ELECTED TO DEMONSTRATE A SOFT FIELD LANDING AT 
AN UNIMPROVED RANCH STRIP.  AS HE WAS ABOUT TO LAND, HE SAW MOUNDS OF 
SOFT DIRT ON THE STRIP AND INCREASED POWER TO 'CARRY THE GLIDE BEYOND 
THEM.'  SUBSEQUENTLY, HE REALIZED THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT RUNWAY REMAINING 
TO COMPLETE THE LANDING, SO HE INITIATED A GO-AROUND. HE APPLIED FULL 
POWER AND RAISED THE AIRCRAFT'S NOSE TO CLEAR A FENCE, BUT THE AIRCRAFT LOST FLYING 
SPEED AND SETTLED INTO A FIELD BEYOND THE LANDING AREA. THE LANDING GEAR 
THEN HIT AN IRRIGATION PIPE AND WAS DAMAGED. 
A DELAY BY THE PILOT IN ABORTING THE LANDING AND HIS FAILURE TO ASSURE 
SUFFICIENT AIRSPEED FOR THE GO-AROUND (ABORTED LANDING).  A FACTOR 
RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WAS:  THE UNSUITABLE LANDING AREA THAT WAS 
SELECTED BY THE PILOT.
