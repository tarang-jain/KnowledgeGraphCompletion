ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, WHEN HE ARRIVED IN THE AREA OF THE ARPT, HE 
CONTACTED THE FLIGHT SVC STATION (FSS) AND WAS ADVISED THAT RUNWAY 30 (A 9002' 
ASPHALT RUNWAY) WAS ACTIVE AND THAT THE WIND WAS FROM 210 DEG AT 10, GUSTING 
15 KTS. THE ARPT ALSO HAD A TURF RUNWAY (RUNWAY 3/21) WHICH WAS 3400' LONG. THE 
PILOT STATED THAT DRG TOUCHED DOWN ON RUNWAY 30, A GUST OF WIND LIFTED THE 
LEFT WING AND THE AIRCRAFT VEERED OFF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY. HE APPLIED 
POWER, BUT THE RIGHT WING HIT THE GROUND AND THE AIRCRAFT CARTWHEELED. 
SHORTLY AFTER COMING TO REST, IT BEGAN BURNING AND WAS DESTROYED BY FIRE. 
IMPROPER IN-FLIGHT PLANNING/DECISION BY THE PILOT WHICH LED TO HIS 
FAILURE TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL DURING THE LANDING. 
CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE: USE OF AN UNFAVORABLE RUNWAY, CROSSWIND, 
AND GUSTS.
