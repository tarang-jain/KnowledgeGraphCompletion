THE AIRPLANE LANDED WITH THE RIGHT MAIN LANDING GEAR NOT FULLY DOWN 
AND LOCKED. WHEN THE AIRPLANE TOUCHED DOWN, THE LANDING GEAR WOULD 
NOT SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF THE AIRPLANE AND IT COLLAPSED. THE AIRPLANE 
SUSTAINED MINOR DAMAGE AND NEITHER OF THE TWO CREWMEMBERS ABOARD 
THE AIRPLANE WERE INJURED. THE LANDING GEAR MALFUNCTION HAD BEEN 
DISCOVERED WHEN THE LANDING GEAR WOULD NOT CYCLE PROPERLY DURING A 
MAINTENANCE CHECK FLIGHT. WHEN THE FLIGHT CREW ATTEMPTED TO LOWER 
THE LANDING GEAR AFTER RETRACTION, THE RIGHT MAIN LANDING GEAR WOULD 
NOT FULLY EXTEND. ATTEMPTS TO EXTEND THE LANDING GEAR USING EMERGENCY 
PROCEDURES WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL. 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
MATERIAL FAILURE OF THE LANDING GEAR RETRACTION AND EXTENSION 
ASSEMBLY. INADEQUATE MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURES IN 
COMPANY DIRECTIVES WERE FACTORS IN THIS INCIDENT.
