THE FLIGHT CREW REPORTED THAT WHILE IN CRUISE FLIGHT AT 33,000 FEET, THEY 
EXPERIENCED A HYDRAULIC SYSTEM FAILURE. THEY MANUALLY EXTENDED THE 
LANDING GEAR FOR LANDING AND MADE AN UNEVENTFUL NO FLAPS/NO SLATS 
LANDING. POST-ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE LOSS OF 
HYDRAULIC PRESSURE IN BOTH SYSTEMS WAS DUE TO THE FAILURE OF PTU S/O 
VALVE BODY ATTACH SCREWS ON THE LEFT SYSTEM VALVE. THIS ALLOWED THE 
LEFT VALVE BODY TO SEPERATE FROM THE REMAINING ASSEMBLY, PORTING LEFT 
SYSTEM HYDRAULIC FLUID OVERBOARD, AND SUBSEQUENTLY DEPRESSURIZING 
THE RIGHT SYSTEM (ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO LOSS OF RIGHT SYSTEM 
HYDRAULIC FLUID). THE MANUFACTURER HAD A RE-DESIGNED, STRONGER UNIT 
AVAILABLE TO OPERATORS; THIS IMPROVED UNIT HAD STRONGER VALVE BODY 
ATTACH SCREWS, WELDED VALVE BODIES, STEEL GEARS, AND A SHEAR PIN IN THE 
MOTOR-TO-VALVE GEAR TRAIN. 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
FAILURE OF THE HYDRAULIC POWER TRANSFER UNIT SHUT-OFF (PTU S/O) VALVE 
DUE TO FAILED (FATIGUED) VALVE BODY ATTACH SCREWS.
