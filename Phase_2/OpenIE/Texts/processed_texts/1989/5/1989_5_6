THE PVT PILOT WAS COMPLETING A X-COUNTRY FLIGHT WHEN THE ACCIDENT 
OCCURRED. HE SAID THAT HE HAD TO SWITCH RUNWAYS BECAUSE OF GUSTING 
AND VARIABLE WINDS. HE SELECTED RUNWAY 21, A 3,100 X 40 FEET ASPHALT RUNWAY. THE 
TOUCHDOWN SEEMED NORMAL BUT THE PILOT SAID HE HAD TO USE FULL RIGHT 
RUDDER THEN FULL LEFT RUDDER TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL. THE PILOT 
SAID THAT A SUDDEN GUST FROM THE LEFT AND REAR OF THE AIRCRAFT BLEW DUST 
AND WEEDS ACROSS THE RUNWAY AND LIFTED THE TAIL OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE AIRCRAFT CAME 
TO REST INVERTED AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE RUNWAY. 
INADEQUATE COMPENSATION FOR THE WIND CONDITIONS BY THE PILOT, 
RESULTING IN A LOSS OF CONTROL DURING LANDING ROLL. VARIABLE AND 
GUSTING WINDS ARE CONSIDERED A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR.
