THE STUDENT PILOT SAID THAT WHILE PRACTICING TAKE-OFFS AND LANDINGS IN LIGHT 
X-WIND CONDITIONS, HE DID NOT MAINTAIN RUNWAY ALIGNMENT DURING THE 
2ND LANDING. HE OVER-CORRECTED, FAILED TO REDUCE POWER TO IDLE, THEN 
APPLIED BRAKES. HE SAID HE PANICKED AND DECIDED TO 'RIDE IT OUT' RATHER THAN 
MAKE A GO-AROUND. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE AIRCRAFT WENT OFF THE RUNWAY, CROSSED A 
DITCH AND STOPPED WITH THE NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED.
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL.  FACTORS RELATED TO 
THE ACCIDENT WERE:  THE CROSSWIND, THE PILOT'S IMPROPER COMPENSATION 
FOR WIND CONDITIONS, HIS IMPROPER USE OF THE THROTTLE, AND THE DITCH.
