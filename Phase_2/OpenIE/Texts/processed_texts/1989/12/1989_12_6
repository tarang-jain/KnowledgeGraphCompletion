STRONG, GUSTY WINDS, A WIND GUST LIFTED THE LEFT WING AND PUSHED THE 
AIRCRAFT OVER, INVERTED. WIND AT THE AIRPORT WAS REPORTED TO BE FROM 
300 DEGREES AT 30 KNOTS, WITH GUSTS TO 40 KNOTS. THE PILOT HAD RECEIVED A 
PRELFIGHT WEATHER BRIEFING AND HAD OBTAINED WEATHER UPDATES AND EN 
ROUTE ADVISORIES THROUGHOUT THE CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT. ALL WEATHER 
SERVICES REPORTED HIGH SURFACE WINDS, INCREASING IN STRENGTH DURING 
THE DAY WITH GUSTS. 
IMPROPER PLANNING/DECISION BY THE PILOT,  WHICH RESULTED IN HIS INABILITY 
TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT.  A FACTOR RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT 
WAS:  THE ADVERSE WIND CONDITION.
