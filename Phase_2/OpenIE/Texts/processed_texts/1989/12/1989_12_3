BEFORE THE FLIGHT, A STUDENT PILOT INQUIRED IF HE COULD ACCOMPANY THE 
PILOT ON THE FLIGHT, AND THE PILOT CONSENTED. THE PILOT ADJUSTED THE 
THROTTLE AND BEGAN TO START THE ENGINE BY HAND-PROPPING IT. MEANWHILE, 
THE PASSENGER/STUDENT PILOT BOARDED THE TAYLORCRAFT. THE ENGINE 
STARTED, THE PLANE BEGAN MOVING FORWARD, AND THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO 
ARREST ITS MOVEMENT BY GRABBING THE LEFT WING STRUT. THE PLANE THEN 
PIVOTED AROUND THE PILOT AND COLLIDED WITH A PARKED AIRCRAFT. AN 
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE THROTTLE WAS EASY TO MOVE. THE PILOT AND AN 
FAA INSPECTOR CONCLUDED THAT THE PASSENGER/STUDENT PILOT MUST HAVE 
'BUMPED' THE THROTTLE AS HE ENTERED THE COCKPIT. 
FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO PROPERLY SECURE THE AIRCRAFT AND/OR ADEQUATELY 
BRIEF THE PASSENGER (STUDENT PILOT), AND INADVERTENT BUMPING OF THE 
THROTTLE BY THE PASSENGER.
