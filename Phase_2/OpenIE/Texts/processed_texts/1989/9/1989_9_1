DURING TAKEOFF FROM A GRAVEL BAR, THE AIRPLANE STRUCK A PLASTIC BUCKET 
THAT WAS BLOWN INTO ITS PATH BY A CROSSWIND. THE BUCKET STRUCK THE LEFT 
HORIZONTAL STABILIZER AS THE AIRPLANE WAS ABOUT TO LIFT-OFF. THE PILOT 
CONTINUED THE FLIGHT WITH NO DIFFICULTY, BUT AFTER LANDING, AN EXAM OF 
THE STABILIZER REVEALED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. 
THE BUCKET WHICH WAS BLOWN INTO THE FLIGHT PATH BY A CROSSWIND.
