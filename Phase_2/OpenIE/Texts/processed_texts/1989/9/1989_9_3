UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ALTITUDE, THE PILOT ELECTED TO LAND ON AN ACCESS 
ROAD. THE LANDING WAS UNEVENTFUL, BUT DURING THE LANDING ROLL-OUT, 
THE LEFT WHEEL PANT STRUCK A ROAD MARKER. THE AIRPLANE THEN YAWED TO 
THE LEFT, EXITED THE ROADWAY, AND WENT THRU A BARBED WIRE FENCE AND 
ONTO A DIRT FIELD. AN ENGINE EXAMINATION DISCLOSED THE #2 PISTON WAS 
DESTROYED. THE PISTON WAS NOT IDENTIFIED AS BEING THE CORRECT ONE FOR 
THE ENGINE. THE ENGINE HAD ACCRUED 145 HOURS SINCE MAJOR OVERHAUL. THE 
OVERHAUL WAS PERFORMED BY AN AANDP MECHANIC. 
FAILURE OF THE #2 PISTON.  FAILURE OF THE MECHANIC TO PROPERLY OVERHAUL 
THE ENGINE WAS A RELATED FACTOR.
