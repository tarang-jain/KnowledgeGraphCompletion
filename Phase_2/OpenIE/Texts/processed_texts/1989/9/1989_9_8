ACCORDING TO THE CAPTAIN, HE WAS TAXIING THE AIRCRAFT TO BE PARKED AND 
WAS BEING GUIDED TO THE PARKING AREA BY A GROUND GUIDE. THE GUIDE 
TURNED THE AIRCRAFT TOO CLOSE TO THE JETWAY AND THE VERTICAL STABILIZER 
CONTACTED THE JETWAY. 
THE FAILURE OF THE GROUND PERSONNEL TO SAFELY GUIDE THE AIRCRAFT SO 
THAT IT WOULD HAVE CLEARED THE JETWAY.
