THE PILOT AND HIS WIFE WERE MAKING A X-COUNTRY FLIGHT.  RPRTDLY, WHEN HE 
LANDED, THE WIND WAS VARIABLE FROM 270 TO 300 DEG AT 10 TO 15 KTS WITH 
GUSTS TO 20 KTS.  THE PILOT SAID THAT AT TOUCHDOWN, THE PLANE ENCOUNTERED 
A WIND GUST AND LANDED HARD.  HE SAID HE MADE A GO-AROUND AND LANDED 
ON RUNWAY 3 WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.  AFTER LANDING, HE FOUND A WRINKLE 
IN THE FUSELAGE AND AN AANDP MECHANIC DISCOVERED DAMAGE TO THE 
FIREWALL.  DENSITY ALT WAS ABOUT 7500 FEET AT THE ARPT. 
INADEQUATE COMPENSATION FOR THE WIND CONDITIONS BY THE PILOT, AND HIS 
FAILURE TO ATTAIN A FLARE.  THE UNFAVORABLE (VARIABLE AND GUSTY) WIND 
CONDITION WAS A RELATED FACTOR.
