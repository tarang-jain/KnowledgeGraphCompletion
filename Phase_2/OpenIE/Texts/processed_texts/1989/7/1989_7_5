THE AIRCRAFEET WAS AIR TAXIING AT 2 FEET AGL WHEN THE INSTRUCTOR CUT THE POWER 
TO SIMULATE A POWER LOSS. ACCORDING TO THE STUDENT AND INSTRUCTOR, A 
NORMAL LANDING FOLLOWED; HOWEVER, THE AIRCRAFT NOSED OVER. UPON EXITING 
THE AIRCRAFT THEY NOTICED THEY HAD LANDED ON A DIRT MOUNT AND THE LEFT 
LANDING SKID HAD FAILED. 
THE PILOT LANDED ON UNSUITABLE SOFT TERRAIN WHICH CAUSED THE LANDING 
SKID TO SINK INTO THE GROUND. THIS RESULTED IN A LANDING SKID OVERLOAD 
FAILURE AND NOSE OVER OF THE HELICOPTER. CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT 
WAS THE SOFT TERRAIN.
