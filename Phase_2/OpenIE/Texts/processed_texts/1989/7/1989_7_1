THE PILOT INITIALLY LANDED AT AN ARPT TO OBTAIN FUEL; HOWEVER, THE PUMPS 
HAD BEEN CLOSED DOWN FOR THE NIGHT AND FUEL WAS NOT AVAILABLE. HE 
DEPARTED THE ARPT AND ELECTED TO LAND AT A CONVENIENCE STORE WHICH HAD 
FUEL PUMPS. DRG A LANDING AT NIGHT, THE HELICOPTER CONTACTED THE 
WOODEN FRAMED CANOPY STRUCTURE WHICH COVERED THE FUEL PUMPS. 
SUBSEQUENTLY, THE PILOT LOST CONTROL OF THE HELICOPTER AND IT DESCENDED AND 
IMPACTED THE PAVEMENT. ABOUT 1 HR AFTER THE ACDNT, THE STATE POLICE 
ADMINISTERED A BREATHALYZER TEST, WHICH SHOWED THE PILOT HAD AN 
ALCOHOL LEVEL OF APPROXIMATELY 0.13%. 
POOR JUDGEMENT OF THE PILOT BY FLYING, WHILE PHYSICALLY IMPAIRED BY 
ALCOHOL, AND HIS MISJUDGEMENT OF CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE HELICOPTER 
AND THE STRUCTURE.  THE DARK NIGHT AND OBJECT (STRUCTURE) WERE 
CONSIDERED TO BE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS.
