THE GLIDER FLIGHT WAS RETURNING TO THE AIRPORT AFTER COMPLETING A 
LOCAL SOARING FLIGHT. THE GLIDER'S ALTITUDE WAS TOO LOW TO EXECUTE A 
NORMAL DOWNWIND PATTERN ENTRY AND THE PILOT ELECTED TO ENTER THE 
BASE LEG. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE BASE LEG ENTRY ALTITUDE WAS ABT 200 - 
300 FEET ABOVE THE NORMAL BASE LEG ALTITUDE AND THAT THE GLIDER LANDED 
LONG AND RAN OFF THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY. THE PILOT ELECTED TO 
GROUND LOOP THE AIRPLANE TO AVOID COLLIDING WITH A FENCE AFTER THE 
GLIDER EXITED THE RUNWAY ENVIRONMENT. 
PILOT MISJUDGED THE AIRPLANE'S ALTITUDE AND FAILED TO EXTEND THE 
SPOILERS.
