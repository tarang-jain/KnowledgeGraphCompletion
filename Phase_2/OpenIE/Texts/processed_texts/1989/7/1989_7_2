THE PILOT WAS ON CLIMB OUT, AT 200 FEET AGL, AFEETER DOING THE THIRD T AND G LNDG, 
WHEN THE ENG STARTED LOSING PWR. THE PILOT MADE A FORCED LNDG IN AN OPEN 
FIELD AND THE AIRCRAFT STRUCK A POLE AND TREE. THE PILOT SAID HE PUT THE AIRCRAFT IN 
A LEFT SLIP DURING THE THIRD LNDG APPROACH AND WAS USING THE LEFT FUEL 
TANK DURING THE FLIGHT. EXAMINATION OF THE AIRCRAFT REVEALED THE FUEL 
TANKS EACH HAD 5 GALS OF FUEL. EACH TANK CAPACITY IS 12.5 GALS. THE ENG 
STARTED ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT AND OPERATED WITHOUT DISCREPANCY DURING 
THE POST ACCIDENT EXAMINATION. 
THE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER BECAUSE OF FUEL STARVATION. FUEL STARVATION 
OCCURRED BECAUSE OF UNPORTING OF FUEL FROM THE TANK OUTLET WHEN THE 
AIRCRAFT WAS IN A SLIP ATTITUDE SHORTLY BEFORE THE POWER LOSS. A 
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IS INADEQUATE INFORMATION IN THE FLIGHT MANUAL 
CAUTIONING OF THE POTENTIAL UNPORTING OF THE FUEL OUTLET.
