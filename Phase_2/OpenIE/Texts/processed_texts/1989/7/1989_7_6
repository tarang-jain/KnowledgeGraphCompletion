THE PILOT RPRTD THAT AS HE WAS LANDING, THE AIRPLANE ENCOUNTERED A 
STRONG GUST OF WIND WHICH BLEW IT TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY. DENSITY 
ALTITUDE AT THE ARPT WAS 11,600 FT. THE PILOT ATTEMPTED A GO-AROUND, BUT 
WAS UNABLE TO GET THE AIRCRAFT TO CLEAR OVER TREES. THE AIRCRAFT THEN CRASHED 
TO THE GROUND AND CAME TO REST INVERTED WITH ITS TAIL AND LEFT WING TORN OFF. 
THE FIXED BASE OPERATOR AT THE ARPT ESTIMATED THE WIND WAS FROM 240 
DEG AT 7 KTS. THE ARPT DIRECTORY RECOMMENDED THAT LANDINGS BE MADE ON 
RUNWAY 9 AND TAKEOFFS BE MADE ON RUNWAY 27 FOR NOISE ABATEMENT REASONS. LOCAL 
PILOTS RPRTD THAT SUDDEN STRONG GUSTS ARE OFTEN ENCOUNTERED DRG 
LANDINGS AT THIS ARPT. A PILOT, WHO LANDED JUST AFTER THE ACDNT, ALSO 
ENCOUNTERED UNFAVORABLE WIND NEAR THE APPROACH END OF RUNWAY 9. 
INADEQUATE COMPENSATION FOR WIND CONDITIONS BY THE PILOT AND HIS 
FAILURE TO MAINTAIN RUNWAY ALIGNMENT. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE WIND 
CONDITIONS, HIGH DENSITY ALTITUDE, AND TREES.
