THE AIRPLANE STALLED AND CRASHED SHORTLY AFTER A DOWNWIND TOUCH AND GO 
LDG. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE DID NOT CHECK THE ARPT WINDSOCK PRIOR TO 
THE LDG. THE AIRPLANE TOUCHED DOWN ABOUT 1/3 DOWN THE 3,500 FEET RUNWAY 
WITH FULL FLAPS (40 DEGREES). THE PILOT THEN INITIATED T/O BY FIRST ADDING 
POWER. BEFORE HE COULD RAISE THE FLAPS THE AIRPLANE BECAME AIRBORNE AND 
CLIMBED TO ABOUT 100 FT. HE THEN ELECTED TO LEAVE THE FLAPS DOWN 
BECAUSE OF LOW AIRSPEED AND THE POSSIBILITY OF STALLING. THE AIRPLANE 
BEGAN TO DESCEND, AND SUBSEQUENTLY IMPACTED THE GROUND WITH THE RIGHT 
MAIN AND NOSE LDG GEAR ABOUT 300 YDS SOUTH OF THE ARPT. A WITNESS REPORTED 
THAT THE AIRPLANE MAINTAINED A HIGH ANGLE OF ATTACK AS IT DESCENDED. 
THE PILOT NOTED THAT THE WIND HAD BEEN BLOWING FROM THE OPPOSITE 
DIRECTION EARLIER IN THE FLIGHT. 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO RETRACT THE FLAPS PRIOR TO ADDING POWER FOR 
TAKEOFF RESULTING IN A PREMATURE LIFT-OFF, AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO 
MAINTIAN CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE AFTER LIFT-OFF WHICH RESULTED IN A 
STALL/MUSH.
