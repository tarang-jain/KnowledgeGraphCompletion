DURING A LOCAL TEST FLIGHT, THE PILOT LOST CONTROL OF THE HALF-SCALE P-51 
AIRPLANE WHILE TURNING FROM DOWNWIND TO BASE. THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED 
WITH THE TERRAIN SHORT OF THE RUNWAY. INSPECTION OF THE AIRPLANE 
REVEALED THAT THE AILERON CONTROL BELLCRANK WAS NOT INSTALLED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH RECORDS HELD BY THE PILOT/MANUFACTURER. WITNESSES 
REPORTED SEEING BOTH AILERONS AND THE WINGS FLUTTERING BEFORE THE 
CRASH. EVIDENCE INDICATED AILERON OVERTRAVEL. THE COCKPIT CONTROL 
STICK WAS NOT EQUIPPED WITH CONTROL TRAVEL STOPS. 
THE IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF THE AILERON CONTROLS OF THIS HOMEBUILT 
AIRCRAFT BY THE PILOT/MANUFACTURER WHICH LED TO THE INFLIGHT LOSS OF 
CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE. CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT'S 
INEXPERIENCE IN THE AIRPLANE.
