SAN ANGELO, TX. HE CONTINUED INTO DETERIORATING WX CONDITIONS. 
SUBSEQUENTLY, WHILE CRUISING BELOW THE CLOUDS, THE AIRCRAFT IMPACTED 
TERRAIN AT AN ELEV OF ABOUT 2500' MSL. IN A WRITTEN STATEMENT, THE PILOT 
STATED THAT HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO MAINTAIN 3500' MSL AND ENCOUNTERED 
STRONG DOWNDRAFTS. HOWEVER, IN EARLIER CONVERSATIONS WITH AN FAA 
COORDINATOR, HE INDICATED HE WAS TRYING TO MAINTAIN A LOWER ALTITUDE 
(APRX 200' AGL). RPRTDLY, IMPACT OCCURRED AS THE AIRCRAFT WAS FLYING AT ABOUT 
90 KTS. 
FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE ALTITUDE DURING CONTINUED 
FLIGHT INTO KNOWN ADVERSE WEATHER. THE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND DARK 
NIGHT WERE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS.
