SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF WHILE IN CRUISE AT 3,000 FEET A LOSS OF ENG POWER 
WAS EXPERIENCED. AN OFF AIRPORT FORCED LANDING WAS ATTEMPTED DURING 
WHICH THE AIRCRAFT CONTACTED TREES. THE ENG WAS TEST RUN SATISFACTORILY 
DURING POST ACCIDENT EXAM. THE FUEL SELECTOR WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE 
TWO TANK POSITIONS (FUEL WOULD NOT FLOW IN THIS POSITION), THE AUX BOOST 
PUMP WAS OFF AND FUEL WAS PRESENT IN BOTH TANKS. IN ADDITION, A WITNESS 
INDICATED THAT THE PILOT DID NOT CONDUCT A PREFLIGHT EXAM OF THE AIRCRAFT 
PRIOR TO TAKEOFF. 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO ASSURE THE FUEL SELECTOR WAS PROPERLY POSITIONED 
WHICH RESULTED IN FUEL STARVATION AND THE SUBSEQUENT FORCED LANDING.
