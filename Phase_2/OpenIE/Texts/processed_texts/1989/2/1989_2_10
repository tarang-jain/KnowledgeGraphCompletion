ON FINAL APPROACH AFTER A TRNG FLIGHT, AN AIRCRAFT WAS STILL ON THE RUNWAY, SO CFI TOLD 
30 HR STUDENT PILOT TO GO-ARND. POWER WAS APPLIED AND WITNESSES ON GRND 
HEARD ENG REV UP OK. ABOUT 1/2 WAY DOWN RUNWAY AT ABOUT 200 FT, THE ENG 
SPUTTERED AND CFI TRIED A 180 DEG TURN BACK TO RUNWAY. AIRCRAFT HIT FENCES AND 
CONST MATERIAL AND BURST INTO FLAMES. FUEL SEL WAS FOUND OUT OF DETENT 
BUT ON LT TANK WHICH HOLDS 30 GALS, 26 GALS USABLE. THE AIRCRAFT BURNS ABOUT 
8 GPH AND HAD FLOWN FOR A TOTAL OF ABOUT 4 HRS SINCE TOPPED OFF TO 60 GALS 
CAPACITY. NO FUEL FOUND IN FUEL MANIFOLD AND ENG WAS TEST RUN OK AFTER 
ACCIDENT. LT WING TANK AREA HAD LESS FIRE DAMAGE THAN RIGHT WING AREA 
WHICH CONTAINED MORE FUEL. THE STU PILOT RECALLED THE FUEL SEL BEING ON 
THE LT TANK; THE CFI SAID HE THOUGHT IT WAS ON THE RIGHT TANK. THE CFI STATED 
THAT HE HAD NO RECOLLECTION AFTER THE ENG QUIT EXCEPT BEING IN A 
CHOPPER ON THE WAY TO A HOSPITAL. 
FUEL STARVATION DUE TO THE CFI DEPLETING THE FUEL SUPPLY FROM ONE OF 
TWO TANKS AND FAILING TO SELECT THE FULLEST TANK FOR LANDING. 
CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE CFI'S IMPROPER DECISION TO TURN 
BACK TO THE AIRPORT WHEN INSUFFICIENT ALTITUDE WAS AVAILABLE TO 
COMPLETE THE MANEUVER.
