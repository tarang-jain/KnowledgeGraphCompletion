THE AIRCRAFEET WAS CRUISING AT 8500 FEET WHEN IT EXPERIENCED AN INFLIGHT LOSS OF 
CONTROL. THE PILOT SAID THE AUTOPILOT PITCH TRIM RAN AWAY NOSE DOWN AND HE 
WAS UNABLE TO DISCONNECT THE AUTOPILOT PRIOR TO THE LOSS OF CONTROL. 
EXAM OF THE AIRCRAFT SHOWED THE LEFT ELEVATOR HORN WAS BENT DOWN AND THE 
RIGHT ELEVATOR HORN WAS BROKEN OFF. THE AUTOPILOT WAS EXAMINED AND ALL 
DISCONNECTS EXCEPT FOR THE ACCELEROMETER TEST FUNCTIONED PROPERLY. 
THE PITCH TRIM BOARD WAS FOUND IMPROPERLY INSTALLED IN THE AUTO PILOT AND 
DID NOT MAKE CONNECTION. WITH THE ALTITUDE HOLD ENGAGED, THE 
AUTOPILOT WOULD HOLD THE ELEVATOR POSITION AT TIME OF ENGAGEMENT AND 
TRIM TO KEEP THE FORCES NEUTRAL. IF THE AIRCRAFT SLOWED, IT WOULD LOSE 
ALTITUDE AND TRIM NOSE UP. RADAR DATA SHOWED THE AIRCRAFT STARTED TO SLOW, 
THEN DESCENDED FROM 8500 TO 8300 FT, THEN CLIMBED TO 8900 FT. THE AIRCRAFT 
THEN CAME DOWN VERY RAPIDLY TO 1700 FEET PRIOR TO A RECOVERY. RPRTDLY, THE 
PILOT DID NOT TEST THE AUTOPILOT BEFORE TAKEOFF.                                    .
FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN AIRSPEED AND CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT, 
AND HIS EXCEEDING THE DESIGN STRESS LIMITS OF THE AIRCRAFT. FACTORS 
RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: AUTOPILOT MALFUNCTION DUE TO IMPROPER 
INSTALLATION BY MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO 
PREFLIGHT THE AUTOPILOT BEFORE USING IT IN FLIGHT.
