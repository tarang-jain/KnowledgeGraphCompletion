TWA FLIGHT 806 (DC-9) WAS NW OF ARPT (FOR ILS RUNWAY 9 APCH) AS CONTINENTAL FLIGHT 
122 (DC-9) WAS SW OF ARPT FOR SAME APCH. BOTH WERE IN IMC, BEING VCTRD BY 
FINAL TRACON CTLR (WORKING 2 SECTORS AND CTLG 23 AIRCRAFT). AS FLIGHT 122 WAS APCHG 
LOCALIZER (LOC) AND HDG 060 DEG AT 3000' MSL, FLIGHT 806 WAS ABT 8 MI NW OF FLIGHT 122 
AND WAS CLRD TO INTERCEPT LOC. CTLR TMTD TO FLIGHT 122 'FOUR FM THE MARKER, 
MAINT 2000 UNTIL ESTABLISHED ON THE LOC, CLRD ILS RUNWAY 9 APCH, AND ARE YOU 
GOING THRU THE LOC TOO?' FLIGHT 122 REPLIED 'YES SIR, YOU NEVER TOLD US TO 
INTERCEPT.' CTLR THEN TOLD FLIGHT 122 'MAINT 3500 AND TURN LEFT 360,' MEANING TO 
TURN TO A HDG OF 360 DEG.  FLIGHT 122 THOUGHT CTLR WANTED A 360 DEG CIRCLING 
TURN AND BGN A RGT TURN. WHILE CIRCLING, FLIGHT 122 ASKED FOR A HDG TO ROLL OUT 
ON. CTLR SAID TO FLY HDG 230. CTLR THEN REALIZED THE 2 AIRCRAFT WERE 
CONVERGING.  HE TOLD FLIGHT 122 TO DCND TO 2000' AND TMTD FOR 'CONTINENTAL 806' 
TO MAINT 3500'. SINCE CTLR USED WRONG COMPANY DESIGNATOR, TWA FLIGHT 806 
DID NOT RESPOND. RADAR SHOWED THE 2 AIRCRAFT PASSED AT ABT 3100' WITH .079 MI 
SEPN. 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
FAILURE OF THE TRACON FINAL APPROACH CONTROLLER TO ASSURE RADAR 
SEPARATION BETWEEN THE AIRCRAFT. FACTORS RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: 
INADEQUATE SUPERVISION BY THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SUPERVISOR, EXCESSIVE WORKLOAD FOR 
THE CONTROLLER, UNCLEAR INSTRUCTIONS BY THE CONTROLLER, AND A 
MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL CLEARANCE BY THE FLIGHT CREW OF 
CONTINENTAL FLIGHT 122.
