THE UK CERTIFIED PRIVATE PILOT WAS FLYING A CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT WITH HIS 
UK PRIVATE RATED PASSENGER. ON FINAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 23, THE PILOT ADDED 
POWER TO ADJUST HIS RATE OF DESCENT. HE ADDED FULL POWER TO NO AVAIL, 
AND THE RATE OF DESCENT WAS STILL TOO RAPID. THE PILOT SAID HE PREPARED FOR 
AN OFF AIRPORT LANDING. THE PLANE UNDERSHOT THE RUNWAY AND IMPACTED WITH 
SNOW COVERED TERRAIN, 300 FEET SHORT OF RUNWAY 23. THE NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED 
AND THE WINGS WERE BENT, THE PLANE CAME TO REST 150 FEET SHORT OF THE RUNWAY. 
THE FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN THE PROPER DESCENT RATE ON FINAL 
APPROACH WHICH RESULTED IN A LANDING SHORT OF THE RUNWAY.
