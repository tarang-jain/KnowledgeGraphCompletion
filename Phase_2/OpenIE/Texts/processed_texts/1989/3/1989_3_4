DURING AN AERIAL APPLICATION FLIGHT, THE PILOT HAD JUST COMPLETED A 
SWATH RUN OVER A FIELD, WHEN THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH POWER LINES. 
HE SAID THAT AFTER MAKING THE SWATH RUN, HE LOOKED BACK OVER HIS 
SHOULDER TO OBSERVE THE FLAGGERS. WHEN HE LOOKED FORWARD AGAIN, THE 
AIRPLANE WAS ABOUT TO STRIKE THE WIRES. 
INADEQUATE VISUAL LOOKOUT BY THE PILOT, WHEN HE DIVERTED HIS ATTENTION.  
THE POWER LINE WAS A RELATED FACTOR.
