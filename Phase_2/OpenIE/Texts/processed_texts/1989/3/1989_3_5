THE CREW OF AN ALL CARGO FLIGHT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE OF THE LEFT 
ENGINE WHILE IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN AT THEIR DESTINATION. THEY RAISED 
THE LANDING GEAR BUT FAILED TO FEATHER THE LEFT PROPELLER AND FAILED TO 
TRIM THE AIRCRAFT. THE RESULTING SKID AND INCREASED DRAG MADE FURTHER 
FLIGHT IMPOSSIBLE. THE CREW ELECTED TO DITCH THE AIRCRAFT IN A LAGOON 
ABOUT 2 MILES SOUTHWEST OF THE AIRPORT. THE AIRCRAFT WAS NOT RECOVERED 
FROM THE LAGOON AND THEREFORE IT WAS NOT DETERMINED WHY THE LEFT 
ENGINE LOST POWER. 
THE FAILURE OF THE FLIGHT CREW TO FEATHER THE LEFT PROPELLER AND TRIM 
THE AIRCRAFT AFTER THE LEFT ENGINE STOPPED PRODUCING POWER FOR 
UNDETERMINED REASONS.
