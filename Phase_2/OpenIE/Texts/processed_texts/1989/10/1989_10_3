AFTER TAKING OFF, THE PILOT ESTABLISHED RADIO CONTACT WITH DEP CTL AND RPRTD 
A DIRECTIONAL GYRO PROBLEM. SECONDS LATER, HE RPRTD THAT HE WAS LOSING 
ALL INSTRUMENTS. DEP CTL ATTEMPTED TO PROVIDE NO-GYRO VECTORS. THE PILOT 
WAS INSTRUCTED TO MAKE A FREQ CHANGE. SOON THEREAFTER, RADIO AND RADAR 
CONTACT WERE LOST AND THE AIRCRAFT CRASHED. BEFORE CRASHING THE AIRCRAFT WAS 
OBSERVED IN A ROLLING ATTITUDE. WRECKAGE WAS FOUND SCATTERED OVER A 
600' BY 150' AREA. AN EXAM REVEALED THE RIGHT WING HAD SEPD IN FLIGHT. THERE 
WAS EVIDENCE THAT THE RIGHT WING HAD FAILED IN AN UPWARD (POSITIVE) 
DRCTN. THE PILOT'S ATTITUDE GYRO WAS DAMAGED DURING IMPACT, BUT NO 
ROTATIONAL DAMAGE WAS NOTED. THE PILOT'S ATTITUDE INDCR AND COPILOT'S TURN 
INDCR WERE AIR DRIVEN, THE PILOT'S TURN INDCR WAS DC POWERED AND THE COPILOT'S 
ATTITUDE INDCR WAS AC POWERED. THE MAINTENANCE LOG DID NOT HAVE A 
CURRENT STATIC/ALTIMETER AND TRANSPONDER CHECK. 
MALFUNCTION OF ONE OR MORE FLIGHT INSTRUMENTS FOR AN UNDETERMINED 
REASON, FAILUE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT WITH 
PARTIAL PANEL INSTRUMENTS AFTER BECOMING SPATIALLY DISORIENTED, AND 
HIS EXCEEDING THE DESIGN STRESS LIMITS OF THE AIRCRAFT.  THE WEATHER 
(LOW CEILING) AND MALFUNCTIONING DIRECTIONAL GYRO WERE RELATED 
FACTORS.
