THE PILOT SAID THAT SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF, THE ENGINE FAILED. HE HAD 
ALREADY RETRACTED THE LANDING GEAR, AND ATTEMPTED A GEAR-UP LANDING 
ON THE REMAINING AVAILABLE RUNWAY. THE AIRCRAFT SLID ABOUT 300 FEET ON THE 
REMAINING RUNWAY, THEN AN ADDITIONAL 100 FEET ON THE MAINTAINED GRASS 
OVERRUN. POST ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION FAILED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF 
THE ENGINE FAILURE. 
LOSS OF ENGINE POWER FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS. PREMATURE RETRACTION 
OF THE LANDING GEAR BY THE PILOT WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR.
