THE PILOT REPORTED HE WAS LANDING ON A 1700' AIRSTRIP THAT HE HAD 
ROUTINELY USED. HE SAID HE LANDED SLIGHTLY SHORT AND BELOW THE RUNWAY 
GRADE, STRIKING THE RIGHT MAIN LANDING GEAR ON THE LIP OF THE RUNWAY.  
THE RIGHT MAIN GEAR FAILED AND SEPARATED FROM THE WING, DAMAGING THE 
WING SPAR.  THE PILOT SAID HE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY WITH THE APPROACH TO 
LANDING DUE TO SUNGLARE. ON A SUBSEQUENT APPLICATION FOR MED CERT, 
DATED 3/28/90, THE PILOT RPRTD 8000 HRS OF FLIGHT TIME. 
THE PILOT MISJUDGED HIS ALTITUDE AND DISTANCE FROM THE RUNWAY DRG THE 
APPROACH, WHICH RESULTED IN A PREMATURE TOUCHDOWN AND FAILURE OF 
THE RIGHT MAIN LANDING GEAR, WHEN IT HIT THE RUNWAY LIP.  THE SUNGLARE 
AND LACK OF VISUAL CUES (VISUAL PERCEPTION) WERE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS.
