THE AIR TAXI PILOT WAS ATTEMPTING TO TRANSPORT A HUNTING PARTY FROM A 
SMALL LAKE WHICH HE HAD NOT LANDED ON BEFORE. HE REPORTED THAT IT WAS 
HIS LAST FLIGHT OF A VERY BUSY FLYING DAY, AND THAT THE HUNTERS WERE 
ALREADY A DAY LATE IN BEING PICKED UP DUE TO THE WEATHER. HE SAID THAT 
WHILE HE WAS LANDING AND LOADING HIS PASSENGERS, THE WIND SHIFTED. HE 
WAS UNAWARE OF THE WIND SHIFT. THE WIND WAS BLOWING OVER A SMALL HILL 
BESIDE THE LAKE THAT CREATED A DOWNDRAFT. ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, WHEN 
THE AIRPLANE BECAME AIRBORNE, THE TAKEOFF WAS DELAYED DUE TO THE 
WINDSHIFT AND DOWNDRAFT, AND THE AIRPLANE WAS UNABLE TO GAIN 
SUFFICIENT ALTITUDE TO CLEAR THE FAR SHORE. 
IMPROPER PLANNING/DECISION BY THE PILOT.  CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE:  
THE SURROUNDING TERRAIN, UNFAVORABLE WIND, DOWNDRAFT, THE PILOT'S 
LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA, AND HIS SELF INDUCED 
PRESSURE.
