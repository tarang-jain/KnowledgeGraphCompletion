AFTER LANDING LONG, THE PILOT ELECTED TO GO-AROUND. HE RETRACTED THE 
FLAPS TO FULL UP AND THE AIRCRAFT STOPPED CLIMBING AND STARTED SETTLING WITH THE 
STALL WARNING HORN SOUNDING. THE PILOT OBSERVED WIRES IN HIS FLIGHT PATH AND 
ROTATED THE PLANE TO AN ATTITUDE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE WIRE TO STRIKE 
THE AIRCRAFT'S BELLY, RATHER THAN ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD. AFTER THE WIRE 
STRIKE, THE AIRCRAFT DESCENDED OUT OF CONTROL AND COLLIDED WITH THE TERRAIN. 
ACCORDING TO THE GO-AROUND PROCEDURE IN THE FLIGHT MANUAL, THE FLAPS 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN RETRACTED TO ONLY 20 DEG UNTIL THE AIRCRAFT HAD 
ACCELERATED TO 75 MPH, THEN FURTHER FLAP RETRACTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
PERFORMED SLOWLY. 
A DELAYED BY THE PILOT IN GOING AROUND AND HIS FAILURE TO OBTAIN 
ADEQUATE AIRSPEED BEFORE FULLY RETRACTING THE FLAPS, WHICH ALLOWED 
THE AIRCRAFT TO MUSH. THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE: THE PILOT'S 
FAILURE TO ATTAIN THE PROPER TOUCHDOWN POINT DURING THE LANDING AND 
THE TRANSMISSION WIRE.
