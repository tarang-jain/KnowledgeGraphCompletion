THE PILOT HAD BEEN MAKING AGRICULTURAL AERIAL APPLICATION FLIGHTS ALL 
DAY WITH SOME INTERRUPTIONS FOR RAIN.  HE HAD BEEN APPLYING LANNATE 
AND BRAVO; THE LOAD ABOARD AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WAS THE SAME.  
AFTER A LUNCH BREAK, THE PILOT MADE ONE FLIGHT AND LOADED FOR THE NEXT.  
THE LIFTOFF AND DEPARTURE WERE REPORTED TO BE NORMAL, BUT WHEN THE 
HELICOPTER DID NOT RETURN AS EXPECTED, A SEARCH WAS INITIATED.  
WRECKAGE OF THE HELICOPTER WAS FOUND NEAR THE INTENDED AERIAL 
APPLICATION SITE.  NO PREIMPACT MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION OR FAILURE WAS 
FOUND; HOWEVER, THE HELICOPTER WAS EXTENSIVELY DAMAGED.  A TOXICOLOGY 
CHECK OF THE PILOT'S BLOOD REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF METHOMYL (LANNATE) 
AT A LEVEL OF 600 PARTS/BILLION.  THE PILOT HAD NOT BEEN USING A 
RESPIRATOR.  HIS LAST RPRTD MEDICAL CHECK WAS ON 2/7/89. 
IMPROPER PLANNING/DECISION BY THE PILOT, WHICH RESULTED IN HIS PHYSICAL 
IMPAIRMENT FROM EXPOSURE TO LANNATE, AND HIS FAILURE TO MAINTAIN 
ALTITUDE/CLEARANCE ABOVE THE GROUND.  A FACTOR RELATED TO THE 
ACCIDENT WAS:  FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO USE A RESPIRATOR WHILE HANDLING 
OR BEING EXPOSED TO LANNATE.,
