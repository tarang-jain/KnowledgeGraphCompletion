DURING TAKEOFF, THE AIRCRAFT ROLLED ABRUPTLY TO THE RIGHT AFTER LIFT-OFF.  
SUBSEQUENTLY, THE RIGHT WINGTIP STRUCK THE SURFACE, THEN THE AIRCRAFT 
CARTWHEELED AND CRASHED. THE FUSELAGE WAS DESTROYED BY A POST-CRASH 
FIRE.  AN EXAM OF THE ENGS REVEALED THAT THE RIGHT ENG SUPERCHARGER 
INTERMEDIATE DRIVE GEAR SHAFT HAD BECOME WORN AND ONE OF ITS GEAR TEETH 
HAD FAILED FROM FATIGUE. THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT AN OUT-OF-MESH 
CONDITION OCCURRED, WHICH RESULTED IN A PARTIAL LOSS OF ENG POWER 
DURING TAKEOFF. ALSO, THE AIRCRAFT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 679 LBS OVER ITS MAX 
CERTIFIED GROSS WEIGHT. DENSITY ALT WAS CALCULATED TO BE ABOUT 2000 FT. 
THE FATIGUE FAILURE OF THE SUPERCHARGER INTERMEDIATE DRIVE GEAR SHAFT 
(GEAR TOOTH), WHICH RESULTED IN A PARTIAL LOSS OF POWER, AND THE PILOT'S 
INITIATION OF LIFT-OFF BEFORE REACHING VMC AIRSPEED.  FACTORS RELATED TO 
THE ACCIDENT WERE:  THE WORN INTERMEDIATE DRIVE GEAR SHAFT, THE PILOT'S 
OPERATION OF THE AIRCRAFT ABOVE ITS MAXIMUM CERTIFIED GROSS WEIGHT 
LIMIT, AND THE HIGH DENSITY ALTITUDE.
