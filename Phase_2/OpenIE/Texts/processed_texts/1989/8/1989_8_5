THE PILOT WAS CLEARED FOR A TOUCH-AND-GO LANDING ON RUNWAY 35. THE 
AIRCRAFT WAS OBSERVED TO TOUCH DOWN AT ABOUT MIDFIELD. THE PILOT SAID A 
GO-AROUND SEEMED ILL ADVISED, SO HE APPLIED BRAKES AND RAISED THE FLAPS. AS 
THE AIRCRAFT NEARED A FENCE, A RIGHT GROUND LOOP WAS MADE IN AN 
ATTEMPT TO AVOID A COLLISION. HOWEVER, THE LEFT WING MADE CONTACT WITH 
THE FENCE AND THE PROP CONTACTED THE GROUND. 
THE PILOT'S MISJUDGEMENT OF (EXCESSIVE) AIRSPEED, HIS FAILURE TO ATTAIN 
THE PROPER TOUCHDOWN POINT, AND FAILURE TO MAKE A GO-AROUND, WHILE 
THERE WAS SUFFICIENT RUNWAY REMAINING.  THE FENCE WAS A RELATED 
FACTOR.
