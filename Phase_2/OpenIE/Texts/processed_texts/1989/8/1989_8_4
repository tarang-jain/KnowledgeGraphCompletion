PILOT RETURNED DURING THE HOURS OF DARKNESS AND ATTEMPTED TO LAND ON 
A RUNWAY THAT DID NOT HAVE RUNWAY LIGHTS INSTALLED. HE LANDED IN A 
DITCH THAT PARALLELED THE RUNWAY, WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED THE 
AIRCRAFT. 
THE PILOT'S IMPROPER INFLIGHT DECISON TO LAND ON AN UNLIGHTED RUNWAY 
DURING THE HOURS OF DARKNESS. DARKNESS AND THE LACK OF RUNWAY LIGHTS 
WERE RELATED FACTORS.
