AFTER TAKEOFF, THE PILOT TURNED TO A NORTHERLY HEADING AND REMAINED AT 
LOW ALT TO VIEW HIS AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPEMENT NEAR THE AIRSTRIP. THIS 
HEADING TOOK THE AIRCRAFT TOWARD HIGH TENSION POWER LINES, JUST NORTH OF 
THE PRIVATE STRIP. THE PILOT SELECTED A FLIGHT PATH OVER THE LOWEST SAG IN THE 
LINES; HOWEVER, NEITHER HE NOR THE PASSENGER SAW THE STATIC CABLES 
ABOVE THE MAIN TRANSMISSION LINES. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED 
WITH AN UPPER (STATIC) CABLE. THE CABLE STOPPED THE AIRCRAFT'S FORWARD 
MOVEMENT AND IT DROPPED NEARLY STRAIGHT-DOWN TO THE GROUND. 
FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN PROPER ALTITUDE AND HIS FAILURE TO 
MAINTAIN ADEQUATE VISUAL LOOKOUT TO SEE AND AVOID OBSTRUCTIONS.  THE 
STATIC LINE (OBSTRUCTION) WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR.
