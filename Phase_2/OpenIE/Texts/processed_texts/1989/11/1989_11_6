THE PILOT RPRTD THAT AFTER COMPLETING A SWATH RUN, HE 'PULLED UP AND HELD 
BACK LONGER TO CLEAR TREES AT THE END OF THE FIELD.'  THE HELICOPTER LOST 
AIRSPEED FASTER THAN THE PILOT REALIZED. HE STATED THAT AT THE TOP OF THE 
TURN, THE HELICOPTER FELT LIKE IT WOULD SLIDE BACKWARDS, SO HE PUSHED 
THE CYCLIC FORWARD, APPLIED FULL POWER AND TRIED TO FLY OUT OF THE 
SITUATION. HOWEVER, THE HELICOPTER CONTD TO DESCEND. SUBSEQUENTLY, IT 
IMPACTED WITH TREES AND WAS DAMAGED. 
FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN ROTOR RPM AFTER PULLING UP FROM A 
SWATH RUN.  A RELATED FACTOR WAS THE PRESENCE OF TREES.
