WHILE ATTEMPTING A VISUAL APPROACH TO AN UNCONTROLLED AIRPORT, THE 
AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH TREES ABOUT TWO MILES NORTH EAST. THE PILOT 
REPORTED OVER THE AIRPORT, AND WOULD LOOK FOR A HOLE TO DESCEND 
THROUGH FOR A VISUAL LANDING. SECONDS LATER THE AIRPLANE CRASHED. THE 
INVESTIGATION FAILED TO DISCLOSE ANY MECHANICAL PROBLEMS. THE PILOT WAS 
NOT CERTIFICATED. HIS STUDENT PILOT'S CERTIFICATE HAD EXPIRED AND THERE 
WAS NO CURRENT SOLO ENDORSEMENT. THE UNICOM OPERATOR REPORTED LOW 
CEILING AND RAIN AT THE AIRPORT WHEN THE PILOT WAS ATTEMPTING THE 
LANDING APPROACH. 
THE PILOT'S CONTINUED VFR FLIGHT INTO IMC AND HIS ATTEMPT TO LAND THE 
AIRPLANE UNDER THE ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS.
