THE PILOT WAS MAKING HIS 1ST LANDING IN A HOME BUILT MIDGET MUSTANG, 
WHICH HE HAD RECENTLY PURCHASED.  DURING TOUCHDOWN, THE AIRCRAFT 
BOUNCED AND THE PILOT ELECTED TO GO AROUND.  WITNESSES RPRTD THAT THE AIRCRAFT 
ROLLED TO THE LEFT (TORQUE ROLLED) AS HE APPLIED FULL POWER, THEN 
CRASHED INVERTED BESIDE THE RUNWAY.  NO PREIMPACT MECHANICAL PROBLEM WAS 
FOUND. 
IMPROPER HANDLING OF THE AIRCRAFT BY THE PILOT, WHICH RESULTED IN HIS 
LOSS OF CONTROL.   HIS LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS TYPE OF AIRCRAFT WAS A 
RELATED FACTOR.
