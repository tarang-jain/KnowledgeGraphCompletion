THE CFI REPORTED THAT THE DUAL STUDENT PILOT INITIATED THE TAKEOFF ROLL 
WITH AILERON INTO THE WIND (LEFT AILERON), BUT THAT HE RELAXED AILERON 
PRESSURE PREMATURELY. WHEN INSTRUCTED TO INCREASE LEFT AILERON, THE 
STUDENT REACTED BY APPLYING LEFT RUDDER AND LEFT BRAKE. AT THAT TIME, THE 
AIRCRAFT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE TRAVELING ABOUT 45 TO 50 MPH. THE AIRCRAFT SWERVED 
TO THE LEFT AND THE CFI WAS UNABLE TO REGAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL. 
SUBSEQUENTLY, THE AIRCRAFT WENT OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY, ENCOUNTERED 
'SOFT GRASS' AND WAS DAMAGED. THE STUDENT HAD ONLY 4 HRS OF FLIGHT TIME. THE 
CFI HAD OBTAINED HIS CFI RATING ON 12/20/88 AND HAD ACCUMULATED 82 HRS OF 
INSTRUCTION SINCE THAT TIME. 
IMPROPER USE OF FLIGHT CONTROLS BY THE STUDENT PILOT, WHICH RESULTED IN 
HIS LOSS OF DIRECTIONAL CONTROL AND AN INADVERTENT GROUND SWERVE; AND 
THE INSTRUCTOR PILOT'S (CFI'S) INADEQUATE SUPERVISION.  FACTORS RELATED TO 
THE ACCIDENT WERE:  THE CROSSWIND CONDITION, THE STUDENT PILOT'S LACK OF 
TOTAL EXPERIENCE, THE CFI'S LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN THE TYPE OF OPERATION, 
AND SOFT TERRAIN.
