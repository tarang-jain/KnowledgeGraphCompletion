THE RGT WING OF BLANIK L-13, N82756, HIT THE LEFT WING OF ANOTHER GLIDER 
(LS-1), WHICH WAS PARKED NEAR THE RGT EDGE OF THE RUNWAY, AS THE BLANIK WAS 
STARTING TO BE LAUNCHED BEHIND A TOW PLANE. ACCORDING TO THE WING 
WALKER, HE HAD HOOKED THE TOW ROPE TO THE BLANIK AND WAS LIFTING THE 
(RGT) WING, WHEN HE REALIZED THE LS-1 WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE RUNWAY. HE SAID 
HE PUT THE WING DOWN AND SHOUTED FOR A RELEASE AS HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT, 
BUT THE BLANIK PILOT FANNED THE RUDDER TO SIGNAL THE TOW PILOT FOR THE 
LAUNCH TO BEGIN. ACCORDING TO THE BLANIK PILOT, THE WING WALKER HAD 
RAISED THE WING (A SIGNAL TO BGN THE LAUNCH), THEN TRIED TO STOP THE 
LAUNCH, BUT DID NOT USE THE PROPER 'CUT' SIGNAL. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE 
LAUNCH BEGAN AND THE BLANIK VEERED SLIGHTLY RGT AND HIT THE LS-1 BEFORE THE 
BLANIK PILOT RELEASED THE TOW ROPE. 
INADEQUATE CREW COORDINATION BETWEEN THE GROUND LINEMAN AND THE 
BLANIK PILOT,  AND FAILURE OF THE  BLANIK PILOT TO MAINTAIN CLEARANCE 
BETWEEN HIS AIRCRAFT AND THE PARKED GLIDER.  A FACTOR RELATED TO THE 
ACCIDENT WAS THE PROXIMITY OF THE PARKED GLIDER TO THE RUNWAY.
