DURING A BANNER TOW OPERATION, TWO BANNERS WERE SET ON THE GROUND 
FOR PICKUP. JUST PRIOR TO PICKUP BY ONE OF THE AIRPLANES, A GUST OF WIND 
BLEW ONE BANNER ON TOP OF THE OTHER . THE AIRPLANE PICKED UP BOTH 
BANNERS WITHOUT THE PILOT KNOWING. THE GROUND PERSONNEL NOTIFIED THE 
PILOT WHO STARTED A TURN BACK TO THE AIRPORT TO RELEASE THE BANNERS. 
HOWEVER, THE PILOT COULD NOT MAINTAIN ALTITUDE. THE PILOT RELEASED THE 
BANNERS AT LOW ALTITUDE AND SPEED AND WAS UNABLE TO CLIMB. THE PILOT 
OPTED TO LAND THE AIRPLANE IN AN OPEN FIELD. DURING THE LANDING ROLL, 
THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH A FENCE AND NOSED OVER. 
IMPROPER ASSISTANCE BY GROUND PERSONNEL WHO INADVERTENTLY 
OVERLOADED THE AIRPLANE AND THE PILOT'S DELAY IN JETTISONING THE LOAD.
