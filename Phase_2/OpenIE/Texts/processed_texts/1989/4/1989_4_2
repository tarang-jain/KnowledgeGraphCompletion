DURING HIS THIRD SUPERVISED SOLO FLIGHT, THE STUDENT PILOT WAS 
REMAINING IN CLOSED TRAFFIC FOR TAKEOFF AND LANDING PRACTICE. ON THE 
FOURTH LANDING, THE STUDENT REPORTED THAT HE WAS JUST ABOUT READY TO 
FLARE WHEN HE FELT THE AIRPLANE SINK. HE ADDED POWER AND THE AIRPLANE 
HIT THE RUNWAY AND BOUNCED. DURING THE SECOND TOUCHDOWN, THE NOSE 
GEAR COLLAPSED AND THE AIRPLANE SLID TO A STOP ON ITS MAIN GEAR AND NOSE 
SECTION. THE LOCAL WIND WAS NEARLY ALIGNEDWITH THE RUNWAY AT ABOUT 6 
KNOTS. WX DATA LISTED ABOVE WAS FROM AN OBSERVATION AT A WX REPORTING 
STATION 15 MILES FROM THE ACCIDENT SITE. 
THE STUDENT PILOT FAILED TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT WHEN HE 
MISJUDGED THE HEIGHT OF THE LANDING FLARE. THE RECOVERY FROM THE 
BOUNCED LANDING WAS INADEQUATE AND THE NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED UPON 
IMPACT WITH THE RUNWAY.
