THE PILOT EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF DIRECTIONAL CONTROL DURING AN 
ATTEMPTED TAKEOFF ON A ROADWAY WHICH RAN PARALLEL TO THE PILOT'S SOD 
STRIP. THE AIRCRAFT SWERVED TO THE LEFT AND DEPARTED THE ROADWAY, 
WHERE IT ENCOUNTERED SOFT, MARSHY SOD AND A SHALLOW DITCH. THE 
AIRCRAFT NOSED OVER AND CAME TO A REST. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE WAS 
ATTEMPTING THE TAKEOFF FROM THE ROADWAY INSTEAD OF THE SOD STRIP 
BECAME OF  THE SOFT, WET CONDITION OF THE STRIP. 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL DURING THE 
ATTEMPTED TAKEOFF ON UNSUITABLE TERRAIN. THE PILOT'S LACK OF RECENT 
FLIGHT EXPERIENCE WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR.
