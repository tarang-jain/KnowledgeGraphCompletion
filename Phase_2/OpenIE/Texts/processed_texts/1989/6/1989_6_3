DURING THE TAKEOFF ROLL ON AN INSTRUMENT INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT, WHILE 
AT A POINT APPROXIMATELY HALFWAY DOWN THE RUNWAY, THE PRIVATE PILOT 
JUDGED THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS NOT ACCELERATING SATISFACTORILY AND 
ELECTED TO ABORT THE TAKEOFF. THE PILOT APPLIED BRAKES BUT WAS UNABLE 
TO STOP THE AIRCRAFT BEFORE IT RAN OFF THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY 
AND COLLIDED WITH TREES. BOTH THE PRIVATE PILOT AND THE INSTRUMENT 
INSTRUCTOR REPORTED THAT IT HAD BEEN RAINING IN THE AREA PRIOR TO THE 
FLIGHT, AND THE RUNWAY WAS WET, WITH STANDING WATER IN SPOTS. THE PILOT 
STATED THAT THE WATER 'DAMPERED THE BRAKING ACTION CONSIDERABLY.' 
PILOT'S INADEQUATE AIRCRAFT CONTROL DURING THE ABORTED TAKEOFF 
ATTEMPT, AND THE AIRCRAFT'S RESULTANT COLLISION WITH TREES. THE WET 
RUNWAY WAS A FACTOR IN THE LACK OF NORMAL BRAKING ACTION.
