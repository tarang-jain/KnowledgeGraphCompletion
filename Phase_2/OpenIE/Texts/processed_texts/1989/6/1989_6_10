DURING THE LOCAL FLIGHT OF THE EXPERIMENTAL AIRPLANE, A CONNECTING ROD 
BROKE IN THE ENGINE. THE PILOT WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT BACK TO THE AIRPORT 
FOR A FORCED LANDING BUT WAS UNABLE TO LAND ON THE RUNWAY DUE TO 
ANOTHER AIRPLANE THAT TAXIED ONTO THE RUNWAY IN FRONT OF THE 
APPROACHING AIRPLANE. THE AIRPLANE MADE AN OFF-RUNWAY, HARD LANDING, 
AND BOTH LANDING GEARS COLLAPSED. THE PILOT DID NOT FILE AN ACC REPORT.
TOTAL FAILURE OF THE ENGINE CONNECTING ROD.
