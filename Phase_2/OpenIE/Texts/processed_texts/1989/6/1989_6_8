THE PILOT STATED THAT HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO DEPART FROM A 2,000 FOOT 
LONG SOD STRIP WITH A LOAD OF MALATHION FOR AGRICULTURAL APPLICATION. 
HE REPORTED THAT THE AIRCRAFT ENCOUNTERED A SOGGY PORTION OF THE 
AIRSTRIP AND FAILED TO ACCELERATE TO ROTATION SPEED. THE AIRCRAFT RAN 
OFF THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY, AND STRUCK A SMALL TREE BEFORE IT 
IMPACTED A DIRT BANK AND CAME TO A STOP. 
THE PILOT'S POOR PREFLIGHT ASSESSMENT OF THE RUNWAY 
CONDITION/AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES, AND THE AIRCRAFT'S 
RESULTANT FAILURE TO ATTAIN FLYING SPEED. SOFT TERRAIN IS A FACTOR IN THE 
ACCIDENT.
