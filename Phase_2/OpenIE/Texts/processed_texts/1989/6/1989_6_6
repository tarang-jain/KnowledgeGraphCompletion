THE AIRCRAFT MADE A HARD LANDING, RAN OFF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY 
AND COLLIDED WITH THE TERRAIN.  SUBSEQUENTLY, THE PLANE ERUPTED IN 
FLAMES AND WAS DESTROYED, BUT THE PILOT AND PASSENGERS WERE NOT 
INJURED. 
IMPROPER FLARE BY THE PILOT DURING THE LANDING, AND HIS FAILURE TO 
MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT.
