THE AIRCRAFT DEPARTED FOR THE X-COUNTRY FLIGHT IN IMC CONDITIONS. WHILE 
CLIMBING TO CRUISE, THE PILOT EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF AIRCRAFT CONTROL 
FOLLOWED BY AN INFLIGHT SEPARATION OF BOTH WINGS AND THE EMPENNAGE. 
SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED ICE BLOCKING THE PITOT/STATIC TUBE. 
ICING FORECASTS WERE VALID FOR THE PERIOD COVERING THE TIME OF THE 
FLIGHT AND THE PILOT HAD RECEIVED A BRIEFING REGARDING POSSIBLE ICE. 
ALTHOUGH THE PITOT HEAT TESTED TO BE OPERATIONAL WHEN CHECKED DURING 
A POST ACCIDENT EXAM, THE PITOT HEAT SWITCH WAS FOUND IN THE OFF 
POSITION AFTER THE ACCIDENT. 
THE PILOT'S POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE WEATHER FORECAST, HIS FAILURE TO 
UTILIZE THE PITOT HEAT IN ICING CONDITIONS AND THE EXCEEDING OF THE 
STRESS LIMITS OF THE AIRCRAFT.
