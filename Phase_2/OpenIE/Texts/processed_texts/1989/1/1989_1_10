THE COMMERCIAL AIR TAXI PILOT AND HIS PASSENGER WERE UNINJURED 
FOLLOWING A FORCED LANDING. THE PILOT SAID THAT HE HAD FLOWN OVER HIS 
INTENDED LANDING SITE AT RUSSIAN MISSION, AK., TO INSPECT THE RUNWAY. ON 
THE DOWNWIND LEG, THE ENGINE OF CESSNA 207 LOST MOST OF ITS POWER. HE 
WAS UNABLE TO RESTORE SUFFICIENT POWER TO REMAIN AIRBORNE AND ELECTED 
TO LAND ON THE NEARBY, FROZEN, YUKON RIVER. HE SAID THAT HE MISJUDGED 
HIS ALTITUDE DURING THE LANDING APPROACH DUE TO THE FEATURELESS, ALL 
WHITE SURFACE OF THE RIVER, AND STRUCK THE SURFACE WHILE STILL IN A 
SLIGHT RIGHT TURN. INSPECTION OF THE CRASH SITE TWO DAYS AFTER THE 
ACCIDENT REVEALED NUMEROUS ICE CRYSTALS IN THE LEFT FUEL TANK SUMP. NO 
OTHER OBVIOUS ABNORMALITIES WERE NOTED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF THE ICE 
CRYSTALS FOUND IN THE FUEL TANK WERE CONTRIBUTORY TO THE ACCIDENT DUE 
TO THE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE SAMPLE AND THE ACCIDENT. 
THE PARTIAL ENGINE POWER LOSS DUE TO UNDETERMINED REASONS. 
CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT'S IMPROPER INFLIGHT 
PLANNING BY FLYING AT A TRAFFIC PATTERN ALTITUDE INSUFFICIENT TO INSURE A 
SAFE EMERGENCY LANDING EITHER ON OR OFF THE AIRPORT AND HIS 
MISJUDGEMENT OF CLEARANCE ABOVE THE FROZEN RIVER.
