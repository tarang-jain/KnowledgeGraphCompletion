THE PILOT WAS RETURNING FROM A CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHT WHEN THE ENGINE 
STOPPED PRODUCING POWER. DURING THE FORCED LANDING, THE AIRPLANE 
STRUCK WIRES, THEN THE TERRAIN. THE FUEL SYSTEM WAS CHECKED, AND NO 
BREAKS WERE FOUND. THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO FUEL LEFT IN THE TANKS. THE 
ENGINES RAN NORMALLY ON ANOTHER AIRPLANE. 
THE PILOT DID NOT HAVE AN ADEQUATE FUEL SUPPLY TO COMPLETE THE FLIGHT. 
THE PILOTS FLIGHT PLANNING WAS INADEQUATE AND THE IGNORED OPPORTUNITIES TO 
OBTAIN FUEL ENROUTE LED TO FUEL EXHAUSTION, PRIOR TO REACHING 
DESTINATION.
