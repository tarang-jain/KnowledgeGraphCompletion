 THE LIGHT SINGLE-ENGINED AIRPLANE HAD DESCENDED TO A NEW ALTITUDE.  
THE PILOT ADVANCED THE THROTTLE WITH THE INTENT OF OBTAINING CRUISE 
POWER. THE ENGINE DID NOT RESPOND TO THE POWER APPLICATION.  IT 
REMAINED AT THE PREVIOUSLY SET IDLE RPM AND BEGAN GRADUALLY LOOSING 
THE RPM.  THE PILOT CHOSE A FLAT AREA ADJACENT TO A POND FOR THE FORCED 
LANDING.  THE PILOT STATED HE DID NOT TOUCH DOWN ON THE FLAT AREA 
BECAUSE THE AIRPLANE'S AIRSPEED WAS TOO FAST.  THE AIRPLANE TOUCHED 
DOWN ON THE RIDGE THAT WAS AT THE END OF THE FLAT AREA AND WAS 
SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED.  AN ON SCENE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE 
THROTTLE ROD END BEARING WAS NOT ATTACHED TO THE THROTTLE RACKET.  
THE ATTACHING BOLT WAS MISSING.  BOTH COMPONENTS WERE COMPLETELY 
SEPARATEED RATHER THAN ATTACHED. 
 THE RESULT OF AN INADEQUATE ANNUAL INSPECTION BY OTHER MAINTENANCE 
PERSONNEL AND, AS A RESULT, A TOTAL FAILURE OF THE THROTTLE LINKAGE. A 
FACTOR WAS THE PILOT OVERSHOT HIS INTENDED EMERGENCY LANDING AREA, 
DUE TO EXCESSIVE SPEED.
