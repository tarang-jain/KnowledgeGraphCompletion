 THE PILOT WAS ATTEMPTING A HIGH SPEED TAXI TEST WHEN THE AIRPLANE 
BECAME AIRBORNE. A NORMAL CLIMB WAS MADE TO APPROXIMATELY 1,000 FEET 
AGL. THE PILOT MADE SEVERAL LEFT TURNS WHILE IN LEVEL FLIGHT AND 
PROCEEDED BACK TOWARD THE AIRPORT. DURING THE APPROACH, THE 
PROPELLER SYSTEM'S VARIABLE CONTROL MECHANISM SLIPPED WHICH ALLOWED 
THE PROPELLER TO GO TO THE FULL FEATHER POSITION. THE AIRPLANE'S 
AIRSPEED WAS BETWEEN 160 TO 180 MPH WHEN THIS OCCURRED, ACCORDING TO 
THE PILOT. THE AIRSPEED THEN DROPPED TO APPROXIMATELY 100 MPH AND THE 
PILOT INITIATED A FORCED LANDING TO AN OPEN FIELD. DURING THE FLARE PRIOR 
TO TOUCHDOWN, THE PILOT ADDED POWER AND THE AIRPLANE YAWED. THE LEFT 
WING TIP STRUCK THE GROUND AND THE PILOT LOST CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE 
WHICH THEN IMPACTED THE TERRAIN. THE PILOT STATED THE PROPELLER 
CONTROL SYSTEM PROBABLY VIBRATED LOOSE DURING THE FLIGHT. THIS SYSTEM 
IS CONTROLLED BY THE PILOT FROM THE COCKPIT WITH A VERNIER KNOB. THE 
PILOT BUILT THE AIRPLANE AND HAD NOT FLOWN IT BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. 
 THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AIRCRAFT CONTROL DURING THE FLARE. 
FACTORS WERE THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE PROPELLER FEATHERING SYSTEM AND 
THE PILOT'S TOTAL LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN TYPE AIRCRAFT AND THE SLIPPED 
PROPELLER PITCH CHANGE SYSTEM.
