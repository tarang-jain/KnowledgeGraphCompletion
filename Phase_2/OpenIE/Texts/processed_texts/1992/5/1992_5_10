 A STUDENT PILOT WAS IN THE LEFT SEAT OF HIS NEWLY PURCHASED AIRCRAFT 
AND A PRIVATE PILOT OCCUPIED THE RIGHT SEAT. THE INVESTIGATION WAS 
UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHO WAS FLYING THE AIRCRAFT AT THE TIME OF THE 
ACCIDENT. THE PILOTS INITIATED A GO AROUND AFTER A HARD LANDING WHICH 
SHEARED OFF THE LEFT MAIN LANDING GEAR, BROKE THE NOSE GEAR STRUT, AND 
DAMAGED THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER. WITNESSES STATED THAT THE CLIMB 
RATE AND THE AIRSPEED APPEARED TO BE VERY LOW, AND THAT THE LEFT 
HORIZONTAL STABILIZER APPEARED TO BE BENT DOWN. ACCORDING TO 
WITNESSES, DURING THE CROSS WIND AND DOWN WIND LEGS, THE AIRPLANE WAS 
MAKING ABRUPT PITCH CHANGES AND NEVER ATTAINED ALTITUDES OF MORE 
THAN 300 TO 500 FEET AGL.  WHILE ON A CLOSE IN DOWN WIND LEG, THE AIRPLANE 
STRUCK AN INDUSTRIAL BUILDING WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET HIGHER 
THAN THE RUNWAY SURFACE. THE STUDENT PILOT HAD JUST TRADED ANOTHER 
AIRPLANE FOR THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE WHICH HAD JUST HAD AN ANNUAL 
INSPECTION AND WAS SIGNED OFF AS UNAIRWORTHY. 
 1) THE FLYING PILOT'S IMPROPER LANDING FLARE WHICH RESULTED IN A HARD 
LANDING AND SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT EMPENNAGE FLIGHT 
CONTROLS, 2) THE FLYING PILOT'S DECISION TO INITIATE A GO AROUND WITH THE 
OBVIOUS SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT, AND 3) THE FLYING PILOT'S 
INABILITY TO CONTROL THE AIRCRAFT IN PITCH DUE TO THE DAMAGE SUSTAINED 
IN THE HARD LANDING.  A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOTS LACK OF 
EXPERIENCE IN THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE.
