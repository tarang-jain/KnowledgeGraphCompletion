 THE STUDENT PILOT WAS LANDING AT THE FIRST STOP OF A LONG CROSS-
COUNTRY. DURING THE LANDING APPROACH HER ATTENTION WAS DIVERTED BY 
ANOTHER AIRPLANE IN THE LANDING PATTERN. SHE STATED THAT SHE 
SHORTENED THE LANDING PATTERN, WAS A LITTLE FAST ON THE APPROACH, AND 
USED 10 DEGREES VICE 20 DEGREES OF FLAPS. WHEN THE RUNWAY WAS MADE, SHE 
RETARDED THE THROTTLE, AND AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO FLARE FOR LANDING, THE 
AIRPLANE LANDED HARD. THE NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED. 
 THE IMPROPER LEVEL OFF BY THE STUDENT PILOT BECAUSE OF MISJUDGING THE 
AIRPLANE'S ALTITUDE ABOVE THE RUNWAY. A FACTOR WAS HER DIVERTED 
ATTENTION BY AN AIRCRAFT BEHIND HER IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN.
