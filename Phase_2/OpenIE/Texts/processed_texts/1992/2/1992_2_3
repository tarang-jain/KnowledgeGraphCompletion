 THE PILOT STARTED THE ENG AND LEFT THE AUX FUEL BOOST PUMP ON. WHILE 
TAXIING TO TAKE OFF, THE ENG QUIT.  THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO START THE ENG BUT 
OBSERVED FLAMES FROM THE FRONT OF THE ENG COWLING.  THE PILOT AND PAX 
EXITED THE AIRCRAFT BUT THE PILOT LEFT THE MASTER AND AUXILIARY FUEL BOOST PUMP 
SWITCHES ON, WHICH CONTINUED TO FEED FUEL TO THE FIRE.  THE FIRE WAS 
EXTINGUISHED AFTER THE MASTER SWITCH WAS TURNED OFF AND CHEMICAL 
APPLIED TO THE FIRE. ACCORDING TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHO EXAMINED THE AIRCRAFT, 
IN HIS OPINION, THE PILOT FLOODED THE ENG WHILE ATTEMPTING TO RESTART IT, AND 
DUE TO THE EXCESS FUEL, THE ENG BACKFIRED AND THE EXCESS FUEL CAUGHT FIRE. 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
 IMPROPER PROCEDURES/DIRECTIVES BY THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND WHILE 
ATTEMPTING TO RESTART THE ENGINE, RESULTING IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT 
FIRE.
