 THE PILOT WAS SIMULATING A FORCED LANDING TO AN ABANDONED GRASS STRIP. 
WHEN HE APPLIED POWER TO TERMINATE THE MANEUVER, HE 'PUSHED THE 
THROTTLE TO FULL POWER' BUT THE ENGINE FAILED TO RESPOND DUE TO 
CARBURETOR ICING. THE PILOT LANDED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE STRIP FOR 
WHICH HE WAS LINED UP FOR HIS SIMULATED FORCED LANDING. THE EXISTING 
WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WERE HIGHLY CONDUCIVE 
TO THE FORMATION OF CARBURETOR ICING. 
THE PILOT'S IMPROPER USE OF CARBURETOR HEAT RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF 
ENGINE POWER DUE TO CARBURETOR ICE. THE CARBURETOR ICING CONDITIONS 
AND THE SOFT TERRAIN IN THE LANDING AREA WERE FACTORS.
