 WHILE DESCENDING TO LAND, THE ENG QUIT.  ATTEMPTS TO RESTART WERE 
UNSUCCESSFUL.  THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH TREES DURING THE LANDING ROLL 
FOLLOWING THE FORCED LANDING.  THE AIRCRAFT WAS RECOVERED AND TAKEN TO A 
FACILITY WHERE THE ENG WAS REMOVED FOR EXAMINATION.  EXAMINATION OF 
THE ENGINE REVEALED THAT THE CRANKSHAFT FAILED NEAR THE REAR MAIN 
BEARING. ALSO, EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE REAR MAIN BEARING SPUN IN ITS 
SUPPORT AND WAS PARTIALLY EXTRUDED INTO THE ACCESSORY SECTION.  
EXAMINATION OF THE CRANKCASE HALVES ADJACENT TO THE REAR MAIN BEARING 
INDICATED FRETTING. THE ENG HAD ACCUMULATED 174 HRS SINCE NEW.  
METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE CRANKSHAFT REVEALED THAT IT FAILED 
DUE TO HIGH CYCLE FATIGUE. 
 FATIGUE FAILURE OF THE CRANKSHAFT DUE TO IMPROPER ENGINE ASSEMBLY BY 
THE MANUFACTURER.
