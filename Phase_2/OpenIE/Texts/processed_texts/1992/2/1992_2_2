 THIS WAS THE FIRST FLIGHT FOR THE AMATEUR HOMEBUILT AIRPLANE.  THE 
PILOT WAS SEEN TO USE ABOUT 6975 FEET OF THE 10,001 FOOT RUNWAY BEFORE 
LIFTING OFF. THE PILOT SAID HE ROTATED AND CLIMBED OUT AT 67 MPH. THE 
AIRPLANE DRIFTED TO THE RIGHT AND THE RIGHT WING DROPPED.  THE PILOT 
ATTEMPTED TO 'MUSH' THE AIRPLANE ONTO THE GROUND.  TOWER CONTROLLERS 
SAID THE AIRPLANE LIFTED OFF IN AN EXTREME NOSE HIGH ATTITUDE AND 
APPEARED TO STALL.  PILOTS FAMILIAR WITH THE AIRPLANE SAID THE AIRPLANE 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN ROTATED BETWEEN 80-85 MPH IAS. 
 IMPROPER VR SPEED USED, CAUSING AN INADVERTENT STALL/MUSH.  A FACTOR 
WAS: THE PILOT'S LACK OF TOTAL EXPERIENCE IN AIRCRAFT MAKE AND MODEL.
