 DURING AN IFR FLIGHT THE PILOT NOTICED A GRADUAL LOSS OF ELECTRICAL 
POWER DUE TO A FAULTY VOLTAGE REGULATOR. THE PILOT REQUESTED A CHANGE 
IN ROUTING FROM ARTCC WITH THE INTENTION OF LANDING. ACCORDING TO THE 
PILOT, HE CIRCLED OVER THE AIRPORT UNTIL RECEIVING A GREEN LIGHT FROM 
THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER. WHILE ON FINAL APPROACH FOR LANDING THE PILOT RECEIVED A 
RED LIGHT FROM THE TOWER. THE PILOT INITIATED A GO-AROUND MANEUVER 
AND BEGAN HIS SECOND APPROACH SHORTLY THEREAFTER. THE AIRPLANE MADE A 
GEAR-UP LANDING DURING THE SECOND LANDING APPROACH. WHEN ASKED IF HE 
UTILIZED THE EMERGENCY GEAR EXTENSION SYSTEM THE PILOT STATED HE DID 
NOT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE FELT THE LANDING GEAR DRAG. 
 A RESULT OF THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND NOT UNDERSTANDING THE AIRPLANES 
EMERGENCY PROCEDURES AND NOT PERFORMING THE APPROPRIATE EMERGENCY 
PROCEDURES. A FACTOR ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCIDENT WAS AN ELECTRICAL 
SYSTEM FAILURE.
