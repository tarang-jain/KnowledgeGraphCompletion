 APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES AFTER TAKEOFF, WHILE IN CRUISE FLIGHT, SMOKE 
APPEARED FROM THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE INSTRUMENT PANEL.  THE PILOT 
INITIATED A FORCED LANDING IN AN OPEN FARM FIELD.  PRIOR TO TOUCHDOWN 
FLAMES WERE PRESENT IN THE COCKPIT.  AFTER THE LANDING, THE PILOT EXITED 
THE AIRPLANE, WITH MINOR INJURIES.  THE AIRPLANE CONTINUED TO BURN.  A 
SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION FAILED TO REVEAL THE SOURCE WHERE THE FIRE 
ORIGINATED.  THE PILOT DESCRIBED THE ORIGIN TO BE AN ELECTRICAL FIRE; 
HOWEVER, DURING THE EMERGENCY PROCEDURES HE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO 
DISENGAGE THE MASTER SWITCH. 
 THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S FAILURE TO FOLLOW EMERGENCY PROCEDURES, AND 
THE FIRE IN THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM FOR REASONS UNDETERMINED.
