 THE AIRSHIP WAS BEING FLOWN ON A POST MAINTENANCE INSPECTION FLIGHT 
FOLLOWING AN ANNUAL INSPECTION. AFTER RELEASE FROM THE MOORING TRUCK 
THE AIRSHIP ROSE ABOUT 150 FEET THEN PITCHED OVER. FULL AFT MOVEMENT OF 
THE CONTROL YOKE FOR NOSE PITCH UP WAS INEFFECTIVE. THE AIRSHIP THEN 
COLLIDED WITH THE VEHICLE MOUNTED MOORING MAST WHICH PUNCTURED THE 
AIR BAG. EXAMINATION OF THE AIRSHIP REVEALED THAT THE ELEVATOR CONTROL 
CABLES WERE RIGGED BACKWARDS. DURING THE ANNUAL INSPECTION THE 
ELEVATOR HAD BEEN REMOVED AND RE-INSTALLED. THE INSPECTOR WHO SIGNED 
OFF THE INSPECTION PAPERS DEMONSTRATED, AND STATED, THAT HIS INSPECTION 
PROCEDURE WAS ACCOMPLISHED ALONE. HE PUSHED ON THE ELEVATOR WITH HIS 
HAND TO CHECK ELEVATOR DEFLECTION. HE DID NOT HAVE A SECOND PERSON 
ACTIVATE THE COCKPIT CONTROL, TO ENSURE ELEVATOR MOVEMENT IN THE 
PROPER DIRECTION, AS REQUIRED BY THE MAINTENANCE MANUAL. THE FLIGHT 
CREW PRE-UNMASTING PROCEDURE REQUIRED THAT A GROUND CREW MAN BE 
USED TO CONFIRM CORRECT CONTROL SURFACE MOVEMENT. 
 THE IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF THE ELEVATOR CONTROL CABLES BY REPAIR 
FACILITY MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL, THE INSPECTOR'S INADEQUATE INSPECTION 
OF THE MAINTENANCE ACCOMPLISHED, AND HIS FAILURE TO FOLLOW DELINEATED 
PROCEDURES. AN ADDITIONAL CAUSE WAS THE INADEQUATE PREFLIGHT 
INSPECTION BY THE PILOT IN COMMAND, IN THAT HE FAILED TO CONFIRM 
CORRECT CONTROL SURFACE MOVEMENT AS REQUIRED BY THE PRE-UNMASTING 
CHECKLIST.
