THE AIRPLANE IMPACTED RISING TERRAIN 31 MI SOUTH OF THE DESTINATION. A 
WITNESS IN THE VICINITY OF THE ACCIDENT SITE REPORTED SEEING THE 
AIRPLANE FLYING AT BETWEEN 100-300 FEET AGL JUST BELOW THE CLOUDS WITH AN 
ESTIMATED GROUND VISIBILITY AT ABOUT 1 MI. THE PILOT HAD RECEIVED TWO 
WEATHER BRIEFINGS AND WAS AWARE OF LOW CEILINGS. HIS REPLY TO A 500-FT 
OVERCAST WAS '...FIVE HUNDRED UP THERE DOESN'T BOTHER ME BECAUSE AH, I'M, 
I'M REAL FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA.' 
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S INTENTIONAL FLIGHT INTO AN AREA OF LOW CEILINGS, 
AND HIS FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AN ALTITUDE SUFFICIENT FOR TERRAIN 
CLEARANCE. FACTORS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: THE PILOT'S 
OVERCONFIDENCE, THE LOW CEILING AND THE DARK NIGHT CONDITION.
