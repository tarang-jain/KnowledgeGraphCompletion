POWER OFF SPOT LANDING CONTEST.  AFTER COMPLETING THE FLOUR BOMBING 
EVENT THE PILOT ENTERED A LEFT DOWNWIND TO LAND ON A NORTH RUNWAY.  
THE SURFACE WINDS WERE FROM THE WEST AT 10 MPH, GUSTING TO 20 MPH WITH 
ASSOCIATED DOWNDRAFTS OFF OF THE RIDGE WEST OF THE AIRPORT. THE 
AIRPLANE OVERSHOT THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE WHILE AT A LOW ALTITUDE 
AND SLOW AIRSPEED.  THE PILOT APPLIED POWER, BUT CONTINUED TO INCREASE 
THE BANK.  THE WING STALLED AND THE AIRPLANE CRASHED. 
 THE PILOT'S POORLY PLANNED APPROACH, INADEQUATE COMPENSATION FOR THE 
EXISTING WINDS, AND FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AIRSPEED. CONTRIBUTING TO THIS 
ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT'S LACK OF TOTAL EXPEREINCE AND INADVERTENT STALL.
