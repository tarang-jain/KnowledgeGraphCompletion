 THE PILOT WAS LANDING ON THE GRASS AIRFIELD.  HE SAID THERE WERE 'HIGH 
POWER LINES' ON THE APPROACH TO THE RUNWAY.  HE SAID THAT HE OVERSHOT 
THE RUNWAY AND DECIDED TO GO-AROUND, BUT THE AIRPLANE TOUCHED DOWN 
ON THE RUNWAY.  HE SAID THERE WAS 'NOT ENOUGH SPEED' TO GET AIRBORNE, 
AND THE AIRPLANE STRUCK A DITCH AT THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY.  
THE PILOT HAD 1.7 HOURS TOTAL FLIGHT TIME IN THE LAST 90 DAYS. 
 THE PILOT'S IMPROPERLY PLANNED APPROACH AND DELAYED DECISION TO 
INITIATE A GO-AROUND, WHICH RESULTED IN A TOUCHDOWN TOO FAR DOWN THE 
RUNWAY AND THE SUBSEQUENT COLLISION WITH A DITCH.  A FACTOR RELATED TO 
THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT'S LACK OF RECENT FLIGHT EXPERIENCE.
