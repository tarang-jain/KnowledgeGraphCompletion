 THE STUDENT PILOT WAS PERFORMING TOUCH AND GO LANDINGS AT THE 
UNCONTROLLED AIRPORT WHEN THE AIRPLANE STARTED TO PORPOISE AFTER 
TOUCHDOWN AND AIRCRAFT CONTROL WAS LOST. HE ATTEMPTED TO ABORT THE 
LANDING AND RECOVER FROM THE BOUNCING BY ADDING FULL POWER. THE 
AIRPLANE WAS SEEN BY EYEWITNESSES TO LEAVE THE RUNWAY SURFACE AND 
DRIFT LEFT IN A NOSE HIGH, RIGHT BANK ATTITUDE FOR APPROXIMATELY 200 
YARDS AND THEN THE LEFT HORIZONTAL STABILIZER STRUCK A BUTANE TANK AND 
THE AIRPLANE CARTWHEELED TO IMPACT THE TERRAIN. THE FAA INSPECTOR DID 
NOT REPORT FINDING ANY MECHANICAL PROBLEMS WITH THE AIRPLANE. 
 THE STUDENT PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL OF THE 
AIRPLANE. A FACTOR WAS THE STALL/MUSH.
