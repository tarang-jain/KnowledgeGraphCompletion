 THE PILOT WAS IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN WHEN HE REALIZED HE WOULD NOT 
MAKE THE RUNWAY.  THE PILOT PLANNED HIS LANDING INTO AN OPEN FIELD 
WHILE ON BASE LEG.  DURING TOUCHDOWN, HE ENCOUNTERED RISING TERRAIN 
THAT WAS MASKED BY THE GRASS IN THE FIELD.  THE WINGS OF THE GLIDER WERE 
BENT DOWNWARD DURING THE LANDING. 
THE PILOT'S POORLY PLANNED APPROACH FOR LANDING WHICH RESULTED IN AN 
OFF AIRPORT LANDING IN UNSUITABLE TERRAIN.
