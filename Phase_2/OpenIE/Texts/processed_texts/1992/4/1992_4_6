 THE STUDENT PILOT DID NOT COMPENSATE PROPERLY FOR ADVERSE WINDS IN 
THE LANDING PATTERN.  WHEN TURNING FINAL APPROACH, HE OVERSHOT THE 
RUNWAY AND HAD DIFFICULTY ALIGNING WITH THE RUNWAY.  DURING THE FLARE, 
THE AIRPLANE BALLOONED, THE AIRSPEED DROPPED TO 45 KNOTS, THE AIRPLANE 
STALLED AND STRUCK THE RUNWAY. 
 THE FAILURE OF THE STUDENT PILOT TO COMPENSATE FOR ADVERSE WINDS 
DURING LANDING, WHICH RESULTED IN A LOSS OF AIRSPEED AND SUBSEQUENT 
STALL AND LOSS OF CONTROL.  A FACTOR RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE 
STUDENT PILOT'S LACK OF TOTAL FLIGHT EXPERIENCE.
