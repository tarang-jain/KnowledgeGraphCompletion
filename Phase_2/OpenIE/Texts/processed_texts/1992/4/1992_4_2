 THE STUDENT PILOT HAD BEEN PLANNING TO TAKE HIS LONG SOLO CROSS 
COUNTRY FLIGHT FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS.  ON THE ACCIDENT DATE THE STUDENT 
OBTAINED A COMPUTER WEATHER BRIEFING.  THE WEATHER FOR THE ROUTE OF 
FLIGHT WAS FORECASTED TO HAVE A CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS.  WEATHER AT 
THE DEPARTURE AIRPORT WAS LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS DURING THE TIME OF THE 
BRIEFING AND PREDEPARTURE DISCUSSION THE STUDENT HAD WITH HIS 
INSTRUCTOR.  THE STUDENT DEPARTED ON THE SOLO CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT 
DURING VERY LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS. APPROXIMATELY 8 TO 10 MINUTES AFTER 
THE STUDENT DEPARTED ON HIS FLIGHT, THE INSTRUCTOR CALLED HIM ON THE 
RADIO.  THE INSTRUCTOR ASKED THE STUDENT HOW THE WEATHER WAS.  THE 
STUDENT REPLIED THE VISIBILITY WAS THREE MILES. SHORTLY AFTER THIS 
CONVERSATION THE STUDENT CALLED THE AIRPORT AND STATED HE WAS LOST 
AND HAVING DIFFICULTY. THE AIRPORT MANAGER, A NON-PILOT, TOLD THE 
STUDENT TO MAKE A 180 DEGREE TURN AND RETURN TO THE AIRPORT.  A GROUND 
WITNESS STATED HE HEARD AN AIRPLANE FLY OVER HEAD TWO TIMES DURING 
VERY HEAVY SNOW SHOWERS.  DURING THE SECOND PASS THE WITNESS STATED HE 
HEARD A VACILLATING ENGINE SOUND AND A LOUD CRASH SOUND.  THE 
WRECKAGE WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES AFTER THE WITNESS 
HEARD THE ENGINE SOUNDS. 
 SPATIAL DISORIENTATION AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF 
THE AIRPLANE.  FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACCIDENT WERE THE SNOW 
CONDITIONS, AN INADEQUATE WEATHER EVALUATION BY BOTH THE STUDENT AND 
INSTRUCTOR, OVER CONFIDENCE IN PERSONAL ABILITY, INADEQUATE REMEDIAL 
ACTION, VFR FLIGHT INTO IMC CONDITIONS, AND LACK OF TOTAL EXPERIENCE ON 
BEHALF OF THE PILOT.
