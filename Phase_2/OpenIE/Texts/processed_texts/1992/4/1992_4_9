THE PILOT HAD FLOWN FIVE HOURS OF CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT OVER UNFAMILIAR 
TERRAIN IN A NON-HEATED COCKPIT. FOLLOWING THE LAST DEPARTURE THE 
PILOT ALTERNATED THE FUEL SELECTOR BETWEEN THE TANKS. AT THE TIME OF 
ENGINE POWER LOSS THE SELECTOR WAS ON THE RIGHT TANK AND THE PILOT DID 
NOT SELECT THE LEFT FUEL TANK DURING THE EMERGENCY PROCEDURE. DURING 
THE FORCED LANDING THE AIRPLANE IMPACTED TREES AND SUBSEQUENTLY 
DESCENDED UNCONTROLLED TO THE GROUND. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE 
RIGHT TANK RAN DRY. 
 LOSS OF ENGINE DUE TO FUEL STARVATION AND UNSUITABLE TERRAIN. FACTORS 
WERE THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO FOLLOW PUBLISHED PROCEDURES.
