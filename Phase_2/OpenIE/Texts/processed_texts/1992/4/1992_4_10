 THE 60 HOUR STUDENT PILOT HAD A TOTAL OF 25 HOURS IN TYPE, ALL OF WHICH 
WERE DUAL. WITH HIS CURRENT FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR THE STUDENT RETURNED TO 
THEIR HOME BASE AIRPORT TO PERFORM A PREARRANGED GO-AROUND TO 
FINALIZE THEIR DUAL PERIOD FOR THE EVENING. AFTER THE APPROACH TO THE 
RUNWAY, THE INSTRUCTOR CALLED FOR THE GO-AROUND. AFTER THE CLIMB WAS 
ESTABLISHED AT ABOUT 500 FEET AGL HE CALLED FOR THE COWL FLAPS TO BE 
OPENED, AND MOMENTS LATER THE ENGINE SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT WARNING 
QUIT. THE INSTRUCTOR SAID THAT AFTER THE ENGINE QUIT THE STUDENT PULLED 
THE CONTROL YOKE ALL THE WAY BACK AND THE AIRCRAFT ENTERED A DEEP 
STALL. THE AIRPLANE HAD BEEN MODIFIED TO ACCOMMODATE AN ENGINE WITH 
MORE HORSE POWER WHICH REQUIRED THE INSTALLATION OF COWL FLAPS. THE 
FAA APPROVED STC MODIFICATION DRAWINGS REQUIRED THE PUSH-PULL 
CONTROL FOR THE COWL FLAPS TO BE LOCATED TO THE LEFT OF THE THROTTLE 
CONSOLE ON A SEPARATE SWITCH PANEL. THE ACTUAL LOCATION OF THAT 
CONTROL IN THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE WAS FOUND TO THE RIGHT OF THE 
THROTTLE BELOW THE PROPELLER CONTROL AND NEXT TO 
 THE STUDENT PILOT'S INADVERTENT USE OF THE MIXTURE CONTROL INSTEAD OF 
THE COWL FLAPS AT A CRITICAL PHASE OF FLIGHT, HIS MISUSE OF THE FLIGHT 
CONTROLS AFTER THE ENGINE FAILURE AND THE INSTRUCTOR'S INADEQUATE 
SUPERVISION OF THE STUDENT. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS IN THE ACCIDENT WERE: 
THE NON STANDARD LOCATION OF THE COWL FLAP PUSH PULL CONTROL, DUE TO 
AN IMPROPER AIRCRAFT MODIFICATION, THE DARK NIGHT LIGHT CONDITIONS 
WHICH IMPAIRED THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS ABILITY TO MONITOR THE STUDENT 
COCKPIT CONTROL MANIPULATIONS.
