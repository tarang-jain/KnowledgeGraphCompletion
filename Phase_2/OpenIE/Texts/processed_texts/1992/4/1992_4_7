 ONE OF 3 AVID AIRCRAFT MARK IV'S IN A CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT ENCOUNTERED A 
TOTAL POWER LOSS WHILE CRUISING AT 8500 FEET MSL.  THE PILOT WAS UNABLE 
TO RESTART THE ENGINE AND EXECUTED A FORCED LANDING ON SNOW COVERED 
TERRAIN DURING WHICH THE AIRCRAFT NOSED OVER.  THE AIRCRAFT HAD 
SUSTAINED A SIMILAR POWER LOSS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY'S FLIGHT AND THE 
ENGINE DRIVEN PULSE TYPE FUEL PUMP HAD BEEN REPLACED 147 HOURS 
PREVIOUS IN ANOTHER POWER LOSS OCCURRENCE.  THE PILOT REPORTED THAT 
INSUFFICIENT FUEL PUMP PRESSURE RESULTED IN FUEL STARVATION AND THE 
SUBSEQUENT POWER LOSS. 
 THE FUEL PUMP DELIVERING TOO LOW FUEL PRESSURE.  A FACTOR CONTRIBUTING 
TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE SNOW COVERED TERRAIN.
