 THE CERTIFICATED PRIVATE PILOT AND A PASSENGER DEPARTED A COASTAL 
AIRPORT ON A NIGHT CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT TO SO. LAKE TAHOE, CA, WITH A 
PLANNED TIME ENROUTE OF 3 HOURS.  ABOUT 6 HOURS AFTER THE ESTIMATED 
DEPARTURE TIME, THE PILOT CONTACTED A FLIGHT SERVICE STATION, REPORTING 
THAT HE WAS LOST AND WAS ON TOP OF AN OVERCAST IN INSTRUMENT 
METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS WITH LESS THAN ONE HOUR OF FUEL REMAINING.  
THROUGH COMMUNICATIONS EFFORTS RADAR CONTACT WITH SEATTLE CENTER 
WAS ESTABLISHED; THE AIRPLANE WAS LOCATED ABOUT 110 MILES WEST OF THE 
U.S. COAST LINE AND GIVEN RADAR VECTORS TO RETURN TO THE COAST.  ABOUT 15 
MINUTES AFTER RADAR CONTACT, THE PILOT REPORTED FUEL EXHAUSTION, AND 
INDICATED THAT NO SURVIVAL EQUIPMENT WAS ON BOARD THE AIRPLANE.  RADAR 
CONTACT WAS LOST WHEN THE AIRPLANE WAS ABOUT 70 MILES WEST OF THE 
COAST LINE.  A SEARCH FAILED TO LOCATE THE AIRPLANE.  THE PILOT AND 
PASSENGER ARE PRESUMED TO HAVE RECEIVED FATAL INJURIES AND THAT THE 
AIRPLANE WAS DESTROYED.
 THE FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO ADEQUATELY EVALUATE THE WEATHER 
CONDITIONS, AND CONTINUED VFR FLIGHT INTO IMC CONDITIONS WHICH 
RESULTED IN THE PILOT BECOMING LOST AND DISORIENTED. CONTRIBUTING TO 
THE ACCIDENT WAS THE LACK OF TOTAL AERONAUTICAL EXPERIENCE AND FUEL 
EXHAUSTION.
