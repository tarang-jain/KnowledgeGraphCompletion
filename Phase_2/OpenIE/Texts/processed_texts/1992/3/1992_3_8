 THE NOSE LANDING GEAR COLLAPSED AFTER IT WAS LOWERED TO THE RUNWAY 
DURING THE LANDING ROLL.  EXAM OF THE NOSE LANDING GEAR ASSY BY AN FAA 
MAINTENANCE INSPECTOR INDICATED THAT THE NOSE LANDING GEAR ACTUATOR 
WAS NOT DAMAGED. IT WAS REMOVED FOR EXAM.  DISASSEMBLY REVEALED THAT 
AN EXTRA PACKING (SIMILAR TO AN O-RING) WAS INSTALLED.  THIS ALLOWED THE 
NOSE LANDING GEAR DOWN AND LOCKED LIGHT TO ILLUMINATE BUT SHUT THE 
MOTOR OFF BEFORE THE NOSE LANDING GEAR WAS FULLY EXTENDED.  REVIEW OF 
THE AIRPLANE LOGBOOKS INDICATE THAT A PROGRESSIVE INSPECTION WAS 
SIGNED OFF TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. DURING THE INSPECTION IT WAS 
NOTED THAT THE NOSE LANDING GEAR ACTUATOR SWITCH WAS LEAKING.  THE 
CORRECTIVE ACTION INDICATES THAT THE O-RINGS WERE REPLACED.  ACCORDING 
TO THE ILLUSTRATED PARTS LIST OF THE NOSE LANDING GEAR ACTUATOR, TWO 
PACKINGS ARE INSTALLED.  ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTOR OF MAINTENANCE, THE 
MECHANIC RESPONSIBLE FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE PACKINGS WAS PROVIDED 
WITH TWO, BUT ONLY REMOVED ONE FROM THE ACTUATOR.  THIS RESULTED IN 
THE EXTRA PACKING.  THE AIRCRAFT HAD ACCUMULATED 4 HRS AND 6 CYCLES SINCE THE 
INSPECTION 2 DAYS EARLIER. 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
 IMPROPER OVERHAUL BY COMPANY MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL AND INACCURATE 
GEAR DOWN AND LOCKED INDICATION IN THE COCKPIT.
