 THE CERTIFICATED AIRLINE TRANSPORT PILOT AND A PASSENGER WERE 
CONDUCTING A LOW LEVEL FLIGHT OVER MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN. THE SURFACE 
WIND CONDITIONS WERE REPORTED TO BE FROM THE SOUTH AT OR ABOVE 20 
KNOTS.  THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE APPROACHED THE MOUNTAIN PEAK IN A 
SOUTHERLY DIRECTION AND CLIMBED THE AIRPLANE TO AN ALTITUDE OF 150 FEET 
ABOVE THE GROUND TO CLEAR THE MOUNTAIN.  THE AIRPLANE ENCOUNTERED 
DOWNDRAFT CONDITIONS ON THE LEE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN.  THE PILOT FAILED 
TO IMMEDIATELY CORRECT FOR THIS CONDITION AND THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED 
WITH THE UPSLOPING MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN WHEN THE PILOT WAS EXECUTING 
A 180 DEGREE TURN. 
 THE PILOT'S INADEQUATE IN-FLIGHT PLANNING, IMPROPER ALTITUDE, AND 
DELAYING THE REQUIRED REMEDIAL ACTION TO PREVENT THE COLLISION WITH 
THE MOUNTAIN. CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE UNFAVORABLE WIND 
AND DOWNDRAFT CONDITIONS.
