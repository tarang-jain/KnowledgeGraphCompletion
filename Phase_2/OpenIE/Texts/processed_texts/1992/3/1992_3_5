RIGHT BANKING TURN TO ALIGN WITH RUNWAY 17. DURING THE ROLL OUT THE 
GLIDER STALLED. THE RIGHT WING STRUCK THE GRASS TERRAIN FOLLOWED BY 
THE FUSELAGE. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE MADE A MISTAKE BY GETTING TOO 
LOW AND SLOW AND BANKING TOO STEEPLY DURING THE TURN WHILE LANDING. 
 THE PILOT IN COMMAND INADVERTENTLY STALLING THE AIRCRAFT. FACTORS 
WERE THE PILOT NOT MAINTAINING PROPER ALTITUDE DURING THE APPROACH 
AND HIS ABRUPT AIRCRAFT HANDLING.
