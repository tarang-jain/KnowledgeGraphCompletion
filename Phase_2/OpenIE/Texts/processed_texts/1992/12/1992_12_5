 THE PRIVATE PILOT STATED HE ATTEMPTED TO LAND LONG ON A SHORT, WET SOD 
RUNWAY WITH A TAILWIND. HE REALIZED HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO STOP THE 
AIRPLANE, AND HE EXECUTED AN INTENTIONAL GROUND LOOP TO AVOID TREES AT 
THE END OF THE RUNWAY. THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER AND THE WING WAS 
SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED. 
 THE IMPROPER IN FLIGHT DECISION OF THE PILOT IN COMMAND TO ATTEMPT A 
LONG LANDING, DOWNWIND ON A SHORT WET SOD RUNWAY. CONTRIBUTING TO 
THE ACCIDENT WAS THE FAILURE OF THE PILOT IN COMMAND TO EXECUTE A GO 
AROUND WHEN OBSERVING THE WIND AND LANDING CONDITIONS.
