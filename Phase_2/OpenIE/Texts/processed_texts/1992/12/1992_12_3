 JUST AFTER LIFTOFF THE LEFT CABIN DOOR POPPED OPEN.  THE PILOT STATED 
THAT DUE TO THE WIND IN THE AIRPLANE HE WAS UNABLE TO LOOK UP AND OUT 
OF THE WINDSHIELD.  THE AIRPLANE TRAVELED TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE 
AIRPORT WHERE IT CONTACTED TREE TOPS; HOWEVER, THE PILOT WAS ABLE TO 
PULL UP AND KEEP THE AIRPLANE FLYING.  THE PILOT THEN FLEW ACROSS THE 
AIRPORT PROPERTY TO THE NORTH WHERE THE AIRPLANE JUST CLEARED A HOTEL 
ROOF PRIOR TO CONTACTING A TREE AND DESCENDING TO THE GROUND.  THE 
AIRPLANE CAME TO REST JUST OUTSIDE THE AIRPORT BOUNDARY. 
 THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN A PROPER ALTITUDE.
