 THE STUDENT PILOT WAS PRACTICING A SOFT FIELD LANDING WHEN THE 
ACCIDENT OCCURRED.  HE STATED THAT WHILE KEEPING THE NOSE OFF THE 
GROUND THE AIRPLANE DRIFTED TO THE LEFT OF THE RUNWAY.  HE ALSO STATED 
THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT HE APPLIED LEFT RUDDER AS HE WAS 
CONCENTRATING ON KEEPING THE NOSE OFF THE GROUND.  THE STUDENT THEN 
APPLIED RIGHT RUDDER BUT STATED THIS HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON STOPPING THE 
DRIFT.  THE AIRPLANE CONTACTED A SNOWBANK ALONGSIDE THE RUNWAY AND 
NOSED DOWN. 
 THE PILOT'S IMPROPER USE OF RUDDER CONTROL AND SUBSEQUENT FAILURE TO 
MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL.
