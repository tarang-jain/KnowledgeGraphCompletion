 THE FLIGHT DEPARTED WITH 10 GALLONS OF FUEL TOWARD A MOUNTAINOUS 
AREA DURING A DARK NIGHT.  WHILE ENROUTE THE PILOT BECAME LOST AND 
DISORIENTED. HE CONTACTED THE TRACON AND REPORTED A LOW FUEL STATE.  
THE CONTROLLER VECTORED THE FLIGHT TO THE NEAREST AIRPORT.  THE PILOT 
COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE AIRPORT OR TURN ON THE RUNWAY LIGHTS WHILE 
CIRCLING OVER THE AIRPORT. IN AN ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY THE AIRPORT, THE 
PILOT DESCENDED TOWARD THE AIRPORT.  DURING THE DESCENT THE AIRPLANE 
STRUCK SOME POWER LINES.  THERE WAS NO POST IMPACT FIRE ALTHOUGH THE 
TWO PASSENGERS SUSTAINED BURNS ON THEIR ARMS FROM THE SEVERED POWER 
LINES.  THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE RUNWAY LIGHTS ACTIVATED 
NORMALLY BY CLICKING THE MICROPHONE USING THE COMMON TRAFFIC 
ADVISORY FREQUENCY AS INDICATED IN THE AIRPORT/FACILITY DIRECTORY. 
 THE PILOT'S POOR PREFLIGHT PLANNING/PREPARATION, POOR FUEL 
CONSUMPTION CALCULATIONS, AND DELAY IN EFFECTING ANY REMEDIAL ACTION.  
CONTRIBUTING TO THIS ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT INADVERTENTLY BECOMING 
LOST/DISORIENTED AND THE DARK NIGHT.
