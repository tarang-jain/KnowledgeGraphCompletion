 THE PILOT STATED THAT HE LANDED AND ATTEMPTED TO RETRACT THE FLAPS. 
WHILE ATTENTIVE TO THE FLAP SWITCH, WHICH APPEARED TO BE STUCK, THE 
PILOT SAID, THE AIRPLANE BECAME AIRBORNE, AGAIN. IT WAS RE-LANDED, WHICH 
DAMAGED THE NOSE LANDING GEAR. THE AIRPLANE THEN PORPOISED, BOUNCED 
TWICE, AND ON THE THIRD LANDING, HIT HARD. DIRECTIONAL CONTROL WAS LOST AND 
THE AIRPLANE VEERED TO THE RIGHT INTO TREES. 
 THE PILOT'S DIVERTED ATTENTION WHICH RESULTED IN THE IMPROPER USE OF 
THE ELEVATOR AND INADVERTENT PORPOISE.
