 THE NON-INSTRUMENT RATED PILOT INTENDED A DAYTIME CROSS COUNTRY 
FLIGHT. THE PASSENGER ARRIVED LATE, AND THE AIRPLANE DEPARTED AFTER 
SUNSET.  NO RECORD OF A WEATHER BRIEF WAS FOUND.  TWO HOURS AFTER 
TAKEOFF, THE FLIGHT ENENTERED AN AREA OF THUNDERSHOWERS AND HEAVY 
RAIN.  RESIDENTS NEAR THE CRASH SITE HEARD THE LOUD ENGINE NOISE OF AN 
AIRPLANE PASSING LOW OVERHEAD.  THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH TREES WHILE 
HEADING AWAY FROM ITS DESTINATION IN A SHALLOW DESCENT, WITH 40 
DEGREES RIGHT BANK. 
 THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AIRCRAFT CONTROL.
