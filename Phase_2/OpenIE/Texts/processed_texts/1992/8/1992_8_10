 THE PILOT WAS LANDING WHEN A GUST OF WIND CAUSED THE AIRPLANE TO DROP 
TO THE RUNWAY FROM 10 FEET.  THE AIRPLANE BOUNCED BACK INTO THE AIR AND 
WAS POINTED TOWARD SOME TREES ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY.  THE 
PILOT APPLIED POWER AND INITIATED A GO-AROUND.  HE SAID HE TURNED RIGHT, 
HOWEVER THE AIRPLANE CONTINUED TO DRIFT LEFT AND STRUCK THE TREES 60 
FEET LEFT OF THE RUNWAY, AT A HEIGHT OF 30 TO 40 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. 
 A COLLISION WITH TREES AFTER THE PILOT FAILED TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL 
CONTROL DURING AN ABORTED LANDING.
