 THE HOMEBUILT AIRPLANE WAS OBSERVED PERFORMING A LOW PASS TO THE 
RUNWAY. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE LOW PASS, THE AIRPLANE BEGAN A 
CLIMBING LEFT TURN.  AS THE AIRPLANE GAINED ALTITUDE IT BEGAN TO SLOW 
DOWN ACCORDING TO WITNESSES.  AT AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF 300 TO 400 
FEET ABOVE THE GROUND THE AIRPLANE ROLLED TO THE RIGHT, PERFORMING A 
HALF TURN SPIN BEFORE COLLIDING WITH THE GROUND.  THE ON SCENE 
INVESTIGATION REVEALED NO MECHANICAL DISCREPANCIES WITH THE AIRFRAME 
OR POWER PLANT.  THE AIRPLANE'S ENGINE ROTATED OPPOSITE THE NORMAL U.S. 
CERTIFIED AIRPLANE ENGINES. DURING THE INVESTIGATION IT WAS REVEALED 
THE PILOT DID NOT HAVE EXPERIENCE IN THE AIRPLANE.  AN EYE WITNESS STATED 
HE HAD SPOKEN WITH THE PILOT BEFORE THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT AND ADVISED 
HIM TO OBTAIN SOME DUAL INSTRUCTION BEFORE FLYING THE AIRPLANE SOLO; OR 
AT LEAST DO SOME TOUCH AND GO'S BEFORE GOING ANYWHERE IN THE AIRPLANE.  
THE PILOT'S LOGBOOK REVEALED HE HAD NO TIME LOGGED IN THE MAKE AND 
MODEL AIRPLANE. 
 THE PILOT'S OVER-CONFIDENCE IN HIS PERSONAL ABILITY, HIS LACK OF 
EXPERIENCE IN THE TYPE AIRPLANE HE WAS FLYING, AND THE FACT THE PILOT DID 
NOT MAINTAIN A PROPER AIRSPEED.
