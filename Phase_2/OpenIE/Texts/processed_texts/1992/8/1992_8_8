 THE OWNER, SEATED IN THE RIGHT SEAT ALLOWED A PROSPECTIVE BUYER SEATED 
IN THE LEFT SEAT TO MAKE THE TAKEOFF.  AFTER GETTING AIRBORNE, THE 
AIRPLANE WAS OBSERVED TO PITCH UP TO A NEAR VERTICAL ATTITUDE, FALL OFF 
ON A WING AND THEN STRIKE THE GROUND NOSE FIRST.  THE PROSPECTIVE BUYER 
HAD NO PREVIOUS TIME IN THE AIRPLANE, AND WAS A PRIVATE PILOT WITH 150 
HOURS TOTAL TIME.  THE OWNER/OPERATOR HAS LESS THAN 100 HOURS TOTAL 
TIME AND WAS UNRESTRAINED IN THE AIRPLANE WHICH WAS EQUIPPED WITH 
ONLY ONE SET OF SEAT BELTS. 
 IMPROPER USE OF THE FLIGHT CONTROLS BY THE PROSPECTIVE BUYER, AND THE 
FAILURE OF THE OWNER/OPERATOR TO ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE THE 
PROSPECTIVE BUYER.  FACTORS RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE THE LACK OF 
EXPERIENCE IN TYPE OF AIRPLANE FOR THE PROSPECTIVE BUYER, AND THE LACK 
OF A RESTRAINT SYSTEM FOR THE PASSENGER.
