THE AIRPLANE WAS OBSERVED TO ENTER THE TRAFFIC PATTERN ON AN UPWIND 
LEG, THEN TURN LEFT ON THE CROSSWIND LEG. HOWEVER, IT REMAINED IN THE 
TURN WHICH INCREASED IN BANK, AND IT STARTED TO DESCEND. NO CHANGE IN 
POWER WAS HEARD AS THE AIRPLANE CONTINUED TO TURN AND DESCEND. IT 
STRUCK THE GROUND IN A LEFT WING LOW ATTITUDE AFTER COMPLETING OVER 
180 DEG OF TURN. THE PILOT WAS BEING TREATED FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. IN 
ADDITION, THE AUTOPSY REVEALED EXTENSIVE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE AND 
EVIDENCE OF PREVIOUS HEART ATTACKS. 
A LOSS OF CONTROL IN FLIGHT DUE TO PILOT INCAPACITATION AS A RESULT OF A 
HEART ATTACK.
