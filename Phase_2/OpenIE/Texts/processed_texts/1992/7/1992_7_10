 THE PILOT DEPARTED AT NIGHT IN INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS 
WITHOUT A FLIGHT PLAN.  ABOUT TEN MINUTES AFTER TAKEOFF, THE PILOT 
REALIZED WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE 'FAR POORER' THAN EXPECTED AND THE 
FOG WAS HAMPERING HIS VISION. HE CHOSE TO RETURN TO THE DEPARTURE 
AIRPORT, AND WAS IN A LEFT HAND TURN WHEN THE AIRPLANE IMPACTED TREES.  
THE PILOT STATED DUE TO THE POOR WEATHER HIS ATTENTION WAS DIVERTED 
FROM NAVIGATION.  THE AIRPLANE HAD WANDERED SEVERAL MILES OFF COURSE, 
INTO AN AREA OF HIGHER TERRAIN.  A POST-IMPACT GROUND FIRE ENSUED. 
 THE PILOT'S POOR PLANNING/DECISION MAKING.  RELATED FACTORS ARE THE 
LOW CEILINGS AND FOG, THE DARK NIGHT, THE PILOT'S INACCURATE WEATHER 
EVALUATION AND DIVERTED ATTENTION, AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN 
CLEARANCE FROM THE HIGHER TERRAIN ENCOUNTERED.
