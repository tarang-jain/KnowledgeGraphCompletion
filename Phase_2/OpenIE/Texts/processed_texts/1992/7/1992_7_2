 THE HOMEBUILT ACCIDENT AIRPLANE LOST ENGINE POWER DURING INITIAL 
CLIMB FROM TAKEOFF.  IT COLLIDED WITH TREES AND TERRAIN DURING A FORCED 
LANDING. THE PILOT DESCRIBED HOW HE HAD BEEN FLYING ABOUT 45 MINUTES 
AND HAD DONE TWO LANDINGS AND TAKEOFFS.  DURING THE THIRD TAKEOFF THE 
AIRPLANE HAD CLIMBED ABOUT 75 TO 100 FEET WHEN THE ENGINE LOST POWER. 
EXAMINATION OF THE CARBURETOR AIR BOX REVEALED A FLAPPER VALVE IN THE 
AIR BOX HAD BROKEN. THE VALVE PLATE WAS FREE TO MOVE ABOUT IN THE SPACE 
BETWEEN THE SHAFT AND THE CARBURETOR AIR INTAKE.  THE PLATE HAD BEEN 
SECURED TO THE SHAFT WITH TWO SPOT WELDS.  THE SURFACE OF THE BROKEN 
WELDS APPEARED DULL EXCEPT FOR A SMALL PORTION ON ONE WELD WHERE THE 
BREAK APPEARED SHINY.  THE CARBURETOR AIR BOX HAD BEEN PURCHASED FROM 
AN AIRCRAFT SALVAGE OPERATOR FOR INSTALLATION ON THE AIRPLANE. 
 A LOSS OF TOTAL ENGINE POWER WHEN A FAILED FLAPPER VALVE IN THE AIR BOX 
BLOCKED THE FLOW OF AIR THROUGH THE CARBURETOR THROAT.
