 THE PRIVATE PILOT WAS ABOUT 4 HOURS INTO THE CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT WHEN 
THE ENGINE SPUTTERED, THEN QUIT. UNABLE TO GLIDE TO HIS DESTINATION 
AIRPORT, HE FORCE LANDED THE AIRPLANE IN AN ADJACENT FIELD. ON THE 
LANDING ROLL, THE NOSE GEAR FRACTURED, AND THE AIRCRAFT NOSED DOWN. 
THE PILOT STATED THAT HE HAD EXHAUSTED HIS FUEL SUPPLY. HE REPORTEDLY 
BEGAN THE FLIGHT WITH 4 HOURS OF FUEL PLUS A 45 MINUTE RESERVE, HOWEVER 
THERE WAS ONLY 1 TO 2 QUARTS OF FUEL REMAINING IN EACH WING TANK. 
 THE INADEQUATE PREFLIGHT PLANNING BY THE PILOT WHICH RESULTED IN FUEL 
EXHAUSTION DUE TO AN INADEQUATE SUPPLY OF FUEL. A FACTOR WAS THE SOFT 
TERRAIN AT THE FORCED LANDING SITE.
