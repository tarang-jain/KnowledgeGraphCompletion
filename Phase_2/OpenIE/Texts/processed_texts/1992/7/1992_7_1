WHILE IN CRUISE AT 12,000 FEET MSL THE ENGINE LOST TOTAL POWER. THE PILOT 
MADE A FORCED LANDING ON A FIELD IN GREENVILLE, VA. THE ON SCENE 
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE FUEL INJECTOR LINE BETWEEN THE FUEL 
MANIFOLD AND THE NUMBER 6 CYLINDER FUEL NOZZLE WAS BROKEN. A 
METALLURGICAL STUDY REVEALED THAT THE SEPARATION OF THE FUEL LINE 
OCCURRED BY METAL FATIGUE. THE SAFETY BOARD RECOMMENDED TO THE FAA, 
RECOMMENDATION A-29-10, ON MARCH 2, 1992, THAT AN AIRWORTHINESS 
DIRECTIVE (A) BE PUBLISHED ADDRESSING THE FUEL LINE FAILURES. THE FAA 
ISSUED AN AD (92-12-10), ON JUNE 5, 1992, REQUIRING A VISUAL INSPECTION, 
WITHIN 10 FLIGHT HOURS, OF EACH FUEL INJECTOR FUEL LINE, AND LOOK FOR 
MISSING SUPPORT CLAMPS, OR SUPPORT CLAMPS THAT ARE NOT SECURE AND ARE 
NOT PROPERLY SUPPORTING THE FUEL LINE. THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE HAD NOT 
YET ACCRUED 10 FLIGHT HOURS SINCE THE ADOPTION OF THE AD. 
 THE FATIGUE FAILURE OF THE FUEL INJECTOR FUEL LINE RESULTING IN ENGINE 
FAILURE.  CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE UNSUITABLE TERRAIN IN 
WHICH THE FORCED LANDING WAS MADE.
