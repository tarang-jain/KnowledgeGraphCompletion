 THE ENGINE QUIT WITH A LOUD BANG ABOUT 15 MINUTES INTO THE CROSS 
COUNTRY FLIGHT. THE AIRCRAFT WAS OVER MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN AND THE 
PILOT ATTEMPTED TO LAND IN A SMALL PASTURE. THE AIRCRAFT ENCOUNTERED 
ROUGH TERRAIN DURING THE LANDING ROLL OUT AND NOSED OVER. 
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE NUMBER 2 MAIN BEARING HAD SPUN, 
CLOSING OFF THE INTERNAL OIL PASSAGE IN THE CRANKSHAFT AND JOURNAL. THE 
ENGINE SUSTAINED A RESULTING OIL STARVATION FAILURE OF THE NUMBER 2 AND 
3 CONNECTING RODS. REVIEW OF THE MAINTENANCE RECORDS ESTABLISHED THAT 
A MAINTENANCE FACILITY HAD FOUND A LARGE AMOUNT OF METAL PARTICLES IN 
THE OIL 40 HOURS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. THE MAINTENANCE FACILITY WARNED 
THE PILOT ABOUT THE EXCESSIVE INTERNAL ENGINE WEAR, RECOMMENDING 
'FURTHER INSPECTION PRIOR TO FLIGHT.' NO CORRECTIVE ACTION ENTRIES WERE 
NOTED IN THE LOGBOOK. THE ENGINE WAS FOUND TO HAVE ACCRUED 1,520 HOURS 
SINCE OVERHAUL. THE MANUFACTURER RECOMMENDS A TIME BETWEEN 
OVERHAUL INTERVAL OF 1,700 HOURS. 
 THE FAILURE OF THE ENGINE DUE TO THE SLIPPAGE OF THE NUMBER 2 MAIN 
BEARING AND THE RESULTANT OIL STARVATION FAILURE OF THE NUMBER 2 
CONNECTING ROD. THE NUMBER 2 MAIN BEARING SLIPPAGE WAS CAUSED BY THE 
FAILURE OF THE PILOT/OWNER TO OVERHAUL THE ENGINE IN A TIMELY FASHION 
WHEN INTERNAL WEAR PATTERNS INDICATED THAT A POTENTIAL BEARING 
PROBLEM EXISTED.  A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT WAS THE UNSUITABLE NATURE OF 
THE TERRAIN FOR A FORCED LANDING.
