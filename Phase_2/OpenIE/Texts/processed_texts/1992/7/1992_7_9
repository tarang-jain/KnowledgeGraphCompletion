 DURING A CERTIFICATION TEST FLIGHT INVOLVING A SERIES OF DESCENTS AT LOW 
ROTOR RPM AND LOW AIRSPEEDS, THE ENGINE OF THE PROTOTYPE HELICOPTER 
LOST POWER.  AN AUTOROTATION WAS INITIATED AND THE AIRCRAFT IMPACTED 
THE GROUND IN A TAIL LOW CONDITION, CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE TAIL ROTOR 
AND MAIN ROTOR.  THE AIRCRAFT WAS BEING OPERATED AT A HIGH GROSS WEIGHT 
AND AFT CENTER OF GRAVITY TO MEET CERTIFICATION CRITERIA.  THE RIGGING 
BETWEEN THE THROTTLE AND FUEL CONTROL UNIT WAS EXAMINED AND FOUND 
TO BE IMPROPERLY SET, CAUSING THE PREVENTION OF CONTINUOUS ENGINE 
POWER THROUGHOUT THE FLIGHT TEST PROFILE. 
 FUEL STARVATION AS A RESULT OF IMPROPER RIGGING OF THE FUEL CONTROL 
UNIT.
