THE CESSNA 206 CARRYING A FUEL BARREL REPORTEDLY STRUCK A STUMP ON 
TAKEOFF FROM REMOTE RIVER GRAVEL STRIP, THEN COLLIDED WITH TERRAIN 
WHICH DAMAGED THE LANDING GEAR, FUSELAGE AND HORIZONTAL STABILIZER. 
THE PILOT IN COMMAND TOLD THE INVESTIGATOR THAT THOUGH HE WALKED THE 
RUNWAY LOOKING FOR HAZARDS, HE DID NOT SEE THE HAZARDS IN THE TAKEOFF 
AREA. INFORMATION WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO VALIDATE THE DETAILS OF 
ACCIDENT. THE PILOT DID NOT RETURN TO WORK. NO WITNESSES TO THE 
ACCIDENT WERE FOUND. 
 PILOT IN COMMAND'S POOR PREFLIGHT PLANNING.  A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT 
WAS THE HAZARDS ON OR NEAR THE GRAVEL BAR STRIP TAKEOFF AREA.
