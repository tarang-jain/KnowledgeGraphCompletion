 IMMEDIATELY AFTER LIFT OFF, FROM A WET GRASS RUNWAY, THE PILOT ABORTED 
THE TAKE OFF.  THE PILOT STATED THAT ONCE AIRBORNE, THE AIRPLANE FELT 
'TOO MUSHY' AND THAT HIS RATE OF CLIMB WOULD NOT ALLOW THE AIRPLANE TO 
CLEAR THE WIRES AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY.  THE AIRPLANE OVERRAN THE 
DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY, SLID ACROSS A ROAD AND IMPACTED AN 
EMBANKMENT.  A POST CRASH FIRE CONSUMED THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND 
THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. 
THE PILOT'S PREMATURE LIFTOFF AND DELAY IN ABORTING THE TAKEOFF.
