 THE COMMERCIAL PILOT WAS LANDING ON RUNWAY 7 WHEN A DEER ENTERED THE 
RUNWAY. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE PULLED UP ON THE CONTROL YOKE TO 
AVOID HITTING THE DEER; HOWEVER, THE DEER STRUCK THE HORIZONTAL 
STABILIZER CAUSING HIM TO LOSE PITCH CONTROL. HE STATED THAT HE ADDED 
POWER TO CUSHION HIS DESCENT DURING THE SECOND TOUCHDOWN ATTEMPT, 
BUT THE AIRCRAFT ASCENDED INTO THE AIR. THIS ACTION CONTINUED FOR ABOUT 
EIGHT TIMES UNTIL THE LEFT MAIN GEAR BROKE OFF AND THE AIRCRAFT SLID TO A 
STOP OFF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY. 
 DEER ON THE RUNWAY. OTHER RELATED FACTOR WS A DARK NIGHT.
