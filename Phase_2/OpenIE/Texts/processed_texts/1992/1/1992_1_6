FIELD SIX MILES FROM THE AIRPORT.  LANDING GEAR WAS UP, FLAPS WERE DOWN. 
FISHERMAN NEARBY REPORTED HEARING THE AIRCRAFT MANEUVERING AT LOW 
ALTITUDE.  HE REPORTED THAT THE ENGINES SOUNDED FINE, BUT THE SOUND 
WAS CHANGING IN PITCH AND INTENSITY.  HE REPORTED THAT GOT QUIET JUST A 
FEW SECONDS BEFORE HE HEARD THE IMPACT.  THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED 
THAT THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF A FIRE IN THE NOSE BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT.

RECENT HISTORY OF DISCREPANCIES. 
 AN INFLIGHT FIRE WITH THE CABIN HEATER AS THE ORIGIN, AND UNSUITABLE 
TERRAIN IN WHICH TO MAKE A FORCED LANDING.  A FACTOR RELATED TO THE 
ACCIDENT WAS THE SOFT TERRAIN.
