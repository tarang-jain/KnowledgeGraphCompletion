 WEATHER CONDITIONS ALONG THE AIRCRAFT'S FLIGHT ROUTE WERE CONDUCIVE 
TO CARBURETOR ICING.  THE PILOT ENTERED AN AUROTATIVE DESCENT WITHOUT 
APPLYING FULL CARBURETOR HEAT AS RECOMMENDED BY THE AIRCRAFT 
MANUFACTURER. THE ENGINE FAILED DURING THE DESCENT AND THE 
HELICOPTER LANDED HARD AND ROLLED OVER ON ITS SIDE.  THE PILOT HAD 
RECEIVED MOST OF HIS FLIGHT EXPERIENCE IN TURBINE POWERED HELICOPTERS. 
 THE PILOT'S IMPROPER USE OF THE CARBURETOR HEAT CONTROL AND DELAY IN 
FLARING THE HELICOPTER FOR AN AUTOROTATIVE TOUCHDOWN. CARBURETOR 
ICING CONDITIONS AND THE SOFT TERRAIN WERE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS IN THE 
ACCIDENT.
