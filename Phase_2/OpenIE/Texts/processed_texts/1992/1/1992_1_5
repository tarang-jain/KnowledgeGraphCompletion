 AT THE BEGINNING OF AN UNSCHEDULED CARGO FLIGHT WITH A FLOAT EQUIPPED 
AIRPLANE, THE AIRPLANE'S FLOATS STRUCK A WAVE JUST AFTER TAKEOFF. THE 
FLYING WIRES ON BOTH FLOATS BROKE LOOSE AND STRUCK THE AIRPLANE. THE 
FLIGHT CONTINUED TO ITS FINAL DESTINATION FOR A LANDING WITHOUT 
FURTHER INCIDENT. 
 THE DESIGN STRESS LIMITS OF THE AIRPLANE WERE EXCEEDED.  A FACTOR TO THE 
ACCIDENT WAS: ROUGH WATER.
