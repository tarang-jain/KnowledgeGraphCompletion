AFTER LIFT-OFF, THE AIRPLANE WAS OBSERVED TO CLIMB TO AN ESTIMATED 
ALTITUDE OF 300-400 FEET AGL BEFORE TURNING RIGHT AND DESCENDING INTO 
TREES. THE WITNESS STATED THAT THE HORIZON WAS OBSCURED FROM HIS 
LOCATION, AND THAT THE LIGHTS FROM THE CITY WERE OBSCURED BY LOW 
STRATUS CLOUDS AND FOG. PRIOR TO TAKEOFF THE PILOT HAD ACKNOWLEDGED 
RECEIVING THE CURRENT ATIS INFORMATION WHICH REPORTED SCATTERED 
CLOUDS AT 500 FEET AND A FOG BANK NORTHWEST THROUGH EAST, VISIBILITY 
NORTHWEST 2 MI, VISIBILITY EAST 3 MI. 
THE PILOT BECAME SPATIALLY DISORIENTED AND LOST CONTROL OF THE 
AIRPLANE AS HE TURNED AWAY FROM GROUND LIGHTS TOWARD UNLIGHTED 
TERRAIN. THE CLOUDS, FOG, AND DARK NIGHT CONDITION WERE FACTORS.
