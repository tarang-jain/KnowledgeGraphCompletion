DURING CLIMB, THE CREW NOTED AN ELECTRICAL ARCING SOUND AND SLIGHT 
ELECTRICAL-TYPE BURNING ODOR WHILE PASSING THROUGH FLIGHT LEVEL 180. 
EMERGENCY PROCEDURES WERE COMPLIED WITH AND THE PROBLEM APPEARED 
TO BE SOLVED. THE CLIMB WAS CONTINUED, AND WHILE PASSING THROUGH 
FLIGHT LEVEL 330 A LOUD ARCING SOUND WAS AGAIN HEARD ACCOMPANIED BY 
FLAMES FROM THE FLIGHT DECK AFT OVERHEAD PANEL. THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS 
EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE, AND THE FLIGHT RETURNED TO DENVER AND LANDED 
WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. EXAMINATION DISCLOSED A SHORT IN A WIRE 
BUNDLE. THE BUNDLE WAS NOT SHIELDED OR ANCHORED AS THE OTHER MAJOR 
BUNDLE IN THE COMPARTMENT. THE SHORT WAS DUE TO THE BUNDLE CHAFING 
ON THE FLIGHT DECK ENTRY DOOR FRAME. IN ADDITION, TESTING REVEALED THAT 
THE WIRE GAUGE USED IN PART OF THIS APPLICATION WAS INSUFFICIENT FOR THE 
ELECTRICAL LOAD. 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
AN ELECTRICAL SHORT CIRCUIT IN A MAIN WIRE BUNDLE DUE TO CHAFING OF THE 
BUNDLE ON AIRFRAME STRUCTURAL MEMBERS.
