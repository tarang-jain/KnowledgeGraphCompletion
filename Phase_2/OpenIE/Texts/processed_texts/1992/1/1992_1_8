AFTER A NORMAL LANDING WAS MADE, THE PILOT STATED THAT ON TOUCHDOWN, 
THE CARBURETOR HEAT WAS TURNED OFF, THE FLAPS WERE RETRACTED, AND 
POWER WAS INCREASED FOR THE TAKEOFF. WHEN FULL POWER WAS ADDED, THE 
AIRPLANE VEERED TO THE LEFT. THE PILOT CORRECTED WITH RIGHT RUDDER 
CONTROL; HOWEVER, THE AIRPLANE CONTINUED TO THE LEFT UNTIL IT EXITED 
THE RUNWAY AND COLLIDED WITH A SNOWBANK.  THE PILOT STATED THAT HE WAS 
NOT SURE IF HE APPLIED THE BRAKE AND HE DID NOT DECREASE POWER, AS THE 
OCCURRENCE HAPPENED SO FAST. 
 DIRECTIONAL CONTROL WAS NOT MAINTAINED.  A FACTOR TO THE ACCIDENT WAS: 
THE PILOT'S LACK OF TOTAL FLIGHT EXPERIENCE.
