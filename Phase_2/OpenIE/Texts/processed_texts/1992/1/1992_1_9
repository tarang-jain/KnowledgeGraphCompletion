ON IFR ARRIVAL, FLIGHT 4821 WAS CLEARED TO INTERSECTION 17 NE OF AIRPORT AT 
6000', THEN FOR ILS RUNWAY 23 APPROACH. RADAR SERVICE WAS TERMINATED 6.5 
EAST OF INTERSECTION.  RADAR DATA SHOWED THAT FLIGHT CROSSED AND THEN 
BRACKETED LOCALIZER. FLIGHT INTERCEPTED GLIDE SLOPE FROM BELOW ABOUT 7 
MI OUTSIDE OF OUTER MARKER AND THENCE DEVIATED ABOVE GLIDE SLOPE. ABOUT 2 
MILES OUTSIDE OF MARKER, FLIGHT WAS AT A FULL FLY DOWN DEFLECTION WHEN 
IT ENTERED A DESCENT VARYING FROM 1200 TO 2000 FPM. AIRCRAFT STRUCK 
WOODED MOUNTAIN TOP 2.0 MI INSIDE OF OUTER MARKER (3.9 MI FROM RUNWAY) AT 
ELEVATION OF 2280'. MINIMUM ALTITUDE AT MARKER WAS 3600'. GLIDE SLOPE 
ELEVATION AT POINT OF IMPACT WAS APPROXIMATELY 2900'. EVIDENCE WAS FOUND OF 
INADEQUATE ELECTRICAL GROUND PATH BETWEEN RADOME AND FUSELAGE WHICH, 
WHEN COMBINED WITH EXISTING WEATHER CONDITIONS, MAY HAVE PRODUCED 
ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE (PRECIPITATION STATIC). ALTHOUGH POST-ACCIDENT 
TESTS WERE NOT CONCLUSIVE, THE SAFETY BOARD BELIEVES THAT THE GLIDE 
SLOPE INDICATIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNRELIABLE DUE TO PRECIPITATION 
STATIC INTERFERENCE. 
FAILURE OF THE CAPTAIN TO ESTABLISH A STABILIZED APPROACH, HIS 
INADEQUATE CROSS-CHECK OF INSTRUMENTS, HIS DESCENT BELOW SPECIFIED 
MINIMUM ALTITUDE AT THE FINAL APPROACH FIX, AND FAILURE OF THE COPILOT 
TO MONITOR THE APPROACH.  FACTORS RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: 
WEATHER CONDITIONS AND POSSIBLE PRECIPITATION STATIC INTERFERENCE, 
CAUSED BY INADEQUATE GROUNDING BETWEEN THE RADOME AND FUSELAGE 
THAT COULD HAVE RESULTED IN UNRELIABLE GLIDE SLOPE INDICATIONS.
