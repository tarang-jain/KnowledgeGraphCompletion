 AFTER LOWERING COLLECTIVE CONTROL TO PERFORM A SIMULATED 
AUTOROTATIVE LANDING WITH FULL THROTTLE APPLIED, THE CFI OBSERVED THAT 
THE ENG RPM DROPPED TO ZERO AND THE MANIFOLD PRESSURE GAUGE INDICATED 
30 INCHES.  DURING THE EMERGENCY DESCENT AT AN ALTITUDE OF 100 FEET, HE 
OBSERVED POWER LINES AHEAD.  HE PULLED COLLECTIVE CONTROL AND CLEARED 
THE LINES BUT THE HELICOPTER LANDED HARD RIGHT SKID LOW.  THE RIGHT SKID BROKE 
AND THE HELICOPTER ROLLED ON ITS RIGHT SIDE AND CAME TO REST.  THE HELICOPTER 
WAS RECOVERED AND TAKEN TO THE OPERATOR'S FACILITY FOR EXAM.  THE FUEL SYS 
WAS CHECKED FOR CONTAMINANTS; NONE WERE FOUND.  FUEL QUANTITY WAS 
SUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN ENG OPERATION.  THE ENG WAS STARTED AND FOUND TO 
OPERATE NORMALLY.  NO DETERMINATION COULD BE MADE AS TO THE REASON 
FOR THE REPORTED LOSS OF ENG POWER. 
 IMPROPER COLLECTIVE AND CYCLIC CONTROL INPUT BY THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND 
DURING THE FORCED LANDING FOLLOWING TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DUE TO 
UNDETERMINED REASONS.
