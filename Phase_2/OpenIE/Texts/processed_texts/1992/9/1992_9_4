 THE PILOT COMPLETED A PREFLIGHT INSPECTION WHICH INCLUDED CHECKING  
FUEL SAMPLES FOR CONTAMINATES; NO CONTAMINATES WERE REPORTED. THE 
PILOT LOADED THE CHEMICALS ON THE AIRPLANE, FLEW 15 MINUTES TO THE 
SOYBEAN FIELD AND STARTED THE SPRAYING OPERATION. AFTER SPAYING ABOUT 
100 GALLONS, THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH TREES SURROUNDING THE FIELD. 
THE PILOT DID NOT RECALL THE EVENTS OF THE ACCIDENT, NOR WERE THERE 
WITNESSES TO THE ACCIDENT. HOWEVER, TWO PEOPLE NEAR THE ACCIDENT SITE, 
RECALLED DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF THE ENGINE OPERATION PRIOR TO THE 
COLLISION. AN EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF WATER 
IN THE FUEL MANIFOLD VALVE AND NUMBER 6 CYLINDER; IMPACT FORCES 
DAMAGED THE FUEL TANKS. THE ENGINE OPERATED NORMALLY DURING THE POST-
CRASH EXAMINATION. 
 AN INADEQUATE PREFLIGHT INSPECTION BY THE PILOT WHICH RESULTED IN FUEL 
CONTAMINATION AND A LOSS OF ENGINE POWER.
