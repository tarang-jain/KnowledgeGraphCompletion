THE PILOT LOADED THE 2 PASSENGERS AND GEAR IN THE AIRPLANE TO THE 
EXTENT THAT IT TOOK SUCCESSIVE ATTEMPTS TO CLOSE THE DOOR DUE TO THE 
GEAR WHICH 'FILLED UP THE AIRPLANE TO THE ROOF.' THE REAR PAX HAD TO LAY 
ON TOP OF MEAT AND CAMP SUPPLIES WITH 2 DOGS IN HIS LAP. THE AIRPLANE WAS 
ESTIMATED TO BE 772 LBS OVER MAX GROSS WEIGHT AT TAKEOFF. AFTER TAKEOFF 
THE AIRPLANE CLIMBED SLOWLY FOR APPROXIMATELY 55 MIN AT TAKEOFF POWER. A 
'SLEDGEHAMMER' SOUND PRECEDED THE APPEARANCE OF OIL FLOWING INTO THE 
CABIN AREA. NO REDUCTION OF POWER WAS OBSERVED. THE OIL PRESSURE BEGAN 
DROPPING RAPIDLY, AND THE PILOT MADE A PRECAUTIONARY LANDING ON A 
BEACH. THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER IN GRASS. ENGINE TEARDOWN EXAMINATION 
REVEALED THAT THE #6 CYLINDER HAD FAILED THROUGH THE HEAD-TO-BARREL 
THREADED JOINT. METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT THE FAILURE 
WAS THE RESULT OF FATIGUE CRACKING IN THE CYLINDER HEAD CASTING. THIS 
TYPE OF FAILURE OCCURS WHEN THE CYLINDER IS OPERATED AT ELEVATED 
TEMPERATURES (ABOVE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE) FOR A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF 
TIME. 
FATIGUE FAILURE OF AN ENGINE CYLINDER PRECIPITATED BY THE PILOT-IN-
COMMAND INTENTIONALLY EXCEEDING THE ENGINE PERFORMANCE RATINGS IN 
ORDER TO SUSTAIN FLIGHT IN THE GROSSLY OVERWEIGHT CONDITION. A FACTOR 
CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE HIGH GRASS. A FACTOR CONTRIBUTING 
TO THE SEVERITY OF THE PASSENGER'S INJURY WAS THE UNSECURED CARGO.
