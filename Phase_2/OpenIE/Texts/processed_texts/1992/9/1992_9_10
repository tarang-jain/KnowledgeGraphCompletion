 THE AG PILOT HAD BEEN SPRAYING COTTON FIELDS FOR ABOUT AN HOUR, AND 
WAS PERFORMING ANOTHER PASS. HE REPORTED 'ROLLING AND TURBULENT' 
WINDS NEAR THE TREE LINES. AS HE PULLED THE STICK AFT TO ARREST THE SINK 
RATE, THE AIRCRAFT CONTINUED TO DESCEND. THE LANDING GEAR BOGGED DOWN 
IN THE COTTON AND THE AIRCRAFT CONTACTED THE GROUND, RESULTING IN 
STRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO THE AIRFRAME. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT JUST PRIOR 
TO THE COLLISION, HE LOST ABOUT 20 KNOTS OF AIRSPEED DUE TO WIND SHEAR. 
 THE PILOT'S INADEQUATE COMPENSATION FOR EXISTING WIND CONDITIONS, 
WHICH RESULTED IN HIS INABILITY TO MAINTAIN A PROPER ALTITUDE. FACTORS 
WERE THE TURBULENCE AND WIND SHEAR PRESENT AT THE TIME OF THE 
ACCIDENT.
