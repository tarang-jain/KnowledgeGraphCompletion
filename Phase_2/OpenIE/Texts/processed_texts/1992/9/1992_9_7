 THE PRIVATE PILOT AND ONE PASSENGER DEPARTED ON A 2 HOUR FLIGHT WITH 
ABOUT 20 GALLONS OF FUEL IN EACH FUEL TANK. THE AIRPLANE WAS NOT FOUND 
UNTIL 2 DAYS LATER, BURNED IN A WOODED AREA. THE FUEL CONSUMPTION FOR 2 
HOURS WOULD BE ABOUT 19 GALLONS. THE FUEL SELECTOR WAS FOUND ON THE 
LEFT TANK AND THE LEFT WING EXHIBITED LESS FIRE DAMAGE THAN THE RIGHT 
WING. NO EVIDENCE OF POWERPLANT OR AIRFRAME PREEXISTING FAILURES WERE 
FOUND. 
 THE FAILURE OF THE PILOT IN COMMAND TO PLACE THE FUEL SELECTOR ON THE 
FULLEST TANK, RESULTING IN AN ENGINE FAILURE DUE TO FUEL STARVATION 
OVER UNSUITABLE TERRAIN.
