The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that as the tail came down during the 
landing roll in gusty wind conditions, a wind gust lifted the airplane about 10 feet into the air, 
with the left wing high. The pilot further reported that the airplane drifted off the runway to the 
right and impacted the ground right wing first.  
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, both wings, and the empennage.
According to the pilot there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. 
A review of recorded data from the automated weather observation station located about 5 
miles to the southeast, revealed that, about 7 minutes before the accident occurred, conditions 
were wind 300 degrees true at 13 knots, wind gust 18 knots.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll in gusty wind 
conditions, which resulted in runway excursion and impact with terrain.
