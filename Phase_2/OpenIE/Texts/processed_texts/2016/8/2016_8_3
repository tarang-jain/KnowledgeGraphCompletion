The private pilot was landing the airplane on runway 31 in visual meteorological conditions 
when witnesses observed the airplane in a nose-low, steep-left-bank attitude west of the 
runway over grassy terrain. A second later, the airplane impacted the terrain. An examination 
of the accident site revealed propeller slash marks about 1,800 ft from the approach end of 
runway 31. The initial point of a 200-foot-long debris path was located 385 ft from the slash 
marks on a 235Â° magnetic heading, and the airplane came to rest upright at the end of the 
debris path with its nose oriented northeast.
During the wreckage recovery, both main and the nose landing gear were found in a retracted 
position. During the postaccident examination, the throttle, mixture and propeller control 
levers were observed positioned full forward. The left and right main landing gear doors and 
the fuselage bottom skin exhibited numerous scratches and paint transfer consistent with the 
airplane's lower surface contacting the runway with the landing gear retracted. Both propeller 
blade tips were bent and curled aft, and the blades displayed numerous span-wise scratches 
from about mid span to the blade tips consistent with the propeller blades contacting the 
runway. The examination revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical failures or 
anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. 
It is likely that, during the landing sequence, the pilot realized that the landing gear was 
retracted and aborted the landing by adding full power. During the aborted landing, the pilot 
did not maintain control of the airplane, which rolled to the left and impacted terrain. 
The pilot's loss of control during an aborted landing. Contributing to the accident was the 
pilot's failure to extend the landing gear before touchdown.
