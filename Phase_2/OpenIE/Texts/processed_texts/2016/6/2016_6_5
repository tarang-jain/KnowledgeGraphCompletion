The flight instructor reported that during a helicopter "discovery flight" he was providing 
instruction to an airplane rated private pilot. The flight instructor further reported that prior to 
takeoff he told the pilot receiving instruction, "I am going to do the takeoff, and you can feel the 
controls." As soon as the helicopter entered a hover after takeoff, the pilot receiving instruction 
"put in strong left input" with the cyclic and would not stop after repeated instruction to let go 
of the flight controls. Subsequently, the helicopter's left main skid touched down and the 
helicopter rolled over and came to rest on its left side.
The tail boom was substantially damaged.
The flight instructor did not report any mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
The flight instructor reported on the National Transportation Safety Board Pilot/ Operator 
Aircraft Accident Report, within the owner/ operator safety recommendation section, he will 
not allow student pilots to touch the flight controls below 500 feet above the ground, until he is 
comfortable with the student.  
The pilot receiving instruction's incorrect action of interfering with the flight controls and 
failure to comply with the flight instructor's commands, which resulted in a loss of lateral bank 
control and a rollover.
