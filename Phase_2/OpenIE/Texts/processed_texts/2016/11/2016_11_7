The flight instructor in the multi-engine airplane reported that during a biennial flight review 
the pilot released the brakes and added full power for takeoff. The flight instructor further 
reported that during the takeoff roll he utilized the left engine mixture control to simulate a left 
engine failure, but the pilot "froze" at the flight controls and the airplane veered to the left. The 
flight instructor attempted to fail the right engine via the right mixture control in order to 
regain directional control, but his hand came off the mixture control and the airplane exited 
the runway. During the runway excursion, the flight instructor "finally got [his] hand back on 
the right mixture and pulled it to idle cut-off"; subsequently, the nose landing gear collapsed.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or 
malfunctions with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during a simulated left engine failure during 
takeoff. Also causal to the accident was the flight instructor's delayed remedial action to 
maintain directional control and reduce the right engine mixture control.
