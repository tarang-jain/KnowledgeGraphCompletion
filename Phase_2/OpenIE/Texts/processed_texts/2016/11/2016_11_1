According to the commercial pilot, the multiengine airplane was about 5 miles from the airport 
when it was cleared to land on runway 3R. Then, about 1.5 miles from the airport, he accepted 
a landing clearance change from the air traffic controller to land on runway 3L instead of 3R. 
The pilot increased engine power and set up to land on runway 3L; however, the airplane was 
"fast" on final approach and landed "long." The pilot "stood" on the brakes, the left tire "blew 
out," and the airplane veered off the left side of the runway. After departing runway 3L, the 
airplane traveled through the grass and impacted asphalt of another runway, which was raised 
about 7 inches above the ground. When the nose landing gear struck the asphalt, it collapsed, 
and the airplane then came to rest. During the accident sequence, the fuselage and wings were 
substantially damaged. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures 
with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. The wind at the airport around 
the time of the accident was from 140Â°at 7 knots.
The pilot's failure to maintain the proper airspeed during final approach and his subsequent 
loss of directional control during landing, which resulted in a runway excursion.
