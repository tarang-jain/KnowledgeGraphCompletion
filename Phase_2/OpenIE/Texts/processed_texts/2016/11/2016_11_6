The private pilot was departing on a local flight in the experimental airplane that he had built 
when the right gull-wing cabin door rotated open upon liftoff. A witness saw the pilot reaching 
for the fully open door as the airplane continued to overfly the runway at a low altitude. The 
airplane subsequently entered an aerodynamic stall at a low altitude and descended into 
terrain about 1,675 ft past the end of the runway and 183 ft left of the extended runway 
centerline. A postimpact fire destroyed the airframe.
The right gull-wing cabin door was found in a ravine about 600 ft from the main wreckage. 
Although the door had separated from the fuselage while the airplane was in flight, there was 
no evidence that the door had struck any portion of the airplane. The door latch handle and 
associated latch pins were found in a partially secured position. A functional test of the door 
latch mechanism did not reveal any anomalies. Testing of the door latch indicator system was 
not possible due to extensive postimpact fire damage to the fuselage and instrument panel. 
Based on the witness description and the physical evidence, it is likely that the pilot failed to 
ensure that the right gull-wing cabin door was properly latched before takeoff. The pilot likely 
became distracted by the open door and, as a result, did not maintain adequate airspeed after 
takeoff, which resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle of attack and experiencing an 
aerodynamic stall at a low altitude.
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed after becoming distracted by the opening of 
the gull-wing cabin door during takeoff, which resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical 
angle of attack and experiencing an aerodynamic stall at a low altitude. Contributing to the 
accident was the pilot's failure to ensure that the right gull-wing cabin door was properly 
latched before takeoff.
