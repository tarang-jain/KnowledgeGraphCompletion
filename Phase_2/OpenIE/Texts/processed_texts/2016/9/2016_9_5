The student pilot reported that during his first supervised solo landing that was conducted in 
light and variable crosswind conditions, he initiated a go around because, the wind had pushed 
him off course, and he was no longer in a good position to land. He further reported that 
during his second approach "everything looked good", but that immediately after the wheels 
touched down, the airplane veered to the left. He tried to compensate but "very quickly lost 
control". Subsequently, the airplane exited the runway to the left, the nose gear collapsed, and 
the right wing struck the ground.
A post-accident examination revealed substantial damage to the right wing rear spar.
The student pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions 
with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
A review of local weather at the time of the accident showed the wind 070 degrees true at 6 
nautical miles per hour, and not gusting. The student pilot landed on runway 28.
The student pilot's inadequate compensation for the quartering tailwind on landing, which 
resulted in a loss of directional control.
