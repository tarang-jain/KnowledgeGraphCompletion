The pilot was landing the helicopter on a nose-up slope when he "noticed the helicopter started 
to tilt aft." As the pilot "immediately" increased collective pitch and applied forward cyclic to 
abort the landing, three of the four main rotor blades struck the wire strike protection system 
on the cabin roof, which resulted in substantial damage to the blades. Representatives from the 
helicopter manufacturer examined the helicopter, replaced the three damaged rotor blades, 
and then returned the helicopter to service. According to the pilot, there were no mechanical 
deficiencies with the helicopter that would have prevented normal operation.
The pilot's overcontrolling of the helicopter during an aborted slope landing from a hover, 
which resulted in a main rotor blade strike.
