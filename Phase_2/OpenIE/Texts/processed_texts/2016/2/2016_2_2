A witness observed the sport pilot departing in his experimental, amateur-built gyroplane 
when, about 300 ft above ground level, the gyroplane turned right and the rotor blades began 
to slow. The gyroplane then made a sharp left turn, descended, and abruptly pitched up before 
impacting a field. A postaccident examination of the gyroplane found that the belt driving the 
prerotator had broken and had become entangled in the engine timing belt, which would have 
resulted in a loss of engine power. No other anomalies were detected with the airframe and 
engine. An autopsy did not reveal any medical concerns with the pilot.
 
The failure of the prerotator belt, which impeded the engine's timing belt and resulted in a loss 
of engine power at low altitude.
