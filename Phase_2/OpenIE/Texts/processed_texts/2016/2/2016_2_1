The flight instructor and a student pilot, who had flown about 5 flight hours with the 
instructor, were conducting an instructional flight in the light sport airplane. The student pilot 
reported that he was conducting the takeoff with the instructor assisting, and about 200 ft. 
above ground level, the airplane began to drift off the runway centerline. The student said that 
he attempted to correct, but it felt like the airplane was losing engine power and the nose was 
dropping. He added that he was pulling back on the controls and that the instructor was also 
pulling back, in an attempt to recover. A witness reported seeing the airplane climbing after 
takeoff in a nose high attitude when the left wing dropped, and the airplane entered a 
descending left turn. The airplane then impacted two parked airplanes on a ramp adjacent to a 
parallel taxiway. A postcrash fire consumed the majority of the airplane. Due to the fire 
damage, only a limited examination could be conducted; however, no preimpact abnormities 
were noted with the engine and airframe. The circumstances of the accident are consistent with 
a power-on departure stall.
The student pilot's loss of control after exceeding the airplane's critical angle-of-attack, which 
lead to a power-on, aerodynamic departure stall. Contributing to the accident was the flight 
instructor's inadequate oversight of the student pilot.
