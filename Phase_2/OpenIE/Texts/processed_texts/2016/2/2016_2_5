The owner of the airplane reported that the solo student pilot told him that the airplane 
"bounced upon touchdown." He further reported that the solo student pilot executed a "go-
around," and "determined the climb out rate was insufficient to clear the trees and the airspeed 
and altitude were insufficient to permit a safe course adjustment to avoid the tree line." The 
airplane touched down on a field with "plowed soft soil," the nose wheel collapsed, and the 
airplane nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing, the vertical 
stabilizer, and the rudder.
The owner did not report any preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe 
or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
The student pilot's failure to achieve an adequate climb rate while turning to avoid obstacles 
during an aborted landing, resulting in an uncontrolled descent, collision with terrain, and a 
nose over.
