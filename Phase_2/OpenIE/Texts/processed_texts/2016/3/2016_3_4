The student pilot and his flight instructor conducted 6 takeoffs and landings in the tailwheel-
equipped airplane. The student pilot then took off solo, flew in the traffic pattern, and during 
the landing he reported that as soon as my wheels hit the pavement it jerked hard to the right. 
The student pilot attempted to "straighten it out" but he reported that the airplane was going 
too fast so he applied power and attempted to take off. He then stated that the airplane 
"jumped me to the right of the runway," the airplane departed the runway to the right, the 
propeller impacted terrain, and the main landing gear collapsed under the fuselage. The 
airplane sustained substantial damage to the two right wing lift struts. 
The student pilot verified that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions 
with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
As a safety recommendation, the student pilot stated "more practice" and "land on gravel."
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing, which resulted in 
a runway excursion, and an impact with terrain.
