The pilot reported that, while on a cross-country flight, he diverted from his destination to a 
nearby airport due to low fuel. He added that the right fuel tank "went dry" and that the engine 
lost power on downwind, so he switched to the left fuel tank, and the engine momentarily 
restarted before it experienced a total power loss of power on base. Subsequently, the airplane 
impacted the instrument landing system lights, which resulted in substantial damage to both 
wings.
The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation. He reported that he miscalculated the fuel and "ran 
out of gas." A postaccident examination found about 1 cup of fuel in one of the tanks.
The pilot's improper preflight planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and the total loss of 
engine power.
