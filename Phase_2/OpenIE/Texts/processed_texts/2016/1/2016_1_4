According to the pilot, his intent was to perform a touch and go landing on a runway with 
patches of snow extending from the approach end to the departure end. The pilot reported that 
the touchdown and landing roll were uneventful. He reported that as he aborted the landing 
and configured the airplane for takeoff, he retracted the flaps, advanced the throttle and 
applied right rudder. He recalled that when he advanced the throttle, the airplane immediately 
made a sharp left turn, exited the runway to the left, and impacted the residual snow that was 
previously cleared from the runway. The airplane nosed over and the pilot exited the runway 
under his own power. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the vertical stabilizer and 
both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical failures or anomalies prior to or during the 
flight that would have prevented normal flight operation.
The pilot's failure to maintain airplane control during the takeoff, resulting in a runway 
excursion, and airplane nose over.
