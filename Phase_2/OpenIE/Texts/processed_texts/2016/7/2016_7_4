The pilot reported that during an "introductory flight" for two passengers, he departed the 
airport and flew into a canyon where the airplane encountered an "unforeseen immense 
downdraft". He further reported that he immediately initiated a right turn to exit the canyon 
but it became clear that a turn was not possible due to the mountainous terrain. Subsequently, 
the pilot decided to make an emergency landing on a mountain road. After touchdown the 
airplane skidded off the dirt road and down an embankment. A post-crash fire resulted in 
substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no pre impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
As a safety recommendation the pilot reported that he should have given himself more altitude 
before entering the canyon.
The pilot's decision to fly into a canyon without sufficient room to reverse course if necessary, 
which resulted in an emergency landing, loss of directional control, collision with terrain, and a 
post-crash fire.
