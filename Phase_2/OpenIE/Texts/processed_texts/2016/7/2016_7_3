The pilot reported that on final approach to runway 17, he was "distracted" by the runway 
composition and dimensions. The pilot reported that he identified the high tension power lines 
just before impact. He recalled that when he saw the power lines he "pulled up" in an attempt 
to climb, however it was too late, the propeller and engine cowl struck the power lines and the 
airplane slid down the power line wires toward the ground and came to rest in a corn field. The 
airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage aft of the cabin, and the empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical failures or anomalies with any portion of the 
airplane during the flight that would have prevented normal flight operations.
The Airport/Facility Directory states the dimensions and composition of the runway, displaced 
threshold and the high tension power lines as:
The first 630 feet of the runway is gravel and turf, and the width is 60 feet. The next 1300 feet 
of runway is a 14 foot wide section of concrete with 18 feet of turf on both sides of the concrete. 
The final 1120 feet of runway is a 12 to 25 foot wide section of gravel and asphalt chips, with 
12.5 to17.5 feet of turf on both sides of the gravel and asphalt chips. The displaced threshold is 
marked with 5 tires on each side of the runway. High tension power line wires are about 1200 
feet north of the runway threshold and do not have any safety markings. The power lines that 
the airplane struck intersect and cross the approach end of runway 17 at approximately 30 
degrees. Furthermore, the power lines are depicted on the FAA Aeronautical Chart for the 
airport.
The pilot's failure to see and avoid power lines on approach during landing, resulting a power 
line strike, uncontrolled descent, and collision with terrain. Contributing to the accident was 
the pilot's inadequate pre-flight planning.
