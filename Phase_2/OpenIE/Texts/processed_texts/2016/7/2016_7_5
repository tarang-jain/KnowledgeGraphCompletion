The helicopter flight instructor reported that the commercial pilot rated/helicopter flight 
instructor candidate receiving instruction was practicing autorotations with power recovery to 
the runway; during a practice 180 degree autorotation, the flight instructor candidate executed 
the landing flare too low to the ground resulting in a tail rotor strike. The flight instructor 
further reported that he took the controls and landed the helicopter after it had yawed, un-
commanded to the right, about 180 degrees.  
The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the vertical stabilizer and tail rotor drive 
assembly.
The flight instructor reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or 
malfunctions with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.  
The FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook FAA-H-8083-21A (2012) discusses procedures for 
autorotation and states in part:
Care must be taken in the execution of the flare so that the cyclic control is neither moved 
rearward so abruptly that it causes the helicopter to climb nor moved so slowly that it does not 
arrest the descent, which may allow the helicopter to settle so rapidly that the tail rotor strikes 
the groundâ€“ extreme caution should be used to avoid an excessive nose high and tail low 
attitude below 10 feet. The helicopter must be close to the landing attitude to keep the tail rotor 
from contacting the surface.
The helicopter flight instructor candidate's improper execution of the autorotation, resulting in 
abnormal ground contact and subsequent damage to the vertical stabilizer and tail rotor drive 
assembly.
