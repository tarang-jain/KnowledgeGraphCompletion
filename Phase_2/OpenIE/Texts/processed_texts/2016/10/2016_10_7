According to the pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane, during the approach, he applied 
carburetor heat, set airspeed to 70 knots, and set the flaps to 1 notch less than full. He reported 
that the flare and touchdown on the gravel runway was "very smooth." However, he recalled 
that, when the tailwheel contacted the ground, the right wing ascended, and the left wing 
dragged across the ground. The pilot reported that the left wing strut failed and that the 
airplane nosed over and came to rest on the gravel runway. Additionally, the pilot noted that, 
after the accident, the wind sock indicated a direct crosswind from the right and varied 
between three-quarters to completely full.
However, postaccident photographs of the airplane revealed that the airplane's left wing 
sustained damage to its top side. The bottom side of the left wing, the wing tip, and the wing 
strut revealed no indication of runway contact. The photographs revealed substantial damage 
to the horizontal stabilizer and the rudder.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's improper crosswind correction, which resulted in a loss of pitch control and nose-
over.
