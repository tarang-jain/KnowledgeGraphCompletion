The pilot reported that during his first approach to land he elected to go-around due to the crab 
angle and buffeting. On the second approach, he encountered downdrafts and moderate 
turbulence again on short final and applied power to go-around. During the go-around, the 
airplane continued to sink and impacted a cliff about 250 feet short of the runway threshold, 
and ultimately came to rest at the bottom of the cliff near a road. The fuselage and both wings 
sustained substantial damage.
According to the airport manager, when the airplane was on final approach he announced on 
the common traffic advisory frequency, "wind 250 at 11 and use caution for down drafts and 
turbulence on short final." The accident pilot acknowledged the transmission. The airport 
manager continued to observe the airplane and witnessed the pitch angle continuously increase 
on final approach, and then he heard the engine power increase. Subsequently, the airport 
manager witnessed the airplane "stall" and "fall from view."  
The pilot reported there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation. 
  
The pilot's exceedance of the critical angle of attack in turbulent and downdraft conditions, 
which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and collision with terrain on final approach.
