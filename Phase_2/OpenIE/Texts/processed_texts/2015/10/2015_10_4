The student pilot reported that on his first night training flight he was practicing takeoffs and 
landings. He stated that during his third approach, as he was turning from base to final, the 
precision approach path indicator (PAPI) displayed four red lights, indicating that he was 
below the recommended approach path. The flight instructor told him that he was too low and 
to add power. The student pilot added power and the far left PAPI light started to turn from red 
to white. He reported that on short final, he reduced engine power to idle and that during 
touchdown, the airplane collided with a runway threshold light. The airplane sustained 
substantial damage to horizontal stabilizer spar.
The flight instructor reported no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
The flight instructor's failure to correct the student pilot's approach path during the final 
approach, which resulted in a collision with runway threshold lights. Contributing to the 
accident was the student pilot's failure to attain and maintain the recommended approach 
path.
