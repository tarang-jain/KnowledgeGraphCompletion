During the enroute climb to cruise altitude, the low oil pressure warning light activated. The 
pilot notified air traffic control, received vectors to the nearest airport, and began a descent as 
the oil pressure continued to decrease. About 3 miles from the airport, the engine experienced 
a total loss of power. The pilot could not see the airport or runway due to a cloud layer below 
and elected to deploy the airplane parachute system. The airplane descended under canopy to a 
four-lane road, where a car impacted the left wing. A postaccident examination of the engine 
revealed a fatigue fracture of the oil cooler cross fitting, which resulted in oil starvation, 
internal damage to the crankcase, and a subsequent total loss of engine power.
About four months before the accident, the engine manufacturer released a critical service 
bulletin (CSB) for a known problem pertaining to the oil cooler cross fitting assembly. 
Although the airplane underwent scheduled maintenance about a month before the accident, 
the CSB was not completed due to time constraints. Although compliance was not mandatory, 
it is likely that the accident would have been prevented had the CSB been completed.
