According to the pilot, immediately after takeoff, the wind speed increased and he elected to 
complete one pattern and land. With a right quartering head wind, the pilot touched down yet 
reported that a wind gust made the airplane veer to the right side of the runway. He recalled 
that he applied full power and aborted the landing. The pilot reported that when he "looked out 
of the windshield", he realized the airplane was on a heading to impact the airfield hangars, so 
he turned the airplane to the left, the airplane stalled and impacted the ground. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage to the right wing strut and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical failures or anomalies prior to or during the 
flight that would have prevented normal flight operation.
The wind at the nearest weather reporting station reported wind from 210 degrees true at 7 
knots, with no gusts, and the departure runway heading was 14.
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack, resulting in an inadvertent 
aerodynamic stall and impact with terrain.
