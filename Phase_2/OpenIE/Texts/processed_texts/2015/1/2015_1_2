The pilot stated that he landed at a private airstrip earlier in the day and was departing with 
the intention of returning to his home airstrip. Prior to departure, he noted a left crosswind of 
about 15 mph. The initial phase of the takeoff was normal, and when becoming airborne, the 
wind lifted the left wing and the airplane drifted right over the adjacent field. The field was at a 
lower elevation, and with the loss of ground effect, the airplane sank resulting in the tail wheel 
colliding with the ground. Thereafter, the main landing gear impacted an irrigation pipe and 
the airplane flipped over inverted. During the accident sequence the airplane sustained 
substantial damage to both wings. 
The pilot further stated that the accident could have been prevented if they had waited for the 
wind to have subsided and/or performed the takeoff with the wing flaps extended. 
The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's failure to compensate for crosswind conditions during takeoff, which resulted in the 
loss of directional control and collision with terrain.
