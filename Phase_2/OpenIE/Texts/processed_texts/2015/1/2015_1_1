After landing, the pilot taxied to the fixed base operator to park. As he approached the parking 
ramp, a lineman stood in front of a tie-down spot and raised both hands in the air signaling to 
the pilot where to park. The spot was next to a parked jet. The pilot said that while taxing to the 
parking spot he was concentrating on staying clear of the jet and did not see a light pole located 
at the edge of the ramp. The right wing struck the pole resulting in structural damage to the 
wing.
The pilot's inadequate visual lookout while taxiing, which resulted in the airplane striking a 
pole.
