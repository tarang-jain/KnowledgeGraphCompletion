The pilots, who co-owned the airplane, departed for a personal flight and, after completing one 
circuit around the airport traffic pattern, were performing a low-altitude, high-speed pass over 
the runway. About halfway down the runway length, the airplane entered a barrel roll to the 
left and, after passing through 180 degrees of roll, began a descent that continued to ground 
contact. Postaccident examination of the flight controls revealed no evidence of preimpact 
failure or malfunction. Although the rear seat flight control stick was found separated and had 
not been properly secured in compliance with a service bulletin, it was damaged in a manner 
consistent with the impact and likely did not contribute to a loss of control. The pilots' decision 
to perform aerobatic maneuvers at low altitude significantly diminished their margin for error, 
and once the airplane began to descend while maneuvering, the pilots likely did not have 
adequate time to recover before impacting the ground.
