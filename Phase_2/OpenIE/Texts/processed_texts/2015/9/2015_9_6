During the cruise portion of a cross-country flight, about 20 minutes after takeoff, the 
commercial pilot stopped responding to air traffic controllers as the airplane reversed course. 
It then climbed from 6,500 ft to 9,000 ft mean sea level and completed two left circuits before 
descending rapidly into the ground. Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions. The pilot's autopsy revealed that he had severe coronary artery 
disease, scarring from previous heart attacks, and evidence of ongoing or recent damage to two 
new areas of heart muscle, indicating recent heart attacks. All of these conditions put him at 
risk of experiencing acute heart failure or a disturbance of heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Both 
acute heart failure and arrhythmia can rapidly lead to decreased consciousness due to low 
blood pressure. It is likely that acute symptoms from complications of the pilot's ongoing heart 
attacks resulted in impairment /incapacitation of the pilot and led to his loss of airplane 
control.
The pilot's incapacitation from complications of a recent heart attack, which resulted in a loss 
of control during cruise flight.
