The private pilot was conducting a personal cross-country flight. During cruise, the engine 
experienced a catastrophic failure and a total loss of power. The pilot performed a forced 
landing to an airport, landed long, and collided with an airport fence. Postaccident 
examination of the engine revealed internal damage consistent with the initial failure of the 
No. 1 piston and connecting rod assembly, most likely at the piston end, which caused a 
cascading failure of the adjacent piston and rod assemblies. Damage to the engine components 
precluded an accurate assessment of the specific initiating event, and evidence suggested that 
the engine contained oil at the time of the failure.
The engine had been involved in a propeller strike accident about 310 flight hours prior, which 
required an engine teardown, examination, and replacement of two connecting rods and one 
piston pin. Maintenance records did not disclose which rods were replaced. Following the 
repair, the engine went through a 10-year period of inactivity, during which time internal 
corrosion occurred. No precautionary steps were taken to monitor the effects of the corrosion, 
such as oil filter examination or oil analysis. The extent to which the corrosion contributed to 
the failure of the No. 1 piston and connecting rod assembly could not be determined.
A total loss of engine power during cruise flight due to a failure of the No. 1 piston and 
connecting rod assembly.
