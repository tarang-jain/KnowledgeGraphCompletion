The non-helicopter-rated pilot reported that while performing a bank, at low level, above a 
frozen river, he lost sight of the horizon and the helicopter impacted the frozen river. The 
helicopter came to rest on its left side, which resulted in substantial damage to the main rotor, 
tailboom, and cockpit structure. The non-helicopter-rated pilot further reported to a 
representative of the Federal Aviation Administration and Sheriff's Deputies that the helicopter 
was functioning "normally" at the time of impact and that "somehow I must have lost sight of 
the horizon in all the snow and ice." No preimpact malfunctions or abnormalities were noted 
with the helicopter that would have precluded normal operation.
The non-helicopter-rated pilot's improper decision to operate the helicopter at low-level and 
his inability to adequately see the horizon over snow and ice, which resulted in controlled flight 
into terrain.
