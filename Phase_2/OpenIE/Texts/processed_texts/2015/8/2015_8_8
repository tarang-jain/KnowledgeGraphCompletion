The pilot stated that the balloon flight was normal with light and variable wind conditions. The 
pilot stated she informed the passenger that the basket may "hop" a couple of times during the 
landing and told him to brace himself. When the balloon basket touched the ground, the pilot's 
foot became wedged between the sidewall of the basket and one of the fuel tanks. The pilot lost 
her balance, her body shifted, and she felt her ankle fracture. She told the passenger to 
continue pulling the deflation line. The envelope deflated quickly and the basket laid down 
onto its side. There was no damage to the envelope or basket. The pilot suffered a broken ankle 
and leg.
The pilot did not properly brace herself during the landing, which  resulted in a broken ankle 
and leg.
