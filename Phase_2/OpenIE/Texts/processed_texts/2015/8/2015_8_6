The noninstrument-rated commercial pilot departed for the cross-country flight over 
mountainous terrain in instrument meteorological conditions. A witness observed the airplane 
take off from runway 22, disappear into an overcast layer at 300 ft above ground level (about 
550 ft mean sea level [msl]), and then reappear heading in the opposite direction. The witness 
reported that the airplane departed the traffic pattern heading northeast. The wreckage was 
located in mountainous terrain at an elevation of 1,223 ft msl, 2.8 mi east of the departure 
airport. Meteorological data indicated that, at the time of the accident, a cloud layer extended 
over the accident site from about 550 ft msl to about 2,100 ft msl, and, at the elevation of the 
accident site, the terrain would have been obscured by clouds. Examination of the wreckage did 
not reveal evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have 
precluded normal operation of the airframe or engine. The orientation of the wreckage 
indicated that, at impact, the airplane was heading south and traveling at a ground speed 
consistent with normal traffic pattern speeds. The damage to the airplane was consistent with 
controlled flight into the terrain, and the airplane's impact heading was consistent with the 
pilot attempting to return to the airport when the airplane collided with the rising terrain.
The noninstrument-rated pilot's decision to conduct a visual flight in instrument 
meteorological conditions, which resulted in controlled flight into mountainous terrain.
