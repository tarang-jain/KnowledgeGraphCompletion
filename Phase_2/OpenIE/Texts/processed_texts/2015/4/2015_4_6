The pilot reported that he was landing his airplane at night and mistook the hangar lights for 
runway lights. The airplane struck trees on the final approach, then the ground before coming 
to rest, inverted. The pilot said that, in retrospect, he was on the incorrect radio frequency 
when he attempted to turn on the pilot-activated runway lights. A Federal Aviation 
Administration inspector examined the wreckage and reported that the airplane sustained 
substantial damage. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical problems with the 
airplane at the time of the accident. The runway lights operated normally after the accident.
The pilot's use of an incorrect radio frequency when attempting to turn on the runway lights, 
resulting is an attempt to land the airplane while aligned with airport hangar lights.
