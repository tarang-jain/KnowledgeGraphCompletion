The pilot reported that during a flight under night instrument flight rules, he exited instrument 
metrological conditions (IMC) "400 feet high and fast" during the instrument approach. The 
pilot continued the landing and reported that he touched down more than half way down the 
wet runway, and then decided to abort the landing. Instead of performing the published missed 
approach procedure, the pilot turned left and entered the traffic pattern. 
During the left base, the pilot reported that he reentered IMC, heard the stall warning horn, 
and felt buffeting. During the inadvertent aerodynamic stall, the pilot added power but 
continued the descent to land. The pilot reported that he regained visual reference to the 
runway lights on final approach and realized he was too low. As he attempted to add full power 
to go-around, the airplane impacted terrain about 1,300 feet west of the runway in a left wing 
down attitude. The vertical stabilizer, fuselage, and both wings sustained substantial damage. 
The pilot reported there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's decision to fly a traffic pattern following an aborted instrument landing in night 
instrument metrological conditions, which resulted in a loss of visual reference to the runway, 
an inadvertent aerodynamic stall, and a collision with terrain.
