The pilot reported that during the landing roll on a rough grass private strip, the airplane 
impacted a "little bump" and became airborne. He reported that he elected to abort the landing 
due to the end of the runway and trees that were "coming up pretty fast". 
The pilot further reported that he knew the airplane would not be able to climb and turn at the 
same time due to the low airspeed. He elected to turn right, and subsequently impacted a fence 
post with the right wing strut. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings, and 
the fuselage. 
According to the pilot there were no pre-impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's decision to continue the unstabilized approach and landing and his delayed decision 
to go around with an insufficient climb rate, which resulted with collision with trees.
