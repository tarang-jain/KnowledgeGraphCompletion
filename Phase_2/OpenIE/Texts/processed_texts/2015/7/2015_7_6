The pilot reported that after he dropped his passenger off on a road, he departed to the east in 
smoky and hazy conditions. Shortly after takeoff, the helicopter impacted power transmission 
line wires that ran across the road. The helicopter then impacted the ground and skidded to a 
stop.  
The pilot reported there were no pre-impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. The helicopter sustained 
substantial damage to the main rotors, upper arm, and fork assembly.
The pilot's failure to monitor the flight environment for adequate terrain/obstacle clearance 
during takeoff, which resulted in the inflight collision with power transmission line wires.
