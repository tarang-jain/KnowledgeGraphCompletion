The commercial pilot was conducting a cross-country personal flight and reported that the 
airplane was on the final approach leg of the traffic pattern when it impacted terrain short of 
the runway. The pilot stated that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation; however, he could not recall what 
occurred just before or during the accident sequence. The pilot-rated passenger noted that the 
airplane was low during the final approach and that he put his hand on the pilot's hand to add 
power but that the airplane impacted the ground about that time. 
Although the pilot indicated that he believed that the airplane might have descended due to a 
microburst, he noted that it was not raining at the time of the accident. Further, there was no 
evidence of any microburst activity within 10 miles of the accident site about the time of the 
accident and no indications of any outflow boundary or gust front.
An airplane performance study using GPS and reported wind data revealed that the pilot was 
slowing the airplane while on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern, and that, while turning 
onto the final approach leg of the traffic pattern, he continued slowing it while turning onto the 
base and final legs of the traffic pattern. While on the final approach leg of the traffic pattern, 
he allowed the airplane to slow to near the stall speed. It is likely that the airplane exceeded its 
critical angle-of-attack during the turn at low airspeed, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall 
and the airplane's subsequent impact with terrain short of the runway.
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed while turning onto the final approach leg of 
the traffic pattern, which led to the airplane exceeding its critical angle-of-attack and 
experiencing an aerodynamic stall.
