The pilots of the two balloons involved in a midair collision reported that they both began the 
takeoff ascent as part of a competition. The Balloon Works balloon pilot, who was lower than 
the Balony balloon during the ascent, reported that his envelope collided vertically with the 
basket of the Balony balloon, about 2,000 feet above the ground. The Balony balloon pilot 
reported that he saw the Balloon Works balloon below him and started to use both of the 
available burners, but was unable to climb fast enough. A witness to the accident reported that 
the Balony balloon pilot did not use the balloon's burners until after the collision. After the 
midair collision, the Balloon Works balloon began to descend about 700 feet per minute and 
impacted the ground. The pilot of the Balony Balloon reported that he landed without further 
incident.
Both of the pilots reported there were no pre-impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with 
their balloons or burners that would have precluded normal operation. 
A postaccident inspection of the Balony balloon revealed no damage to the balloon or the 
burner. A postaccident inspection of the Balloon Works balloon revealed substantial damage to 
the envelope.
