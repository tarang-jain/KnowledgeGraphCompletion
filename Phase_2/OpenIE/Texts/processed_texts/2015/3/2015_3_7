During an instructional flight in a tailwheel equipped airplane, the student pilot and flight 
instructor planned to stay in the traffic pattern for touch and go landing practice. During the 
landing rollout, the airplane started drifting to the left side of the runway. Subsequently, the 
student pilot applied a hard correction to the right with the rudder pedals and the airplane 
ground looped, stopping 180 degrees from the landing direction. The flight instructor stated 
that he called for "my aircraft" when the student pilot made the hard correction, but the 
student pilot did not get off rudder pedals. Both the student pilot and flight instructor 
suspected that inadvertent brake application may have been applied in the heel brake equipped 
airplane. The flight instructor added that he did not observe any preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions with the airplane and the winds were light during the time of the accident. 
Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed 
substantial damage to the left wing.
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control while landing and the flight 
instructor's delayed remedial action, which resulted in a ground-loop and the left wing 
dragging the runway.
