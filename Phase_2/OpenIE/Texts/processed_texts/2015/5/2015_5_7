The pilot, who was in the rear tandem seat of the tailwheel airplane, had just landed and was 
taxing to the fuel pumps to refuel. He did not see the parked Beech A36 over the nose of his 
airplane and collided with the right wing of N4678A. The pilot said the accident could have 
been prevented if he had followed the taxi line on the tarmac. He also blamed his "less than 
effective brakes" that didn't help as he tried to control the airplane in the wind. This caused his 
attention to be diverted and he lost sight of the surrounding obstructions. The pilot had logged 
a total of 82 flight hours, of which 13 hours were in the accident airplane.
The pilot's loss of positional awareness while taxiing, resulting in a collision with a parked and 
unoccupied airplane. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's difficulty seeing over the nose 
of the airplane, his preoccupation with trying to control the airplane in the wind, and his 
minimal experience in the airplane.
