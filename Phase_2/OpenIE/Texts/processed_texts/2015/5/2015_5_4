While maneuvering in mountainous terrain about 700 feet above ground level, the airplane 
encountered "an extreme clear-air [sic] microburst." The pilot was unable to control the 
descent rate and executed an off-airport landing. During the landing, the nose gear collapsed 
and the airplane nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the vertical 
stabilizer and both wings. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of 
mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.
The inadvertent encounter with a microburst while maneuvering near mountainous terrain, 
which resulted in a off airport landing and impact with terrain.
