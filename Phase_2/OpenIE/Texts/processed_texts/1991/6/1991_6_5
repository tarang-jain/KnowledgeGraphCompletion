 THE AIRPLANE MADE ONE PASS OVER THE PRIVATE STRIP WHERE IT WAS TO LAND 
AND THEN ENTERED WHAT WITNESSES DESCRIBED AS A MODIFIED LEFT TRAFFIC 
PATTERN. ON EXTENDED BASE, ABOUT 1.5 MILES FROM THE RUNWAY THRESHOLD, 
THE AIRPLANE STRUCK HIGH TENSION LINES AT ABOUT 100 FEET AGL. AT THE TIME 
OF THE WIRE STRIKE, THE PILOT WAS FLYING DOWN A RIVER. THE AIRPLANE 
SUBSEQUENTLY IMPACTED THE GROUND VERTICALLY AND AN INTENSE POST-
CRASH FIRE ERUPTED SHORTLY AFTER IMPACT.  THERE WERE FOUR AIRPORTS 
WITHIN A FIVE MILE RADIUS OF THE POWER LINE, AND THE LINES WERE NOT 
MARKED. THE PILOT WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE LOCAL AREA AND THE LANDING 
STRIP. 
 THE PILOT'S IMPROPER VISUAL APPROACH, AND HIS FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AN 
ADEQUATE VISUAL LOOKOUT FOR OBSTRUCTIONS. FACTORS WERE THE UNMARKED 
POWER LINES
