 THE PILOT WAS ATTEMPTING TO DEPART THE 1300 FOOT RUNWAY AND THE 
ENGINE WAS NOT DEVELOPING FULL POWER.  THE PILOT INADVERTENTLY LEFT 
THE CARB HEAT ON. WHEN THE AIRPLANE WAS ABOUT 100 YARDS FROM THE END 
OF THE RUNWAY THE PILOT ABRUPTLY PULLED THE CONTROL STICK EFFECTING A 
LIFT-OFF IN GROUND EFFECT. WHEN THE AIRPLANE ATTAINED AN ALTITUDE ABOVE 
GROUND EFFECT IT STALLED AND SETTLED INTO THE TREES AND INJURED AN 
INDIVIDUAL ON THE GROUND AS THE AIRCRAFT PASSED OVER HIM. 
 THAT THE PILOT'S PREFLIGHT WAS IMPROPER; THAT HE DEPARTED WITH THE 
CARBURETOR HEAT ON; FAILED TO ABORT WHEN IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE 
AIRPLANE WAS NOT GOING TO TAKE OFF; AND ABRUPTLY LIFTING THE AIRPLANE SO 
THAT IT BECAME AIRBORNE IN GROUND EFFECT, BUT THEN STALLED AND SETTLED 
INTO THE TREES.
