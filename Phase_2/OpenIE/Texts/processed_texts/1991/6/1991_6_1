 THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH FARM EQUIPMENT DURING A GROUND 
RUN FOR TAKEOFF.  THE PILOT CONTINUED THE TAKEOFF AFTER LOSING 
DIRECTIONAL CONTROL.  A PILOT RATED PASSENGER ASSUMED CONTROL OF THE 
AIRPLANE JUST BEFORE IMPACT AND UNSUCCESSFULLY ATTEMPTED TO HOP THE 
AIRPLANE OVER THE EQUIPMENT. 
 THE FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO ABORT THE TAKEOFF AND IMPROPER REMEDIAL 
ACTION BY THE PILOT RATED PASSENGER AFTER ASSUMING CONTROL OF THE 
AIRPLANE.  A FACTOR ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCIDENT IS THE PILOT LOSING 
DIRECTIONAL CONTROL DURING THE TAKEOFF GROUND RUN.
