TEMPERATURE AND THEN DEPARTED ON AN IFR FLIGHT IN FREEZING RAIN AND 
SNOW WITH A TEMPERATURE/DEW POINT OF 33/31. DEPARTURE INSTRUCTIONS 
WERE FOR A RIGHT TURN TO THE NORTH FOLLOWING TAKEOFF AND DIRECT TO 
THE VOR. THE AIRCRAFT WAS FOUND NINE HOURS AFTER DEPARTING, SCATTERED 
IN A FIELD, 1.5 MILES NORTH OF THE AIRPORT. 
THE PILOT'S DECISION TO INITIATE FLIGHT INTO FREEZING RAIN WHICH RESULTED 
IN STRUCTURAL ICING THAT EXCEEDED THE ABILITY OF THE AIRCRAFT TO 
MAINTAIN FLIGHT. A FACTOR WAS: IMPROPER DEICING.
