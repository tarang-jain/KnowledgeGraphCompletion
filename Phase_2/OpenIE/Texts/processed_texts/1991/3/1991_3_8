 THE FUEL TANKS WERE TOPPED OFF AND THE AIRCRAFT WAS FLOWN FOR .5 HOUR BEFORE 
THE ACCIDENT PILOT RENTED THE AIRCRAFT. NO FURTHER SERVICING WAS PERFORMED.  
THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT DEPARTED WITH LESS-THAN-FULL TANKS AND WHILE RETURNING 
TO LAND FOLLOWING AN APPROXIMATELY 3-HR FLIGHT, THE ENG QUIT DUE TO FUEL EXHAUSTION.  
THE PILOT STARTED IT MOMENTARILY BUT IT QUIT AGAIN.  DURING THE LANDING 
ROLL FOLLOWING THE FORCED LANDING, THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH A PALM TREE.  
THE FUEL TANKS WERE DRAINED WHICH REVEALED THAT THEY CONTAINED 1.5 
GALS.  THE OWNER'S MANUAL STATES THAT THE UNUSABLE FUEL QUANTITY FOR 
BOTH FUEL TANKS IS 1.5 GALS.  REVIEW OF AIRCRAFT RECORDS REVEALED THAT THE 
AIRCRAFT WAS OPERATED FOR 3.8 HRS SINCE LAST REFUELING. 
 IMPROPER IN-FLIGHT PLANNING DECISION BY THE PILOT RESULTING IN THE 
TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DUE TO FUEL EXHAUSTION. CONTRIBUTING TO THE 
ACCIDENT WERE THE UNRELIABLE FUEL QUANTITY INDICATORS.
