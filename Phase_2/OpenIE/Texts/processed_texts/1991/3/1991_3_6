THE DUAL STUDENT, WHO HAD 2.4 HOURS CONVENTIONAL GEAR TIME, WAS RIDING 
THE BRAKES WHEN THE AIRPLANE TOUCHED DOWN DURING PRACTICE CROSS 
WIND TOUCH AND GO LANDINGS. THE AIRPLANE COCKED INTO THE WIND AND 
DEPARTED THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY. THE INSTRUCTOR REGAINED CONTROL 
OF THE AIRPLANE, STRAIGHTENED IT OUT, AND ATTEMPTED TO ABORT THE 
LANDING. THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH A WATER FILLED DITCH AND NOSED 
OVER PRIOR TO GETTING AIRBORNE. THE STUDENT AND THE INSTRUCTOR BOTH 
FELT THE STUDENT WAS RIDING THE BRAKES DURING THE ATTEMPTED ABORT. THE 
LANDING WAS MADE WITH A 70 DEGREE LEFT CROSS WIND, REPORTEDLY BLOWING 
AT 8 KNOTS, GUSTING TO 12 KNOTS. 
THE DUEL STUDENT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL DURING THE 
LANDING AND HIS INADVERTENT ACTIVATION OF THE BRAKES. A FACTOR WAS THE 
DITCH.
