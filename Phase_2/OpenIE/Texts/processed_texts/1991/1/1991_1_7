 SHORTLY AFTER DEPARTING RUNWAY 28 AT PRINCETON AIRPORT, AT ABOUT 800 
FEET, THE AIRPLANE ENGINE SUDDENLY LOST POWER. THE PILOT SAID THAT HE 
MADE A RIGHT TURN AND ATTEMPTED A LANDING IN A CLEARED FIELD ADJACENT 
TO THE DEPARTURE END OF RUNWAY 28.  AS HE APPROACHED GROUND LEVEL, HE 
BANKED LEFT TO AVOID A LARGE TREE IN FRONT OF THE RIGHT WING.  THE LEFT 
WING TIP, LEFT MAIN GEAR, AND NOSE OF THE AIRPLANE HIT THE GROUND.  
ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS WERE CONDUCIVE TO CARBURETOR ICE.  THE FAA 
INSPECTORS REPORTED THE AIRPLANE ENGINE WAS REMOVED FROM THE 
AIRPLANE PRIOR TO THEIR ARRIVAL AT THE ACCIDENT SITE. 
PILOT FACTOR IN THAT THE PILOT FAILED TO USE CARBURETOR HEAT RESULTING 
IN ENGINE POWER LOSS DUE TO CARBURETOR ICE. FACTORS WERE UNSUITABLE 
TERRAIN AND OBSTRUCTIONS.
