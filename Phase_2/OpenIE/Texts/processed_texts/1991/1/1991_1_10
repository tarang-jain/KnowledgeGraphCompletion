 ON FINAL APPROACH FOR LANDING, THE AIRCRAFT WINDSHIELD FOGGED UP.  THE 
PILOT STATED THAT HE THOUGHT HE WAS LOW CROSSING THE RUNWAY 
THRESHOLD SO HE PULLED THE AIRCRAFT UP.  WHEN HE FLARED FOR LANDING, 
THE AIRCRAFT WAS HIGH AND MADE A HARD LANDING.  THE AIRCRAFT BOUNCED 
ONCE AND SLID OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY AFTER THE SECOND 
TOUCHDOWN.  THE LEFT MAIN LANDING GEAR COLLAPSED WHEN THE AIRCRAFT 
DEPARTED THE RUNWAY.  THERE WAS SLUSH ON THE RUNWAY. 
 FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL DURING THE 
LANDING ROLL.  FACTORS RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT ARE A FOGGY WINDSHIELD, 
MISJUDGEMENT OF ALTITUDE, PREMATURE LANDING FLARE, AND SLUSH ON THE 
RUNWAY.
