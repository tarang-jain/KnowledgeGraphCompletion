 THE PILOT STATED IN HIS WRITTEN REPORT THAT HE REFUELED THE AIRCRAFT 
PRIOR TO DEPARTURE WITH ABOUT 19 GALLONS OF AVIATION FUEL.  ACCORDING TO 
THE PILOT, HE DEPARTED COLUMBIA AND CLIMBED TO ABOUT 10,000 FEET WHILE 
HE FLEW AROUND THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS.  AT ABOUT 1200 HOURS, HE 
TURNED AND HEADED BACK TO COLUMBIA.  HE REPORTED THAT THE ENGINE 
BEGAN TO SURGE AND THE REAR CYLINDER EGT INDICATED A POTENTIAL FUEL 
STARVATION PROBLEM.  THE ENGINE WAS NOT PRODUCING SUFFICIENT POWER TO 
MAINTAIN FLIGHT AND THE PILOT SET UP FOR A FORCED LANDING IN A MOUNTAIN 
MEADOW. HE STATED THAT THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO SURGE, EVEN AFTER THE 
THROTTLE WAS REDUCED TO IDLE, WHICH CAUSED THE AIRCRAFT TO OVER SHOOT 
HIS INTENDED LANDING SPOT.  THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH TREES AT THE FAR 
END OF THE MEADOW.  THE PILOT SAID THE  AIRCRAFT IS NOT EQUIPPED WITH AN 
ELECTRIC BOOST PUMP.  HE SPECULATED THAT THE ENGINE POWER PROBLEM WAS 
DUE TO EITHER VAPOR LOCK OR A MALFUNCTION OF THE ENGINE DRIVEN PUMP. 
 FUEL STARVATION DUE TO VAPOR LOCK.
