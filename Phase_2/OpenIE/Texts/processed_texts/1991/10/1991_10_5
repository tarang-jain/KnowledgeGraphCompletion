 DURING CRUISE FLIGHT, THE LEFT ENGINE LOST POWER AND OIL PRESSURE. AN 
ENGINE TEARDOWN ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE CRANKSHAFT 
COUNTERWEIGHTS HAD TWO INCORRECT OF THE FOUR INSTALLED ROLLERS.  ALL 
FOUR ROLLERS WERE PART NO. 73648. ACCORDING TO TEXTRON LYCOMING, THE 
CORRECT ROLLER CONFIGURATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN 'TWO PART NO. 73648 5.1 
ORDER AND TWO PART NO. 76788 6.3 ORDER ROLLERS.'  AS CONFIGURED, THE 
ENGINE WOULD EXPERIENCE UNACCEPTABLE 6TH ORDER TORSIONAL VIBRATIONS. 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
 INCORRECT INSTALLATION OF CRANKSHAFT COUNTERWWEIGHT ROLLERS BY THE 
MANUFACTURER DURING REMANUFACTURE OF THE ENGINE. FACTOR WAS THE 
INADEQUATE SURVEILLANCE OF THE ENGINE ASSEMBLY PROCESS BY THE 
MANUFACTURER.
