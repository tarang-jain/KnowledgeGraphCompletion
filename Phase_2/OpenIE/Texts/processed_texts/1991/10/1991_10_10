 THE PILOT STATED THAT AFTER LANDING, HE LOST CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT.  
HE APPLIED FULL POWER IN AN ATTEMPT TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE 
ON THE GROUND, BUT THE AIRPLANE BECAME AIRBORNE INSTEAD.  HE REALIZED 
THAT HE COULD NOT CLEAR OBSTACLES IN HIS FLIGHT PATH AND ELECTED TO 
LAND THE AIRCRAFT IN THE ROUGH TERRAIN ON THE SIDE OF THE RUNWAY.  THE 
AIRCRAFT RECEIVED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE, HOWEVER, NEITHER THE PILOT NOR 
HIS PASSENGER WERE INJURED. 
 THE FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT DURING THE 
LANDING ROLL AND THE IMPROPER REMEDIAL ACTION TAKEN BY THE PILOT TO 
REGAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE.
