THE PILOT SAID THAT DURING A CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHT, THE AIRCRAFT 
ENCOUNTERED AIRFRAME ICING.  HE DIVERTED TO CARTHAGE, MO. HE SAID THAT 
AFTER TOUCHDOWN ON AN ICE COVERED RUNWAY, HE WAS UNABLE TO STOP THE 
AIRCRAFT AND IT SLID OFF THE END OF THE RUNWAY AND INTO A CHAIN LINK FENCE.  
BEFORE THE FLIGHT, THE PILOT HAD BEEN ADVISED OF ICING CONDITIONS IN THE 
AREA. 
CONTINUED FLIGHT BY THE PILOT INTO KNOWN ICING CONDITIONS, AND HIS 
IMPROPER PLANNING/DECISION, WHICH RESULTED IN AN OVERRUN OF THE 
RUNWAY AFTER HE DIVERTED TO AN ALTERNATE AIRPORT.  THE ADVERSE 
WEATHER CONDITION, ICY RUNWAY, AND CHAIN LINK FENCE NEAR THE END OF 
THE RUNWAY WERE RELATED FACTORS.
