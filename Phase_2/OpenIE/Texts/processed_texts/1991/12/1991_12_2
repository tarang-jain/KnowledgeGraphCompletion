THE PILOTS DEPARTED WITH FULL FUEL TANKS FOR THEIR FIVE HOUR FLIGHT.  
THEY WERE GIVEN SEVERAL ALTITUDE CHANGES WHICH AT TIMES, PUT THEM INTO 
GREATER THAN EXPECTED HEAD WINDS.  THEY ALSO WERE GIVEN ONE 
SIGNIFICANT OFF COURSE VECTOR.  LATER IN THE FLIGHT, THEY ELECTED TO STOP 
SHORT OF THEIR DESTINATION FOR FUEL. DURING THEIR ILS APPROACH IN IMC 
CONDITIONS. THE AIRCRAFT RAN OUT OF FUEL AND THEY CRASHED INTO A 
PARTIALLY WOODED AREA. 
THE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DUE TO FUEL EXHAUSTION AND THE PILOTS 
SELECTION OF UNSUITABLE TERRAIN FOR THE FORCE LANDING. A FACTOR WAS THE 
PILOT'S IMPROPER INFLIGHT DECISION.
