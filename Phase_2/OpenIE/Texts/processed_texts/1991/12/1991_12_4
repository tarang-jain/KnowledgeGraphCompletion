 THE PILOT OF A HIGH WING, SINGLE ENGINE AIRPLANE WAS FLYING A PUBLISHED 
ILS APPROACH AS GUIDANCE TO A RUNWAY HE INTENDED TO LAND ON.  THE PILOT 
STATED THAT HE ANNOUNCED HIS POSITION THREE TIMES DURING THE 
APPROACH. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE HEARD THE PILOT OF ANOTHER AIRPLANE 
ANNOUNCE HIS POSITION ON BASE LEG FOR THE SAME RUNWAY HE WAS 
INTENDING TO LAND ON.  HE STATED THAT HE COULD NOT SEE THE OTHER 
AIRPLANE AND DID NOT ASK THE PILOT OF THAT AIRPLANE TO RE-STATE HIS 
POSITION.  HE CONTINUED INBOUND AND, DURING THE FLARE FOR LANDING, A 
LOW WING AIRPLANE LANDED ON TOP OF HIS AIRPLANE. AN ON-SCENE 
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT BOTH AIRPLANES WERE WHITE IN OVERALL 
COLOR WITH DARK TRIM.  THE TERRAIN BOTH AIRPLANES WERE OPERATING OVER 
WAS SNOW COVERED. 
 THE FAILURE OF BOTH PILOTS TO MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION FROM EACH 
OTHER. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THIS ACCIDENT WERE AN INADEQUATE VISUAL 
LOOKOUT BY BOTH PILOTS AND THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S FAILURE TO FOLLOW 
PROCEDURES AND DIRECTIVES.
