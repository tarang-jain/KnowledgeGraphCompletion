 THE PILOT OF A LOW WING, SINGLE ENGINE, AIRPLANE WAS TAKING A FLIGHT TEST 
FOR A COMMERCIAL PILOT CERTIFICATE.  THE PILOT STATED HE ANNOUNCED HIS 
POSITION ON EACH LEG OF THE TRAFFIC PATTERN; THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY THE 
PILOT EXAMINER. DURING THE FLARE FOR LANDING THE AIRPLANE LANDED ON 
TOP OF A HIGH WING, SINGLE ENGINE, AIRPLANE.  BOTH OCCUPANTS OF THE LOW 
WING AIRPLANE STATED THAT THEY DID NOT SEE OR HEAR RADIO CALLS FROM THE 
HIGH WING AIRPLANE.  THE ON SCENE INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT BOTH 
AIRPLANES WERE WHITE IN OVERALL COLOR WITH DARK TRIM.  THE TERRAIN 
THEY WERE OPERATING OVER WAS SOW COVERED.  THE HIGH WING AIRPLANE TO 
THE RUNWAY THE LOW WING AIRPLANE WAS INTENDING TO LAND ON. 
 THE FACT THAT BOTH PILOTS DID NOT MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION FROM EACH 
OTHER.  CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THIS ACCIDENT WERE AN INADEQUATE 
VISUAL LOOKOUT FOR BOTH PILOTS AND THE PILOT IN COMMAND OF THE OTHER 
AIRPLANE WAS NOT FOLLOWING PROCEDURES AND DIRECTIVES.
