 RETURNING TO THE PILOT'S HOME BASE AIRPORT, THE PILOT INDICATED THAT HE 
OVERFLEW THE UNCONTROLLED FIELD AND THEN ENTERED THE TRAFFIC PATTERN 
FOR RUNWAY 26 WHICH WAS OVER 4400 FEET LONG.  THE PILOT REPORTED THAT 
HE OBSERVED THE WIND SOCK WAS PARALLEL TO THE RUNWAY BUT FAILED TO 
INITIALLY OBSERVE THAT HE WAS LANDING WITH A NEARLY DIRECT 20 TO 25 KNOT 
TAILWIND. THE AIRPLANE TOUCHED DOWN LONG, OVERRAN THE RUNWAY'S 
DEPARTURE END, COLLIDED WITH A POLE AND CAUGHT ON FIRE. 
 THE PILOT'S SELECTION OF THE WRONG LANDING RUNWAY AND HIS FAILURE TO 
ATTAIN THE PROPER TOUCHDOWN LOCATION.  FACTORS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO 
THE ACCIDENT WERE RELATED TO THE PILOT'S INADEQUATE OBSERVATIONS OF 
THE WEATHER AND THE TAILWIND CONDITION WHICH EXISTED.
