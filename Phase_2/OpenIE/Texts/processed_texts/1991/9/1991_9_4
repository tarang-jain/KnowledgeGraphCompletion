 THE STUDENT PILOT LANDED HARD AND BOUNCED THE AIRPLANE BACK INTO THE 
AIR ABOUT 20 FEET.  THE INSTRUCTOR TOOK OVER THE CONTROLS BUT WAS 
UNABLE TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE BEFORE IT STALLED AND STRUCK THE 
RUNWAY WITH THE LEFT WING AND TAIL.  THE AIRPLANE THEN DEPARTED THE 
LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY, STRIKING A RUNWAY LIGHT.  THERE WERE NO 
MECHANICAL FAILURES OR MALFUNCTIONS WITH THE AIRPLANE BEFORE THE 
ACCIDENT. 
 IMPROPER RECOVERY FROM A BOUNCED LANDING BY THE STUDENT PILOT AND 
THE DELAYED REMEDIAL ACTION OF THE INSTRUCTOR PILOT.  CONTRIBUTING TO 
THIS ACCIDENT WAS THE STUDENT PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THE PROPER 
DESCENT RATE WHICH RESULTED IN A BOUNCED LANDING AND THE CERTIFIED 
INSTRUCTOR PILOT'S INADEQUATE SUPERVISION DURING THE LANDING.
