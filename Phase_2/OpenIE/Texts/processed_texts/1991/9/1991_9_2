 THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH TREES AND TERRAIN WHILE 
ATTEMPTING TO CLIMB FROM TAKEOFF WITH A SAILPLANE IN TOW. THE SAILPLANE 
RELEASED FROM THE TOW PLANE AND RETURNED TO THE DEPARTURE AIRPORT.  
ACCORDING TO THE PILOT THE AIRPLANE ENCOUNTERED LIGHT TO MODERATE 
TURBULENCE DURING INITIAL CLIMB AND THE AIRPLANE SANK INTO TREES ONE 
MILE NORTH OF THE AIRPORT.  IN AN INTERVIEW AFTER THE ACCIDENT THE PILOT 
DID NOT REMEMBER DOING A WEIGHT AND BALANCE CALCULATION BEFORE 
TAKEOFF.  WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT STALL RECOGNITION AND RECOVERY THE 
PILOT STATED THAT THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE WAS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER 
AIRCRAFT IN THAT YOU ONLY HAD TO HOLD THE NOSE UP AND THE AIRPLANE 
WOULD FLY ITSELF OUT.  THE DENSITY ALTITUDE AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT 
WAS 2500 FEET.  THE AIRPLANE WAS ESTIMATED TO BE AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE 
ALLOWABLE GROSS WEIGHT AT TAKEOFF. 
 INADEQUATE PREFLIGHT PLANNING AND PREPARATION AND AIRPLANE 
PERFORMANCE DATA NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THE PILOT.  FACTORS ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE ACCIDENT ARE THE PILOT'S LACK OF TOTAL EXPERIENCE IN TYPE OF 
OPERATION, DELAYED REMEDIAL ACTION, AND THE OPERATOR'S INSUFFICIENT 
STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
