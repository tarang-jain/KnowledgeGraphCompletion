THE STUDENT PILOT AND INSTRUCTOR WERE ON THEIR FIRST DUAL FLIGHT. THE 
STUDENT WAS ON THE FLIGHT CONTROLS WHEN THE HELICOPTER DRIFTED RIGHT 
AND THE RIGHT SKID CAUGHT THE GROUND.  THE HELICOPTER ENTERED A 
DYNAMIC ROLLOVER.  THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR SAID HE WAS MONITORING THE 
MOVEMENTS OF THE STUDENT, HOWEVER, HE SAID HE HAD LET THE STUDENT GO 
TOO FAR PRIOR TO TAKING CORRECTIVE ACTION. 
 IMPROPER SUPERVISION BY THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR WHICH RESULTED IN AN 
INADVERTENT GROUND CONTACT AND A DYNAMIC ROLLOVER. A FACTOR RELATED 
TO THE ACCIDENT WAS IMPROPER USE OF THE FLIGHT CONTROLS BY THE NON-
RATED STUDENT PILOT.
