 THE PILOT WAS FLYING A NORMAL, VFR APPROACH FOR LANDING.  THE AIRCRAFT 
TOUCHED DOWN FAST, AND BOUNCED.  SOME DRIFT WAS ENCOUNTERED, AND THE 
PILOT EXECUTED A GO-AROUND.  HE DID NOT CORRECT FOR THE WIND DRIFT, AND 
THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH ADJACENT TREES.  THE AIRPLANE THEN IMPACTED 
THE GROUND IN A NOSE-LOW ATTITUDE.  THE PILOT HAD FLOWN ONLY 3 HOURS IN 
THIS MODEL OF AIRPLANE.  NO MECHANICAL DIFFICULTIES WERE REPORTED, AND 
NONE WERE FOUND DURING THE POSTACCIDENT INSPECTION. 
 THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL DURING THE GO-
AROUND ATTEMPT.  FACTOR(S) IN THIS ACCIDENT WERE: THE EXCESSIVE AIRSPEED 
AT TOUCHDOWN, AND THE PILOT'S LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS MODEL OF 
AIRPLANE.
