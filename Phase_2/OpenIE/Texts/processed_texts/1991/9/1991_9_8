 JUST AFTER TAKE OFF, THE AIRPLANE ENCOUNTERED A DOWN DRAFT.  THE PILOT 
LOWERED THE NOSE OF THE AIRPLANE TO INCREASE AIRSPEED AND MADE A RIGHT 
TURN PASSING OVER BUILDINGS, HANGARS, AND THE PARKING RAMP.  THE 
AIRPLANE COMPLETED A 360 DEGREE TURN AND THE RIGHT WING CONTACTED THE 
RAMP.  THE PILOT WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE TO FLY THE AIRPLANE AND RETURNED 
FOR LANDING WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. 
 POOR IN FLIGHT PLANNING/DECISION BY THE PILOT IN COMMAND. FACTORS TO 
THE ACCIDENT WERE: DOWN DRAFTS, PROPER ALIGNMENT WAS NOT MAINTAINED 
AND INADEQUATE REMEDIAL ACTION.
