 A PRIVATE PILOT WAS ADVISED BY THE WEATHER BRIEFER THAT VFR FLIGHT WAS 
NOT RECOMMENDED ALONG HIS ROUTE OF FLIGHT DUE TO LOW VISIBILITIES AND 
SNOW SHOWERS. THE NON INSTRUMENT RATED PILOT ELECTED TO DEPART ON HIS 
CROSS COUNTRY FIGHT AND ENCOUNTERED THE PREVIOUSLY FORECASTED 
WEATHER ENROUTE. THE HEAVY SHOW SHOWERS CAUSED A BLOCKAGE OF THE AIR 
INDUCTION FILTER SCREEN. THE PILOT MANAGED TO FOLLOW AN INTERSTATE 
HIGHWAY AT LOW ALTITUDE UNTIL AN AIRPORT WAS FOUND. WHILE LANDING, THE 
RIGHT MAIN LANDING GEAR IMPACTED A LARGE SNOW DRIFT, CAUSING THE 
AIRPLANE TO DRIFT OFF THE RUNWAY AND FLIP OVER. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT 
DUE TO HIS LOW ALTITUDE AND DIMINISHING POWER, HE WAS UNABLE TO 
PROPERLY ALIGN THE AIRPLANE WITH THE RUNWAY BEFORE LANDING. 
THE PILOT'S POOR JUDGEMENT IN ATTEMPTING FLIGHT INTO FORCASTED ADVERSE 
WEATHER, HIS DISREGARD FOR THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER ADVISORY RECEIVED 
WHICH RESULTED IN PARTIAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER AS A RESULT OF A BLOCKED 
INDUCTION SYSTEM DUE TO ICE AND SNOW, AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO 
PROPERLY ALIGN THE AIRCRAFT WITH THE RUNWAY.
