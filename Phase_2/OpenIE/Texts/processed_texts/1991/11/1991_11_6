 AFTER TAKEOFF WITH THE FUEL SELECTOR POSITIONED TO THE AUXILIARY FUEL 
TANK, THE ENG QUIT DUE TO FUEL EXHAUSTION IN THAT TANK.  THE PILOT 
REPOSITIONED THE FUEL SELECTOR TO THE MAIN FUEL TANK POSITION WHICH 
CONTAINED AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF FUEL, BUT THE ENG STARTED ONLY 
MOMENTARILY, THEN QUIT.  THE PILOT LANDED THE AIRCRAFT GEAR UP IN A FIELD. 
EXAM OF THE AIRCRAFT BY AN FAA AIRWORTHINESS INSPECTOR REVEALED THAT A 
RUBBER FUEL LINE WHICH CONNECTS THE MAIN TANK TO THE FUEL SELECTOR 
WAS BLOCKED BY CONTAMINANTS.  THE PILOT HAD IN THE PAST OPERATED THE ENG 
USING AUTOMOTIVE FUEL WITHOUT AN STC.  HE WAS ALSO AWARE BEFORE THE 
ACCIDENT THAT THE ENG WOULD LOSE POWER WITH THE FUEL SELECTOR 
POSITIONED TO THE MAIN TANK. 
 OPERATION BY THE OWNER/PILOT-IN-COMMAND WITH KNOWN DEFICIENCIES IN 
EQUIPMENT AND FUEL STARVATION DUE TO A BLOCKED FUEL LINE.
