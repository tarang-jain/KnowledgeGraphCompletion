 WITNESSES AT THE AIRPORT STATED THAT JUST AFTER THE AIRPLANE LIFTED OFF 
RUNWAY 16R, IT IMMEDIATELY BEGAN A VERY TIGHT 360 DEGREE TURN AND 
CRASHED BETWEEN RUNWAY 16L AND THE ADJACENT TAXIWAY. THE PILOT STATED 
TO FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) INSPECTORS THAT, AFTER LIFTOFF, 
THE AIRPLANE BEGAN TURNING TO THE LEFT AND TRYING TO DIVE AND THAT HE 
HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY OVERRIDING THE FORCES ON THE CONTROLS.  THE PILOT, 
WHO IS ALSO A CERTIFIED FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR, STATED THAT HE WAS FLYING THE 
AIRPLANE FROM THE RIGHT FRONT SEAT.  FAA INSPECTORS EXAMINED THE 
WRECKAGE AND FOUND THE RIGHT SEAT RUDDER PEDAL COLLAPSED TO THE 
FLOOR.  THE FAA INSPECTOR PULLED THE STOWABLE RUDDER PEDAL INTO THE 
FLIGHT POSITION, AND IT LOCKED IN PLACE.  WHEN THE FAA INSPECTOR APPLIED 
HAND PRESSURE TO BOTH PEDALS, THE RIGHT PEDAL SNAPPED INTO THE RETRACT 
POSITION.  HE ATTEMPTED THIS SEVERAL TIMES.  THE FAA INSPECTOR 
DISASSEMBLED THE PEDAL AND FOUND THAT THE PIN RECEIVING HOLE WAS WORN 
OBLONG, ALLOWING THE PIN TO DISENGAGE. 
THE INADVERTENT LOSS OF CONTROL DURING THE INITIAL CLIMB AFTER TAKEOFF 
THAT RESULTED FROM THE COLLAPSE OF THE RUDDER PEDAL BECAUSE OF A WORN 
LOCKING PIN HOLE IN THE RUDDER PEDAL STOWING SYSTEM, WHICH ALLOWED 
THE PIN TO DISENGAGE.
