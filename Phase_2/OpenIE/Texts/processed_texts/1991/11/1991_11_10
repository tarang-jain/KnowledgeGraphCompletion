 IN HIS WRITTEN STATEMENT THE PILOT SAID THAT WHILE REDUCING POWER 
DURING A STRAIGHT IN APPROACH FOR LANDING, THE ENGINE HAD A TOTAL LOSS 
OF POWER. THE PILOT EXECUTED A POWER OFF, GEAR UP FORCED LANDING IN A 
CONGESTED AREA.  THE AIRCRAFT LANDED ON ROUGH, UNEVEN TERRAIN CAUSING 
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.  THE PILOT THOUGHT THE ENGINE MAY HAVE HAD A VAPOR 
LOCK.  FAA INSPECTORS EXAMINED THE AIRCRAFT AND FOUND ABOUT 8 GALLONS 
OF NON-CONTAMINATED FUEL IN EACH FUEL TANK.  THEY ALSO PERFORMED AN 
OPERATIONAL CHECK ON THE ENGINE AND OPERATED THE ENGINE THROUGHOUT 
NORMAL OPERATIONAL LIMITS WITH NO ABNORMALITIES NOTED.  AIRCRAFT 
RECORDS WERE REVIEWED WITH NO DISCREPANCIES NOTED.  ALL AIRWORTHINESS 
DIRECTIVES, INCLUDING THOSE PERTAINING TO VAPOR LOCK, WERE NOTED AS 
BEING COMPLIED WITH.  NO CAUSE FOR THE POWER LOSS WAS FOUND. 
 THE TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DUE TO UNKNOWN REASON(S).  A FACTOR IN 
THIS ACCIDENT WAS THE LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN TO LAND THE AIRPLANE, 
WITHOUT INCURRING DAMAGE TO THE AIRPLANE.
