 THE 17 HOUR STUDENT PILOT WAS ON HIS SECOND SUPERVISED SOLO FLIGHT AND 
WAS PERFORMING TAKEOFFS AND LANDINGS. ON THE ACCIDENT LANDING THE 
PILOT SAID THAT THE AIRCRAFT BEGAN VEERING OFF THE RUNWAY AFTER 
TOUCHDOWN AND HE COULD NOT CORRECT THE SITUATION. THE AIRCRAFT 
GROUND LOOPED AND CAME TO REST OFF THE RUNWAY IN A PLOWED FIELD. 
DURING RETRIEVAL OF THE AIRCRAFT THE CONTROL, BRAKING AND STEERING 
SYSTEMS WERE EXAMINED BY A CERTIFIED AIRFRAME AND POWERPLANT 
MECHANIC AND FOUND TO BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL. 
 THE STUDENT PILOT'S IMPROPER USE OF THE FLIGHT CONTROLS AND HIS FAILURE 
TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT.  A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR 
IN THE ACCIDENT WAS THE STUDENTS LACK OF TOTAL EXPERIENCE.
