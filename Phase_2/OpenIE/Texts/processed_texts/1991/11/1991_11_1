 THE PILOT OF A SINGLE ENGINED AIRPLANE HAD JUST RECEIVED AN IFR 
CLEARANCE. THE AIRPLANE PERFORMED AN INTERSECTION TAKEOFF AT NIGHT 
WITH WINDS GUSTING TO 30 KNOTS AND BLOWING SNOW.  JUST PRIOR TO 
ROTATION THE PILOT STATED HE OBSERVED THE AIRSPEED INDICATOR 
DISPLAYING '0'.  HE DECIDED TO TAKEOFF BECAUSE HE BELIEVED INSUFFICIENT 
RUNWAY REMAINED FOR AN ABORTED TAKEOFF. AFTER TAKEOFF THE PILOT 
STATED HIS OTHER PRESSURE INSTRUMENTS WERE NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.  
THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH TREE AND TERRAIN APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES 
FROM THE AIRPORT'S CENTER.  THE ON SCENE INVESTIGATION REVEALED A SLIGHT 
TRACE OF ICE WAS ON THE WINGS LEADING EDGE.  ONE OF THE TWO STATIC PORTS 
WAS FOUND WITH ICE BLOCKING IT.  THE SECOND STATIC PORT WAS DESTROYED 
DURING THE CRASH SEQUENCE.  THE ALTERNATE STATIC SOURCE SWITCH WAS 
FOUND IN THE 'STANDBY' POSITION.  THE PILOT STATED, 'I FIGURED I COULD USE 
THE ALTERNATE STATIC SOURCE ONCE I WAS UP HIGH ENOUGH TO CLEAR THE 
TREES.' 
 INADEQUATE PREFLIGHT PLANNING AND PREPARATION BY THE PILOT IN 
COMMAND, THE NON PERFORMANCE O FAN EMERGENCY PROCEDURE AND NOT 
MAINTAINING A POSITIVE RATE OF CLIMB ON BEHALF OF THE PILOT IN COMMAND.  
FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WERE THE PILOT IN COMMAND'S NOT 
REMOVING ICE FROM THE AIRPLANE, NOT OBTAINING ALTITUDE DURING THE 
CLIMB, AND NOT MAINTAINING DIRECTIONAL CONTROL.
