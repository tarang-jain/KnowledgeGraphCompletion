THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED DURING THE PILOT'S SECOND ATTEMPT TO FLY TO HIS 
DESTINATION. ACCORDING TO AIRPORT PERSONNEL, HE DID NOT REFUEL THE 
AIRPLANE AFTER HE RETURNED FROM THE FIRST ATTEMPT. HE HAD ONLOADED 
43.6 GALLONS OF FUEL BEFORE DEPARTING ON THE FIRST FLIGHT. AFTER 
DEPARTING RUTHERFORDTON ON THE SECOND FLIGHT, THE AIRPLANE WAS 
OBSERVED ABOUT 400 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND 4 MILES NORTH OF MONROE. 
ONE WITNESS REPORTED THAT THE RIGHT ENGINE WAS SPUTTERING AS IT FLEW 
OVERHEAD; SECONDS LATER, THE AIRPLANE CRASHED INTO A WOODED AREA. A 
WRECKAGE EXAMINATION DISCLOSED THAT THE FUEL SYSTEM WAS EMPTY. NO 
FUEL WAS FOUND IN THE LEFT ENGINE FUEL FLOW DIVIDER. AIRPORT PERSONNEL 
ALSO REPORTED THE PILOT WAS NOT KNOWLEDGEABLE OF THE AIRCRAFT FUEL 
SYSTEM. ACCORDING TO THE OWNER'S MANUAL, THE FUEL CONSUMPTION RATE 
FOR CRUISE AT 75% POWER WAS ABOUT 16 GALLONS PER HOUR PER ENGINE. THE 
PILOT HAD OPERATED THE ENGINES APPROXIMATELY 2 HOURS 10 MINUTES 
BEFORE THEY LOST POWER. 
INADEQUATE PREFLIGHT BY THE PILOT, WHICH RESULTED IN FUEL EXHAUSTION, 
DUE TO AN INADEQUATE SUPPLY OF FUEL. THE PILOT'S LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH 
THE AIRCRAFT FUEL SYSTEM WAS A RELATED FACTOR.
