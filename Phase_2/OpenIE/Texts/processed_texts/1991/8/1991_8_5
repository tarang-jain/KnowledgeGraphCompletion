 THE PILOT STATED HE WAS MAKING A LOW PASS (ABOUT 4 FEET ABOVE THE CROPS) 
FOR PURPOSE OF AERIAL APPLICATION WHEN 'THE ENGINE SURGED....' WHEN HE 
LOOKED DOWN TO TROUBLESHOOT THE PROBLEM HE TOOK HIS EYES OFF THE 
CROP.  HE REPORTED 'THE NEXT THING I KNEW I WAS IN THE CORN, I PULLED BACK 
OUT OF IT, BUT THE INTAKE HAD INGESTED TOO MUCH CORN.  THE ENGINE SEEMED 
LIKE IT WAS RUNNING ON 3 CYLINDERS...' THE AIRPLANE STRUCK A ROW OF CEDAR 
AND SETTLED INTO A CORN FIELD. 
 THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE CLEARANCE FROM CROPS DURING 
AERIAL APPLICATION MANEUVERS.  RELATED FACTORS ARE THE FAILURE OF A 
PROPELLER PITCH CHANGE MECHANISM AND THE PILOT'S DIVERTED ATTENTION.
