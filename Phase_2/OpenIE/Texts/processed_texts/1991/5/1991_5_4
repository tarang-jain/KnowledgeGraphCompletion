SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF, WHILE CLIMBING TO CRUISE ALTITUDE, THE PILOT 
REPORTED THE LEFT ENGINE COWL ASSEMBLY HAD COME OFF. WITNESSES 
OBSERVED THE AIRPLANE AT LOW ALTITUDE AND NOTED THAT IT WAS 'YAWING, 
SPUTTERING, AND ROCKING BACK AND FORTH.'  THEY INDICATED THE LEFT ENGINE 
WAS NOT RUNNING AND THAT THE AIRPLANE BANKED SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT AND 
DISAPPEARED BEHIND TREES BEFORE CRASHING. AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED 
THE LEFT PROPELLER HAD NOT BEEN FEATHERED. THE LEFT ENGINE COWLING 
WAS FOUND 1.8 MILES FROM THE ACCIDENT SITE. THE THREE PRIMARY (EYEBOLT) 
COWL FASTERERS ON THE OUTBOARD SIDE OF THE LEFT UPPER COWL WERE FOUND 
UNLOCKED AND SEVEN OTHER COWL ATTACHING STUDS (SCREWS) WERE MISSING. 
THE COWLING HAD BEEN REMOVED 16 DAYS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT TO INSTALL AN 
OIL/AIR SEPARATOR. THIS WAS THE FIRST FLIGHT SINCE THAT WORK WAS 
PERFORMED. THE MECHANIC, WHO DID THE WORK, SAID HE NOTED SEVERAL COWL 
STUD FASTENERS WERE MISSING AND THAT HE HAD NOTIFIED THE PILOT. THE PILOT 
WAS REPORTED TO HAVE REPLIED THAT HE HAD SOME FASTENERS AND WOULD TAKE 
CARE OF THE PROBLEM. 
IN-FLIGHT SEPARATION OF THE LEFT ENGINE COWL ASSEMBLY THAT WAS NOT 
PROPERLY LAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLHED, AND FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM 
CONTROL SPEED, WHICH RESULTED IN HIS LOSS OF AIRCRAFT CONTROL.  FACTORS 
RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: AN INADEQUATE PREFLIGHT INSPECTION, 
INADEQUATE MARKINGS/ALIGNMENT INDICATIONS TO ASSURE THAT THE COWL 
FASTENERS WERE LOCKED, AND AN INSUFFICIENTLY DEFINED PROCEDURE IN THE 
FLIGHT MANUAL FOR CHECKING THE COWL FASTENERS.
