 THE AIRCRAFT COMPLETED AN INSTRUMENT APPROACH AND LANDED HARD ON 
THE RUNWAY SURFACE FIRST WITH THE LEFT GEAR THEN THE RIGHT GEAR.  THE 
TIRES BURST AND THE LOWER FUSELAGE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE RUNWAY 
SURFACE. AFTER THE NOSE GEAR TOUCHED DOWN, THE RIGHT MAIN LANDING 
GEAR COLLAPSED AND THE PILOT LOST CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT.  IT VEERED TO 
THE LEFT AND DEPARTED THE RUNWAY, COMING TO REST APPROXIMATELY 150 TO 
200 YARDS FROM THE POINT OF DEPARTURE.  INITIAL TOUCH DOWN OCCURRED 
ABOUT 12 FEET FROM THE THRESHOLD, TEN FEET LEFT OF CENTERLINE. 
 THE FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN THE PROPER LANDING DESCENT RATE 
AND THE RESULTANT RIGHT MAIN LANDING GEAR ASSEMBLY COLLAPSE.
