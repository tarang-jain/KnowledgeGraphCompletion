 DURING INITIAL CLIMB AFTER TAKEOFF FROM A HIGH ALTITUDE AIRPORT AND AT 
A GROSS WEIGHT 70 POUNDS BELOW MAXIMUM, BOTH ENGINE LOST INPUT TO 
THEIR TURBOCHARGERS DUE TO EXHAUST SYSTEM FAILURE.  AT THE REDUCED 
POWER AVAILABLE, THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO RETURN TO THE AIRPORT AND 
CONDUCTED AN EMERGENCY LANDING IN A FIELD.  THE TERRAIN WAS ROLLING, 
SOFT, AND THE LANDING GEAR COLLAPSED DURING LANDING ROLL.  THE ENGINE 
NACELLES AND UNDERSIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT WERE DAMAGED AS THE AIRCRAFT 
SLID DURING THE FINAL PHASE OF DECELERATION. 
 POWER LOSS ON BOTH ENGINES AS A RESULT OF EXHAUST SYSTEM FAILURE.
