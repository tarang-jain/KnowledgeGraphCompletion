 THE PILOT STATED THAT HE HAD REDUCED ENGINE POWER TO IDLE AND MADE A 
LOW PASS OVER A SNOW COVERED STRIP.  WHEN HE ADDED POWER TO RESUME 
THE FLIGHT, THE ENGINE FAILED.  THERE WAS NO SUITABLE FORCED LANDING 
AREA AVAILABLE.  THE PILOT DID NOT REMEMBER APPLYING CARBURETOR HEAT 
UNTIL AFTER THE ENGINE FAILED. 
 THE ENGINE FAILURE DUE TO UNDETERMINED CAUSES.  CONTRIBUTING TO THE 
ACCIDENT WAS THE UNSUITABILITY OF THE AVAILABLE LANDING AREA.
