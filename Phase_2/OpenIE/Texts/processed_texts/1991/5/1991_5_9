 AERIAL APPLICATION PASSES WERE BEING MADE NORTH TO SOUTH WITH EACH 
PASS BEING BENEATH CROSS COUNTRY POWER LINES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
FIELD. ONE FLAGMAN WAS POSITIONED AT ONE END OF THE FIELD WITH A SECOND 
BENEATH THE POWER LINES. DURING THE SIXTH PASS, FOR UNKNOWN REASONS, 
THE FLAGMAN FAILED TO MOVE AS THE AIRPLANE APPROACHED. ACCORDING TO 
THE PILOT, 'DUE TO THE HEIGHT OF THE WIRES AND THEIR CLOSE PROXIMITY, I 
WAS COMMITTED TO PASS UNDER THEM.' HE UNSUCCESSFULLY ATTEMPTED TO 
PASS BENEATH THE WIRES AND OVER THE FLAGMAN. THE LEFT MAIN GEAR STRUCK 
THE FLAGMAN AND THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH A LEVEE BEFORE CONTROL 
COULD BE REGAINED. AN UNEVENTFUL LANDING FOLLOWED. 
 THE FAILURE OF THE FLAGMAN TO FOLLOW ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES.
