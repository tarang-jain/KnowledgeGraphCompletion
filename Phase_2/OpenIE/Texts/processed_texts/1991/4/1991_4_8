AFTER REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO LOWER THE LANDING GEAR, ONLY THE LEFT MAIN 
AND NOSE GEAR WOULD EXTEND.  THE PILOTS ELECTED TO MAKE A WHEELS-UP 
LANDING.  DURING THE LANDING, THE LOWER FUSELAGE AND PROPELLER TIPS 
RECEIVED MINOR DAMAGE.  AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE RIGHT MAIN 
LANDING GEAR PIVOT ASSEMBLY (PN 2441100-1) HAD FAILED.  A METALLURGICAL 
EXAMINATION DISCLOSED THE SPLINED SHAFT ON THE PIVOT ASSEMBLY HAD 
FRACTURED IN TORSIONAL OVERLOAD.  AS A RESULT, MECHANICAL EXTENSION OF 
THE RIGHT MAIN LANDING GEAR WAS NOT POSSIBLE. 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
FAILURE OF THE SPLINED SHAFT ON THE RIGHT MAIN LANDING GEAR PIVOT 
ASSEMBLY.  A FACTOR RELATED TO THE INCIDENT WAS INADEQUATE DESIGN OF 
THE LANDING GEAR PIVOT ASSEMBLY.
