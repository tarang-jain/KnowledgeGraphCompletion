 THE CERTIFICATED COMMERCIAL PILOT, WITH ONE PASSENGER, WAS ON A FLIGHT 
BETWEEN TWO TUNA FISHING VESSELS IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS.  AS THE PILOT 
BEGAN A CLIMB FROM ABOUT 100 FEET ABOVE THE WATER, HE DISCOVERED THAT 
THE CYCLIC CONTROL WAS BINDING IN ITS LONGITUDINAL AXIS.  THE HELICOPTER 
CONTINUED TO CLIMB UNTIL IT REACHED A NEAR VERTICAL ATTITUDE.  THE PILOT 
APPLIED RUDDER PEDAL TO SWING THE NOSE DOWN.  THE HELICOPTER THEN 
DESCENDED RAPIDLY TO THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN WHERE A FLOAT ATTACHED 
TO THE LANDING GEAR SKID CONTACTED THE WATER.  THE FLOATS WERE TORN 
OFF AND THE HELICOPTER CARTWHEELED AND SANK.  THE PILOT AND PASSENGER 
RECEIVED MINOR INJURIES.  THE HELICOPTER WAS NOT RECOVERED. 
 THE LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE HELICOPTER DUE TO A RESTRICTION OF THE CYCLIC 
CONTROL SYSTEM.
