 THE PILOT WAS FLYING THE EXPERIMENTAL, HOME-BUILT AIRPLANE FOR THE 
FIRST TIME.  HE EXPRESSED RESERVATIONS ABOUT FLYING THE AIRPLANE.  THE 
PILOT'S FAMILY ARRIVED AT THE AIRPORT WITH A VIDEO CAMERA TO RECORD THE 
FLIGHT. AFTER MUCH HESITATION, THE PILOT TOOK OFF.  HE CIRCLED THE 
AIRPORT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AT A LOW ALTITUDE.  THEN THE AIRPLANE 
STALLED AND SPUN INTO THE GROUND. 
 THE FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN AIRSPEED, WHICH RESULTED IN A STALL 
AND SPIN AT A LOW ALTITUDE.  ALSO CAUSAL TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE LACK OF 
EXPERIENCE OF THE PILOT IN THIS MAKE AND MODEL AIRPLANE.
