THE PILOT WAS DOING AN AERIAL SPRAY OF A WOODED AREA WHEN THE LOW RPM 
WARNING SOUNDED. HE THEN NOTICED THE ROTOR/ENGINE RPM READING WAS 
DECREASING RAPIDLY.  THE PILOT DID AN AUTOROTATION DESCENT.  DURING THE 
LANDING THE AIRCRAFT STRUCK TREES AND THEN IMPACTED THE GROUND. THE AIRCRAFT 
CAME TO REST ON ITS LEFT SIDE. THE EXAMINATION OF THE AIRCRAFT DID NOT 
DISCLOSE EVIDENCE OF MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION. 
THE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS, WHILE OPERATING 
OVER UNSUITABLE TERRAIN.
