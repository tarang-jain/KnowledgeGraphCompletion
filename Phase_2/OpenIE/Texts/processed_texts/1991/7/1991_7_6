 A PRIVATE PILOT LANDED LONG AND FAST ON A 2085 FOOT SOD STRIP, BOUNCED 
AND APPLIED POWER TO ABORT THE LANDING.  THE AIRPLANE DRAGGED THROUGH 
CORN AND LOW TREETOPS PAST RUNWAY END, LOSING SPEED.  THE AIRPLANE 
STALLED INTO A HIGHER TREELINE BEYOND. 
 THE PILOT'S DELAY IN ABORTING THE LANDING.  A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT WAS 
HIS EXCESSIVE SPEED ON FINAL APPROACH.
