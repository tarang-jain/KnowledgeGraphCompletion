THE FLIGHT WAS FOR THE PURPOSE OF X-COUNTRY TRAINING. THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR 
(CFI) CLOSED THE THROTTLE AT AN ALT OF ABT 900' AGL TO SIMULATE AN ENG 
FAILURE. DRG A SUBSEQUENT AUTOROTATION, ENG RPM WAS NOT MAINTD AT 2500 
AS RCMDD BY THE PILOT'S OPERG HANDBOOK (POH). THE STUDENT ALLOWED THE 
ROTOR RPM TO DETERIORATE DRG AN ATMTD POWER ON RECOVERY AT ABT 700' AGL 
AS HE DID NOT REALIZE THE ENG HAD STOPPED RUNNING. THE CFI ATMTD TO 
RESTART THE ENG AFTER TAKING CTL OF THE HELICOPTER AT ABT 700' AGL. THE 
STUDENT RPRTD THE ROTOR RPM REMAINED LOW DRG THE DSCNT. 
SUBSEQUENTLY, THE HELICOPTER IMPACTED IN A LARGE FLD. THE STUDENT 
STATED THAT THE HELICOPTER FELT AS IF IT JUST DROPPED THE LAST FEW FEET OF 
THE AUTOROTATION. NO REASON WAS VERIFIED FOR THE LOSS OF ENG PWR. THE 
POH STATED THAT RPM SHOULD HAVE BEEN MAINTD DRG PRACTICE 
AUTOROTATIONS AND THAT ENG RESTARTS SHOULD NOT BE ATMTD BELOW 2000' AGL. 
LOSS OF ENGINE POWER FOR AN UNDETERMINED REASON, AND FAILURE OF THE 
INSTRUCTOR PILOT (CFI) TO FOLLOW PROCEDURES AND MAINTAIN ROTOR RPM.
