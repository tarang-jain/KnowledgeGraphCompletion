 DURING AN INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT FOR A COMMERCIAL CERTIFICATE THE CFI 
DEMONSTRATED A SIMULATED ENGINE OUT, SPIRAL APPROACH TO THE RUNWAY. 
THE DUAL STUDENT THEN PERFORMED A SIMILAR MANEUVER. ON SHORT FINAL 
THE STUDENT ALLOWED THE AIRPLANE TO STALL WHICH RESULTED IN A HARD 
LANDING SHORT OF THE RUNWAY. 
 THE DUAL STUDENT ALLOWED THE AIRPLANE TO STALL BECAUSE OF IMPROPER 
USE OF THE THROTTLE, WHICH RESULTED IN A TOUCH DOWN SHORT OF THE 
PROPER POINT. A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT WAS THE INADEQUATE SUPERVISION 
BY THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR.
