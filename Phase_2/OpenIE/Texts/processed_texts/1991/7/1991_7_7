 THE STUDENT PILOT HAD JUST BEEN RELEASED BY HIS INSTRUCTOR FOR HIS 
SECOND SUPERVISED SOLO FLIGHT.  AFTER TAKEOFF, HE STAYED IN CLOSED 
TRAFFIC.  ON HIS APPROACH TO LANDING, HE MISJUDGED HIS LANDING FLARE.  
WHEN HE ADDED POWER FOR A GO-AROUND, HE LOST DIRECTIONAL CONTROL OF 
THE AIRCRAFT.  THE WING STRUCK THE GROUND, THE AIRCRAFT CARTWHEELED, 
AND THEN CAME TO REST UPSIDE DOWN. 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT. A 
FACTOR WAS THE PILOT MISJUDGING HIS FLARE.
