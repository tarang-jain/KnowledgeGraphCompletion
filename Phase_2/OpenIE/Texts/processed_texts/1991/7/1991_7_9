THE LANDING GEAR COLLAPSED DURING THE LANDING ROLL. THE PILOT HAD 
ACCUMULATED A TOTAL OF 27 HOURS IN THE AIRPLANE AFTER RECEIVING A 
MULTIENGINE RATING. EXAMINATION OF THE AIRPLANE AT THE SCENE SHOWED 
THE GEAR HANDLE IN THE DOWN POSITION AND THE LANDING GEAR CIRCUIT 
BREAKER POPPED. DAMAGE TO THE GEAR DOORS AND GEAR ACTUATING RODS 
INDICATED THAT THE PILOT SELECTED GEAR UP INSTEAD OF FLAPS UP BEFORE THE 
GEAR STRUT SQUAT SWITCHES ACTIVATED TO PREVENT THE GEAR FROM 
RETRACTING. THE PILOT THEN SELECTED THE GEAR DOWN POSITION BUT THE 
WEIGHT OF THE AIRPLANE PREVENTED THE GEAR FROM EXTENDING, POPPING THE 
GEAR MOTOR CIRCUIT BREAKER. PRIOR TO OPERATING THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE, 
IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS, THE PILOT OPERATED A TAILWHEEL, FIXED GEAR 
AIRPLANE. 
 THE PILOT'S IMPROPER USE OF THE LANDING GEAR RETRACTION BY SELECTING 
GEAR UP INSTEAD OF FLAPS UP DURING THE LANDING ROLL-OUT.  CONTRIBUTING 
TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH THE AIRPLANE.
