SKW5569, N683AV, HAD BEEN CLEARED TO RUNWAY 24L, AT INTERSECTION 45, TO 
POSITION AND HOLD. THE LOCAL CONTROLLER, BECAUSE OF HER PREOCCUPATION 
WITH ANOTHER AIRPLANE, FORGOT SHE HAD PLACED SKW5569 ON THE RUNWAY 
AND SUBSEQUENTLY CLEARED USA1493, N388US, FOR LANDING. AFTER THE 
COLLISION, THE TWO AIRPLANES SLID OFF THE RUNWAY INTO AN UNOCCUPIED 
FIRE STATION. THE TOWER OPERATING PROCEDURES DID NOT REQUIRE FLIGHT 
PROGRESS STRIPS TO BE PROCESSED THROUGH THE LOCAL GROUND CONTROL 
POSITION. BECAUSE THIS STRIP WAS NOT PRESENT, THE LOCAL CONTROLLER 
MISIDENTIFIED AN AIRPLANE AND ISSUED A LANDING CLEARANCE. THE TECHNICAL 
APPRAISAL PROGRAM FOR AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS IS NOT BEING FULLY 
UTILIZED BECAUSE OF A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING BY SUPERVISORS AND THE 
UNAVAILABILITY OF APPRAISAL HISTORIES. 
THE FAILURE OF THE LOS ANGELES AIR TRAFFIC FACILITY MANAGEMENT TO 
IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES THAT PROVIDED REDUNDANCY COMPARABLE TO THE 
REQUIREMENTS CONTAINED IN THE NATIONAL OPERATIONAL POSITION 
STANDARDS AND THE FAILURE OF THE FAA AIR TRAFFIC SERVICE TO PROVIDE 
ADEQUATE POLICY DIRECTION AND OVERSIGHT TO ITS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL 
FACILITY MANAGERS. THESE FAILURES CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT IN THE LOS 
ANGELES AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER THAT ULTIMATELY LED TO THE FAILURE 
OF THE LOCAL CONTROLLER 2 (LC2) TO MAINTAIN AN AWARENESS OF THE TRAFFIC 
SITUATION, CULMINATING IN THE INAPPROPRIATE CLEARANCES AND THE 
SUBSEQUENT COLLISION OF THE USAIR AND SKYWEST AIRCRAFT. CONTRIBUTING 
TO THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS THE FAILURE OF THE FAA TO PROVIDE 
EFFECTIVE QUALITY ASSURANCE OF THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM. (NTSB REPORT AAR-91/08)
