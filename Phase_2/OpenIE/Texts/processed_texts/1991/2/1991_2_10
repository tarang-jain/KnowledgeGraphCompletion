 THE PILOT HAD JUST DEPARTED THE AIRPORT ON AN IFR FLIGHT AND WAS 
CLIMBING THROUGH 5,500 FEET WHEN THE AIRCRAFT SUDDENLY LOST 
SIGNIFICANT POWER. HE IMMEDIATELY PERFORMED THE EMERGENCY 
PROCEDURES FOR LOSS OF POWER BUT COULD NOT CORRECT THE SITUATION. WITH 
INSUFFICIENT POWER TO RETURN TO HIS DEPARTURE FIELD, HE ELECTED TO LAND 
ON A RECLAIMED STRIP MINE. ON TOUCHDOWN, THE NOSE LANDING GEAR BROKE 
AWAY AND THE AIRCRAFT TIPPED ON ITS NOSE AND CAME TO REST INVERTED 
CAUSING SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. SUBSEQUENT INSPECTION OF THE ENGINE 
REVEALED DAMAGE IN THE NUMBER THREE CYLINDER CAUSED BY A BROKEN 
EXHAUST VALVE. 
 THE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER BROUGHT ON BY A FAILURE OF THE NUMBER THREE 
CLYINDER EXHAUST VALVE. CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS UNSUITABLE 
TERRAIN ON THE EMERGENCY LANDING FIELD.
