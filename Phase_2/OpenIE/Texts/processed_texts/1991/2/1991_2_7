THE PILOT AND TWO PASSENGERS WERE FLYING TO AN AIRPORT TO PICK UP A 
FRIEND. NIGHT VMC PREVAILED. WITNESSES OBSERVED THE AIRPLANE FLYING AT 
ABOUT 300 FEET AGL AT VARIOUS POSITIONS OVER THE CITY, VARYING HEADINGS, 
AND SOMETIMES CIRCLING. ONE WITNESS STATED THAT THE PILOT 'SEEMED LIKE 
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS GOING.'  THE AIRPLANE THEN PROCEEDED 
TOWARD THE MIDFIELD POINT OF THE AIRPORT ON A NORTHERLY HEADING. IT 
COLLIDED WITH PINE TREES, THEN FELL INTO THE ROOF OF A CHURCH LOCATED 
150 FEET FARTHER NORTH. THE AIRCRAFT, AND CHURCH, WERE DESTROYED BY 
FIRE. THE FUEL SELECTOR VALVE WAS FOUND IN THE 'LEFT AUX' TANK POSITION; 
HOWEVER, AUX TANKS WERE TO BE USED IN LEVEL FLIGHT ONLY. ACTUATOR 
SETTINGS INDICATED THE GEAR WAS DOWN AND THE FLAPS WERE UP. PROP 
SIGNATURES INDICATED PROP ROTATION IN A POWER PRODUCING MODE AT 
IMPACT. THE RUNWAY LIGHTS FOR RUNWAY 9/27 WERE ON AT THE TIME, AND THE 
AIRCRAFT'S NORTHERLY HEADING WAS NOT ALIGNED WITH ANY RUNWAY. THE 
LOCATION OF THE AIRPORT DID NOT REQUIRE THE CITY TO BE OVERFLOWN. 
FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO ATTAIN PROPER RUNWAY ALIGNMENT AND TO MAINTAIN 
PROPER ALTITUDE.  RELATED FACTORS WERE: DARKNESS AND THE PILOT 
BECOMING LOST/DISORIENTED.
