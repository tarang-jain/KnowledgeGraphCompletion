THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND STATED THAT HIS ENGINE WAS NOT PRODUCING 
SUFFICIENT POWER AND HE WAS UNABLE TO CLEAR TREES. HIS ENGINE DID NOT 
STOP TURNING.  EXAMINATION OF THE TERRAIN SHOWED THAT HE TURNED 
TOWARD RISING TERRAIN WHEN HE STATED HE WAS HAVING AN ENGINE PROBLEM.  
FURTHERMORE, AN ENGINE TEST RUN SHOWED NO MECHANICAL REASON FOR THE 
LOSS OF POWER. THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD THE AIRPLANE 
WRECKAGE AND ENGINE AND STATED TO THE BUYER THAT THERE WAS NOT AN 
ENGINE PROBLEM; THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO OUTCLIMB THE TERRAIN. 
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CLEARANCE FROM THE TERRAIN.
