 THE AIRCRAFT WAS ON CLIMB OUT WHEN A LOUD BANG WAS HEARD, FOLLOWED 
BY AN ENGINE OVERSPEED THEN ENGINE STOPPAGE.  AFTER THE FORCED LANDING, 
THE PILOTS FOUND THAT BOTH WOODEN PROPELLER BLADES HAD SEPARATED 
FROM THE STEEL HUB ASSEMBLY.  THE PROPELLER HUB WAS REMOVED FROM THE 
ENGINE AND SENT TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS AND 
DISASSEMBLY UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF FAA INSPECTORS.  THE MANUFACTURER 
STATED THAT ALL INTERNAL COMPONENTS WERE FUNCTIONAL, HOWEVER, THE 
CAM ADJUSTMENT FOR THE HIGH AND LOW PITCH STOP SETTINGS HAD BEEN 
ALTERED FROM THE FACTORY SETTINGS. THE BLADE BUTT ENDS RETAINED IN THE 
HUB WERE REMOVED AND SUBMITTED TO THE FOREST PRODUCTS LABORATORY OF 
THE US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE FOR ANALYSIS.  ACCORDING TO THE 
LABORATORY THE WOODEN BLADES FRACTURED AND SEPARATED DUE TO A 
HYDROLYSIS INTERACTION BETWEEN THE WOOD AND THE ADHESIVE CAUSED BY 
EXCESS MOISTURE AND HEAT.  THE HYDROLYSIS IS A CHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION 
PROCESS OF THE WOOD AND GLUE RELATIONSHIP. 
 THE FAILURE OF THE PROPELLER BLADES DUE TO A WEAKENING OF THE WOOD 
STRUCTURE DUE TO ACID HYDROLYSIS.  A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT WAS THE 
INADEQUATE MAINTENANCE OF THE PROPELLER ASSEMBLY BY ALLOWING 
EXPOSURE TO EXCESSIVE MOISTURE AND HEAT.
