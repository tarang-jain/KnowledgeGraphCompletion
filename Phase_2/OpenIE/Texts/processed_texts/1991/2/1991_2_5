 AFTER LANDING WITHOUT INCIDENT WITH 35 TO 40 KNOT WINDS, THE AIRPLANE 
WAS BEING TAXIED TO THE PARKING RAMP, WHEN A GUST OF WIND FROM THE 
REAR RAISED THE TAIL OF THE AIRPLANE.  THE PROPELLER AND LEFT WING TIP 
CONTACTED THE GROUND. 
THE PILOT IMPROPER PLANNING/DECISIONS. THE HIGH WIND WAS A FACTOR.
