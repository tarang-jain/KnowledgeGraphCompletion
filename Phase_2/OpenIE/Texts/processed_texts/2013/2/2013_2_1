The private pilot was attempting a soft field takeoff on a paved runway. He advanced the 
throttle to the full forward position and applied full back pressure on the flight controls to 
begin the takeoff roll. However, the airplane veered to the left. The pilot tried to counteract the 
veer by applying right rudder and when that was unsuccessful, elected to reject the takeoff. The 
airplane™s horizontal stabilizer was substantially damaged when the airplane exited the runway 
and struck a frangible airport sign. Postaccident examination revealed no mechanical 
malfunctions or anomalies with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
The pilot™s failure to maintain control of the airplane during the takeoff roll.
