After performing three touch-and-go landings on a frozen lake, the pilot set up for a full stop 
landing on the plowed surface of the frozen lake. After a smooth landing, and while taxiing to 
park, the left wheel strut collapsed. The airplane tipped over onto its left side, resulting in 
substantial damage to the left wing spar. Examination of the airplane after the accident 
revealed evidence of fatigue cracking on the failed portion of the left wheel strut mount. The 
airplane had been flown about 50-75 hours after its last annual inspection with no problems 
noted by the owner. The pilot stated that he lands on frozen lakes frequently and that the 
collapse of the landing gear was unexpected.
