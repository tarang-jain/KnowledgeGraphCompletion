As the helicopter was flying west in the direction of the sun and at 250 feet above ground level, 
the pilot heard a loud "bang" and observed a black object go by the left side of the helicopter. 
The object struck the passenger-side windshield. The pilot performed a forced landing to a 
highway. During the forced landing, both landing skids separated and the helicopter slid to a 
stop. The lower fuselage was buckled and wrinkled in several locations. The pilot reported no 
preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter that would have precluded 
normal operation.
The helicopter landed hard during a forced landing.
