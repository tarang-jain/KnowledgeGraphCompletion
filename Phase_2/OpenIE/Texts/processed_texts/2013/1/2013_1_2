After the private pilot and flight instructor conducted a low pass over a snow-covered runway, 
the private pilot proposed returning to their home airport. However, the flight instructor 
elected to demonstrate a soft field touch-and-go landing on the snow-covered runway before 
the return flight. When the airplane touched down, the snow was deeper than the flight 
instructor anticipated, and the airplane slowed faster than he expected. The pilots added full 
power and increased back pressure on the control yoke; however, the airplane pitched forward 
on its nosewheel and then rolled right and left, striking both wings and substantially damaging 
both main wing spars. The pilots reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures 
with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
