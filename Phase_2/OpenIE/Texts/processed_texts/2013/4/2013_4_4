The pilot and a passenger departed from a private airport in a tandem-seat, tailwheel-equipped 
airplane, destined for a public airport about 3 miles to the south. The pilot reported that he 
performed a "short field" landing to a full stop on runway 12 and then began a takeoff from the 
stopping point. The airplane veered to the right, the pilot applied corrective inputs, but the 
airplane exited the left side of the runway and ground looped. Both wings sustained substantial 
damage. The weather about the time of the accident included wind from 360 degrees at 6 
knots. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions and that he lost control 
due to a wind gust.
