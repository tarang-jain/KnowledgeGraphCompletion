The pilot and the pilot-rated passenger planned to conduct a personal flight in the tailwheel-
equipped airplane. The pilot was in the rear seat, and the passenger was in the front seat. The 
passenger did not have a tailwheel endorsement, but he planned to follow the pilot on the 
controls during the takeoff for familiarization purposes. During the takeoff roll when the 
airplane was approaching liftoff speed, the airplane made a rapid veeroff to the left. At that 
point, the pilot abandoned the takeoff, and made the conscious decision not to attempt to 
return to the runway, instead allowing the airplane to roll and decelerate on the grass/gravel 
beside the runway. That decision was based on the pilot's desire to avoid any potentially 
hazardous maneuvering or a ground loop. During the rollout, due to the pilot's inability to see 
directly ahead, the airplane struck the VASI (visual approach slope indicator) installation 
located about 1,300 feet down the runway, and offset about 145 feet from the runway 
centerline. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing struts. The pilot stated 
that he did not believe that any mechanical malfunction or failure contributed to or caused the 
runway excursion, and that he could not rule out the possibility that he had inadvertently 
applied one wheel brake during the takeoff roll.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the takeoff roll, which resulted in a 
runway excursion and a collision with an approach slope indicator system component.
