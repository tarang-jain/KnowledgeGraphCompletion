The pilot of the amphibian airplane reported that she was flying a visual approach to a lake, 
over mountainous terrain. On an approximate 3/4 mile final approach to the lake, she 
observed a boat near her intended landing area and performed a go-around to circle for 
another approach. During the go-around and turn, the pilot did not move the throttle lever to 
full power. About one-fourth through the turn, she noticed the airplane was descending and 
increased engine power. The airplane continued to descend and she increased engine power a 
second time; however, one of the airplane's floats contacted a tree and the airplane impacted 
the ground. The pilot further stated that the accident could have been prevented if she had 
flown a higher approach and increased the throttle to full engine power immediately during the 
go-around. Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector 
revealed substantial damage to the wings and the fuselage. The pilot reported no preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions with the airplane and the inspector did not observe any.
