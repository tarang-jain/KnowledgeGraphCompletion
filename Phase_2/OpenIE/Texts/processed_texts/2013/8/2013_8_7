towards the right. The pilot did not act in a timely manner to prevent the airplane from 
departing the runway surface and the airplane subsequently struck foliage and sustained 
substantial damage to the wing. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical failures or 
malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
