The pilot stated that she entered the traffic pattern for runway 15, and established a stabilized 
approach with the airplane configured for landing. She reported that the airplane touched 
down in the runway landing zone; however, the airplane bounced and she added engine power 
in order to stabilize the airplane. At that time, the airplane encountered a gust of wind which 
resulted in the left main landing gear departing the runway pavement. The pilot noted that she 
added full engine power to initiate a go-around, and the airplane pitched up due to the added 
power and the pitch trim positioned for landing approach. She attempted to reduce the flap 
deflection to 10 degrees; however, the flaps may have been raised completely contributing to an 
inadvertent aerodynamic stall at a low altitude. The pilot noted that there were no 
malfunctions or failures associated with the airplane prior to the accident. She commented that 
due to the local terrain it is common to experience some turbulence on approach to runway 15. 
She reported that the wind was from 170 degrees at 6 knots, with moderate turbulence. Wind 
conditions recorded at local airports were southerly at 10 to 13 knots, with gusts to 17 knots.
The pilotâ„¢s inadequate recovery from a bounced landing in crosswind conditions, and an 
inadvertent aerodynamic stall during the subsequent go-around attempt.
