The flight instructor and the private pilot were performing practice takeoff and landings in the 
amateur-built experimental airplane so the pilot could provide an assessment of the airplane's 
handling qualities. The flight instructor reported that the pilot made a normal approach with 
full flaps and that the pilot made a "good landing with a normal touchdown." The pilot then 
commented that "it's skittish alright," and the airplane began to enter a ground loop. The flight 
instructor took over the controls, but the airplane exited the runway, continued through at 
least a portion of the ground loop, and dragged the right wingtip on the ground. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage to some right wing ribs and the right aileron. The flight 
instructor reported that the tower air traffic controller stated that the wind was "light and 
variable at 4 knots" about that time. The pilot reported that this was his first flight in the 
accident airplane make and model. Neither the flight instructor nor the pilot reported any 
preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded 
normal operation.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing. Contributing to the accident 
was the flight instructorâ„¢s delayed remedial action.
