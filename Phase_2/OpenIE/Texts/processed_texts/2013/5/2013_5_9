The flight instructor reported that during an instructional flight, the helicopter was 500 feet 
above ground level when he rolled the throttle off with the intent for the student to respond by 
initiating a straight-in autorotation. The student pilot did not respond properly, so the 
instructor took the controls to initiate a power recovery. The helicopter subsequently landed 
hard, deforming both skids and substantially damaging the airframe. The pilot did not report 
any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter that would have 
precluded normal operation.
The student pilotâ„¢s failure to maintain helicopter control during a practice autorotation and the 
flight instructor's delayed remedial action.
