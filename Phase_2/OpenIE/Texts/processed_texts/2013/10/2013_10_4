The student pilot stated they had been practicing hovering for about 30 minutes, and were 
about two feet above the ground. He recalled that he was "controlling the cyclic and maybe the 
collective, but not the pedals." The flight instructor thought they were three to five feet above 
the ground. The helicopter experienced a pendular motion and began traveling backwards and 
to the right. The right skid made contact with the ground, which resulted in the tail impacting 
the ground and the helicopter rolling onto its side. The helicopter sustained substantial 
damage to the tail rotor.
The flight instructor's failure to take remedial action in a timely manner.
