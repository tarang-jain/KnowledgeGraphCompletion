The pilot reported that during a test flight the airplane encountered moderate turbulence so he 
decided to return to the airport for landing. While turning to the crosswind leg in the pattern, 
the airplane suddenly banked sharply and descended uncontrollably. The pilot was able to 
regain control about 500 feet above ground level, and managed to turn the airplane to the 
downwind leg, but he continued to have difficulty maintaining control. The pilot then decided 
to make an emergency off airport landing to a field. During the landing roll, the airplane 
collided with obstructions and nosed over. The wings and fuselage were substantially damaged. 
After the accident, the pilot reported that the loss of aircraft control was due to a jammed 
rudder for undetermined reasons.
 
A jammed rudder control while maneuvering in the pattern for reasons that could not be 
determined. No follow-up examination was conducted due to a lapse in agency funding and 
subsequent government shutdown.
