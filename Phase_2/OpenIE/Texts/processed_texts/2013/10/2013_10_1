The pilot reported that he was practicing touch and go landings in the tail wheel equipped 
amateur-built airplane. During the landing, the airplane became "squirrely" and the pilot 
increased throttle in an effort to straighten the track on the runway. The airplane became 
airborne, however, did not have sufficient power to continue the takeoff climb. The airplane 
subsequently traveled off the runway and nosed over in a field. The underside of the fuselage 
and the rudder were substantially damaged. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control during landing.
