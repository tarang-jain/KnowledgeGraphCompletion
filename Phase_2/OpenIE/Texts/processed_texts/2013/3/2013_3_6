While waiting in the run-up area to taxi onto the runway, the pilot of the Cessna heard a loud 
noise and felt his airplane move. He shut down the engine and, after getting out of the airplane, 
he observed that the left wing of a Piper had collided with the left side of the Cessnaâ„¢s rudder 
and vertical stabilizer, tipping the vertical stabilizer to the right and twisting and buckling the 
fuselage. The pilot of the Piper reported that, while he was taxiing to get fuel with no intent for 
flight, he saw the tail of the Cessna directly in front of him. He applied right brake action and 
swiveled his airplane to avoid directly hitting the Cessna with the propeller. The pilot added 
that he had no idea why he was unable to see the Cessna in time to avoid the collision.
The failure of the pilot of another airplane, who was taxiing with no intent for flight, to 
maintain proper visual lookout.
