The pilot reported that he was flying a tail-wheel equipped airplane and conducting his second 
landing at a back country airstrip. During the landing flare, the airplane floated longer than 
expected and was starting to drift to the left side of the runway. The pilot added full power to 
go around when the left main landing gear struck a bush and the airplane turned sideways. The 
right landing gear collapsed and the right wing was substantially damaged when it struck the 
ground. The pilot reported that after exiting the airplane he noticed that the wind was a gusting 
right quartering tailwind. The pilot reported no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operations.
