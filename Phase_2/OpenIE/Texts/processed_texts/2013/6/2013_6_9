The pilot reported that while flying with a certified flight instructor (CFI) for his biannual 
review, they were simulating an engine failure over the airport with the intent to land on the 
runway. After spiraling to traffic pattern altitude, the pilot entered a downwind leg for the 
runway. The pilot turned towards the runway and inadvertently stalled the airplane about 200 
feet above the ground. The CFI took over the flight controls; the airplane struck the ground 
hard, broke off the right main landing gear, and bounced back into the air. The CFI climbed to 
a safe altitude and circled above the airport before conducting an uneventful landing onto the 
grass next to the runway. During the accident sequence, the right wing sustained substantial 
damage. The pilot reported no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or engine 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilotâ„¢s failure to maintain airplane control and the flight instructors failure to monitor the 
pilot during a simulated emergency landing.
