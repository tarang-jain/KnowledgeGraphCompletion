The pilot reported that he had flown into the airport previously, but never in the accident 
airplane. While on final approach, he noticed power lines between his position and the runway, 
and he "pulled back" on the pitch control to overfly the power lines. The pilot continued the 
approach and landing, but in the flare, the airplane "dropped and bounced." When the airplane 
was airborne after the bounce, he added power to initiate a go-around. However, the airplane 
did not climb as expected, and he was experiencing directional control problems. The pilot 
reduced power, and landed the airplane in a field adjacent to the runway. During the rollout in 
the field, the pilot noticed a ditch ahead of him, perpendicular to his direction of travel, and 
about 5 to 10 feet wide. He added power to attempt to fly over the ditch, but the main gear 
struck the far side of the ditch, which damaged the landing gear and fuselage structure. The 
airplane came to rest about two to three airplane lengths beyond the ditch. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage to the lower fuselage, right wing, and empennage, including the 
rudder control system. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures 
with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in an abnormal runway contact.
