The pilot reported that after the airplane touched down he saw a deer on the runway. There 
was not enough room to perform an aborted landing so he applied full brakes. After impacting 
the deer with the right wing, which resulted in substantial damage, the airplane veered off the 
runway and down an embankment. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions 
or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
