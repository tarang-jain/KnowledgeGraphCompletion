The pilot reported that the airplane "hesitated" during the takeoff roll due to the added weight 
of the passengers on board and the grass surface of the departure airstrip. He said he then 
added "extra" engine power at rotation, and that the left engine accelerated more quickly than 
the right, which resulted in an adverse yaw to the right and collision with trees along the right 
side of the runway. The subsequent collision with trees and terrain resulted in substantial 
damage to the airframe. According to the pilot, there were no mechanical deficiencies with the 
airplane that would have prevented normal operation.
