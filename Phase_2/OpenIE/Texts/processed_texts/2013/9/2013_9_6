The pilot reported that this was the first time landing his multi-engine airplane on his private 
grass airstrip. The flight handbook revealed that the required landing distance was about equal 
to the full length of the runway. The pilot reported performing a stabilized approach, with an 
intended touchdown point 200 feet down the runway. As he approached short final, the 
airplane began to sink, and he increased engine power. This did not arrest the descent, so he 
applied full engine power; however, the airplane touched down short of the runway and struck 
a fence post with the left wing, which resulted in substantial damage. The pilot reported no 
mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airframe or engine that would have precluded 
normal operation, and further stated that the accident could have been avoided if he had 
performed a go-around at the first indication of altitude loss.

aircraft control and collision with a fence post.
