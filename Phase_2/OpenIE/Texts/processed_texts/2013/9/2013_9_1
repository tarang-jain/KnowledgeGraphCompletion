Prior to departure, the pilot checked the weather and noted a storm was moving toward the 
area, and determined he needed to depart as soon as possible. During takeoff and while in 
ground effect, the airplane encountered a gust of wind that pushed the airplane™s left wing 
down. The pilot regained control and continued to initiate a climb in order to clear trees that 
were located near the end of the runway. The airplane encountered another gust of wind and 
the pilot attempted to compensate for the wind gust. Subsequently, the airplane impacted trees 
and terrain, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings. The pilot 
stated there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot™s failure to maintain aircraft control during initial climb in gusty wind conditions.
