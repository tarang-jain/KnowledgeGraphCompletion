During a practice touch-and-go landing, the student pilot did not properly maintain runway 
alignment during the landing flare. The flight instructor took control of the airplane as the 
wheels touched down on the runway, and attempted a go-around. However, during the go-
around, the flight instructor did not retract the flaps to 20 degrees, which the normal 
procedures require. Subsequently the airplane bounced, landed in an open area adjacent to the 
runway, and came to rest upright. During the accident sequence, the airplane sustained 
substantial damage to the wings and horizontal stabilizer. The flight instructor reported that 
there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
The student pilot's inadequate flare and the flight instructor's delayed remedial action and 
failure to maintain control of the airplane during a go-around. Contributing to the accident was 
the flight instructor's improper go-around procedures.
