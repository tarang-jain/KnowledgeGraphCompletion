The pilot of the amateur-built, amphibious, light-sport airplane reported that the airplane 
accelerated and lifted off from the asphalt runway without incident; however, during the initial 
climb it encountered "severe turbulence." The pilot was not able to control the airplane and 
was attempting to return to the airport when it landed hard in a soy bean field, resulting in 
substantial damage to the fuselage. Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine 
revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal 
operation; nor did the pilot report any. The pilot reported that wind at the time of the accident 
was light and variable, with gusts up to 8 knots.
The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control during the initial climb after takeoff in gusty 
wind conditions, which resulted in a hard off-airport landing.
