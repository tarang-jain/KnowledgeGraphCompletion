The airplane was destroyed when it impacted the terrain during landing approach.  The 
airplane came to rest about 1,000 feet short of the intended landing runway.  According to the 
air traffic controller (ATC), the pilot taxied and called for departure at 1543. The airplane was 
cleared for takeoff and was to maintain a  southwest heading after takeoff.  The controller 
stated that the pilot called to return to the field at 1545.  The controller asked the pilot if 
anything was wrong, because of the brief duration of the flight.  The controller stated that at 
this time the pilot reported no problems.  At 1546, the airplane was cleared to land.  At 1547, 
the pilot indicated a gear problem and requested to circle the field.  At 1550, the pilot informed 
the controller that "everything looks ok."  The airplane was again cleared to land.  At 1552, the 
airplane crashed approximately 1/2 mile south of runway 36.  No pre-impact defects were 
found with respect to the aircraft during a post-accident examination.  The reported winds 
were from 090 degrees at 5 knots.
The pilot in command not maintaining control of the aircraft during the final approach.
On November 1, 2003, at 1552 eastern standard time, an experimental amateur-built Master 
BD5B airplane, N515KH, piloted by a private pilot, was destroyed when it impacted the terrain 
during landing approach at the Cherry Capital Airport (TVC), Traverse City, Michigan.  The 
airplane came to rest about 1,000 feet short of runway 36 (5,107 feet by 150 feet, asphalt).  The

land.  At 1552, the airplane crashed approximately 1/2 mile south of runway 36.
The accident aircraft was an amateur-built Master BD5B, serial number 474.  The BD5B is an 
experimental category airplane with 1 seat.  The accident aircraft was powered by a Honda 
CX500 engine rated at 60 horsepower powering a pusher propeller.  The accident aircraft was 
issued its registration on July 15, 2003, pending a N number change, and received its
