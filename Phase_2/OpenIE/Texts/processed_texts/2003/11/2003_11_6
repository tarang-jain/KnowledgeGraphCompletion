While departing from runway 01, the airplane lifted off, about 1,000 feet down the 1,800-foot 
long wet turf runway.  The pilot felt a "strong breeze, almost a tailwind," and the airplane 
began to settle downward, touching back down on the runway surface.  The airplane then 
bounced back into the air, and would not climb out of ground effect.  The pilot decided not to 
abort the takeoff, fearing that the nosewheel would sink into the muddy runway, and flip the 
airplane over. As the airplane continued past the departure end of the runway, the airplane still 
would not climb, and pilot performed a forced landing to a marsh area.  After the accident, the 
pilot stated that he "should have aborted the takeoff when he first had the chance to."  The pilot 
additionally stated that the maximum allowable gross weight of the airplane was 2,350 pounds, 
and the takeoff weight at the time of the accident was 2,240 pounds.  Review of the Airplane 
Flight Manual revealed that the total takeoff ground roll, from a level, dry, hard surfaced 
runway, was about 1,248 feet.  No charts were available to compute a ground roll distance from 
a wet turf runway.  The winds reported by an airport located about 7 miles west of the accident 
site, at 1151, were from 150 degrees at 5 knots.
The pilot's delay in aborting the takeoff after his failure to obtain a proper climb rate.  Factors 
related to the accident were the tailwind conditions, and the wet turf runway.
