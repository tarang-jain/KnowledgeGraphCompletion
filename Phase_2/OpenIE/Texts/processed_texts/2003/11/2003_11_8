The pilot was on final approach, with landing flaps, at a low altitude, transitioning to land 
when deer ran in front of the airplane.  The pilot reported that he thought the airplane would 
strike the deer, and abruptly pulled back on the control wheel.  He also added power; however, 
the pitch up preceded the engine responding.  The pilot said the stall horn sounded 
momentarily, and then the airplane descended in a nose down attitude and struck the ground, 
about 150 feet short of the runway and slid for 100 feet.  The nose landing gear collapsed, the 
lower fuselage was crushed, and the firewall was wrinkled.  A witness reported that the final 
approach course brought the airplane over a corn field, where deer have been seen before.  The 
landing distance chart from the Owner's manual revealed the airplane could have crossed the 
end of the runway at 50 feet, and still stopped within the remaining runway.
The pilot's abrupt evasive maneuver to avoid the deer, which resulted in the loss of airspeed 
and an inadvertent stall.
