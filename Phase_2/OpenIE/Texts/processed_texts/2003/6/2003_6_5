The helicopter collided with a wire during high reconnaissance operations for a pinnacle 
approach.  The pilot was on his third pattern around the pinnacle when the helicopter collided 
with a wire that was strung from a pole to the side of a mountain.  The wire wrapped around 
the main rotor swash plate and the pilot entered an autorotation onto a hillside.  The tail rotor 
and boom were damaged upon touchdown.  The pilot estimated his altitude was 400 feet above 
ground level (agl) when the collision occurred.
