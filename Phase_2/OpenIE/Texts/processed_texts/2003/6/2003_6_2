The airplane sustained substantial damage when the right landing gear collapsed while landing 
on a 49-foot wide asphalt runway.  The pilot stated that upon touchdown the airplane instantly 
veered to the left.  The pilot reported that he applied full right rudder and the brakes, but could 
not regain control of the airplane.  The pilot stated that the right wing came in contact with the 
runway and the right landing gear collapsed.  The airplane then veered off the side of the 
runway.
The pilot not maintaining directional control of the airplane during landing.  A factor to the 
accident was the overload of the right main landing gear.
On June 1, 2003, about 2000 eastern daylight time, a Stinson 108-1, N8278K, piloted by a 
private pilot, sustained substantial damage when the right main landing gear collapsed during 
landing rollout on runway 32 (3,920 feet by 49 feet, asphalt) at the Riverview Airport, Jenison, 
Michigan.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The personal 
flight was operating under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91 without a flight plan.  The pilot and 
two passengers reported no injuries.  The flight departed from a private airstrip near 
Hudsonville, Michigan.
The pilot stated that upon touchdown the airplane instantly veered to the left.  The pilot 
reported that he applied full right rudder and the brakes, but could not regain control of the 
airplane.  The pilot stated that the right wing came in contact with the ground, and the right 
landing gear collapsed.  The airplane then "slid" off the left side of the runway, and the 
propeller struck the ground twice before the airplane came to a full stop.
