A passenger was seriously injured during a hard landing in a balloon ride .  The pilot released a 
line to his chase crew, who were unsuccessful in slowing the balloon down.  The pilot then 
climbed to clear obstacles and deployed the parachute top vent to descend onto a baseball field.  
The pilot deployed the aero chute vent during flare.  The balloon bounced three to four times 
before stopping.
The inadequate touchdown by the pilot.
On June 2, 2003, at 2007 central daylight time, an Aerostar S-77A, N52461, operated by 
Wiederkehr Balloon International, Inc., experienced a hard landing after a steep approach to a 
field near Cottage Grove, Minnesota.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of 
the accident.  The pilot and seven passengers reported no injuries, and one passenger reported 
serious injuries.  The 14 CFR Part 91 balloon ride flight was not operating on a flight plan.  The 
local flight departed about 1900.
The pilot reported that he attempted to land in a hay field.  A line was dropped to the chase 
crew, who were unsuccessful in slowing the balloon down.  The crew released the line allowing 
the balloon to climb over obstacles.  The pilot stated he deployed the parachute top vent to 
descend onto a baseball field.  He deployed the aero chute vent to flare the balloon before 
touching down.  The balloon bounced "three or four times" before coming to a stop in the 
upright position.
A passenger sustained a broken rib.
The ride balloon was undamaged.
