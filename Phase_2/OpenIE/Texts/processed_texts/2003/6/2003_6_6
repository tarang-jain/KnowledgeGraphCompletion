the pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the takeoff roll, which resulted in the 
airplane departing the runway, and impacting with trees.
On June 1, 2003, about 1032 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 172N, N9758G, registered to Four 
Fox Air Inc., and operated by an individual, impacted with an airport sign during the takeoff 
roll at the St. Petersburg/Clearwater International Airport, Clearwater, Florida.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for the 14 CFR Part 
91 personal flight.  The airplane was substantially damaged.  The private-rated pilot-in-
command and three passengers reported no injuries.  The flight was originating at the time.
According to the pilot he was departing runway 22, had started the takeoff roll, and the 
airspeed indicator had just started to move, when the airplane started to yaw to the left.  He 
applied right rudder, but the airplane continued to the left, departed the runway and impacted 
with an airport sign.
According to the FAA inspector, during an interview with the pilot, the pilot told him that he 
did not recall why the airplane yawed to the left, even after applying full right rudder.  The 
inspector stated that an inspection of the brakes and the rudder cables revealed that they all 
checked out "satisfactory."  In addition, the inspector stated that the pilot was 5 feet 3 inches 
tall, and that the seat may not have been close enough to get full deflection of the pedal.
