The pilot stated that he was performing touch-and-go landings, and had performed several 
with no problem. During his last touch-and-go landing, he said the left wheel came up off the 
runway, and as it again contacted the runway the airplane veered hard to the left. He said he 
tried to maintain control of the airplane, but while doing so, the right wheel rim dug into the 
asphalt further aggravating the ground loop. The airplane's right wing then impacted the 
runway surface, and its right main landing gear collapsed.
The pilot's failure to maintain control during the landing rollout/which resulted in the airplane 
veering off the runway and incurring damage.
