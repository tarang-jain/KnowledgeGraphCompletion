The pilot stated he landed on runway 9 left and taxied west on taxiway "D". As he approached 
the intersection of taxiway "D" and runway 5-23, he encountered a ground marshaller waving 2 
orange wands. The ground marshaller was standing such that the left wingtip would clear him 
by 18 inches. The marshaller, who was facing east, began waving his wands and back stepping 
to the west. As the marshaller was positioned at the airplanes 10:30 position, he, the 
marshaller, turned 180 degrees toward the west and bent down from the waist. His back was 
toward the wing and his face was down toward the pavement. The marshaller continued 
walking toward the west and turned his head to face another marshaller. The pilot turned to 
face the direction the airplane was taxing. He then heard a loud bang and the airplane rotated 
to the left about 15 degrees. He immediately countered with right rudder and turned left onto 
runway 5-23 and stopped. He looked back and saw the ground marshaller on the ground 
parallel to runway 5-23, with his head facing the approach end of runway 5.The ground 
marshaller stated N2652W approached the point he was working, runway 5-23 and taxiway 
"D". The sign on the airplane indicated the pilot was going to aircraft camping. He signaled him 
through the intersection, straight ahead. He had eye contact with the pilot and the pilot 
acknowledged his signal. The ground marshaller stated he turned 110-130 degrees to signal the 
motorcycle rider that the aircraft was going to aircraft camping. At this point, he was struck 
and became unconscious. A witness stated the airplane was moving at a normal taxi speed as it 
approached the intersection of runway 5-23 and taxiway "D". The ground marshaller made 
signal contact with the pilot and determined the pilot's destination. The marshaller made a 90-
degree turn to tell the witness, who was on a motorcycle, where to lead the airplane. The 
ground marshaller's back was to the airplanes outboard left wing. As the airplane continued 
taxiing, the left wing struck the ground marshaller in the back, knocking him forward. The left 
wing then struck the ground marshaller in the back of the head, knocking him to the ground. 
Another witness stated the marshaller read the sign on the windshield on N2652W to verify the 
airplanes destination and then flagged the airplane on by. She heard the pilot give the engine 
excess throttle and then the airplane appeared to veer to the left. The marshaller had already 
began to turn and walk away when the left wing of the airplane hit him on his right side from 
the back. He was sent tumbling across runway 5-23.

The inadequate visual lookout of the pilot and the ground marshaller resulting in the ground 
marshaller being struck by the wing of the taxiing airplane and receiving serious injury.
On April 1, 2003, about 1630 eastern standard time, a Mooney M20C, N2652W, registered to 
an individual, collided with a ground marshaller during taxi from landing at Lakeland Linder 
Regional Airport, Lakeland, Florida, while on a 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The airplane received minor 
damage and the private-rated pilot was not injured. The ground marshaller received serious 
injury. The flight originated from Sarasota, Florida, the same day, about 1545.
The pilot stated he landed on runway 9 left and taxied west on taxiway "D". As he approached
