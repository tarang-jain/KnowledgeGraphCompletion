The airplane struck power lines during the final agricultural spray application of the day.  This 
particular pass involved flying underneath power lines.  There was a backhoe parked near the 
pilot's intended flight path; as a result, he flew a higher than normal flight path.  The airplane 
impacted the lower power lines.  The pilot then flew the airplane back to his original departure 
point.
The pilot failed to maintain adequate visual lookout and did not maintain clearance from 
power lines.  The backhoe's location, which caused the pilot to alter his planned flight path, was 
a factor.
On April 1, 2003, about 1300 mountain standard time, an Ayres S2R-T34, N30913, struck 
power line wires during a low altitude aerial application pass near Avondale, Arizona.  Pierce 
Aviation was operating the airplane under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 137.  The commercial 
pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured; the airplane sustained substantial damage.  The local 
aerial application flight departed a private strip near Buckeye, Arizona, about 1230.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.  The accident occurred 
at 33 degrees 20 minutes north latitude and 112 degrees 20 minutes west longitude.
In a written statement submitted by the pilot, he reported that the purpose of the flight was to 
spray the last of seven fields.  This particular pass involved flying underneath power lines.  
There was a backhoe parked near the pilot's intended flight path; as a result, he flew a higher 
than normal flight path.  The airplane impacted the lower power lines, resulting in damage to 
the propeller, top canopy, vertical stabilizer, horizontal stabilizer, elevator, and rudder.  The 
pilot then flew the airplane back to his original departure point.
