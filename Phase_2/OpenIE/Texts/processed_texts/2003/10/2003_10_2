sputter. The airplane descended nose down behind a stand of trees and they heard a "boom". 
Several witnesses in the area telephoned the 911-operator and reported the accident. 
Examination of the wreckage on-scene found the airplane in a nose down attitude. 
Examination of the engine found one of the two sparkplugs out of its cylinder hanging by the 
sparkplug wire. During a telephone interview with the brother of the pilot he stated that about 
15 to 20 hours prior to the accident they had done some maintenance on the engine including 
changing the spark plugs. He further stated that he believes that the spark plugs were not 
tightened adequately which allowed one to "blow out causing the loss of engine power".
The loss of engine power due to improper maintenance and the pilot's failure to maintian 
airspeed during the attempted forced landing that resulted in a stall.
