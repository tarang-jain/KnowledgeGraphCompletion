The nose landing gear collapsed during a recovery from a bounced landing.  The student pilot 
reported that he was practicing landings on runway 9L, and upon touchdown during the 
second landing attempt, the airplane "bounced into the air".  The pilot stated the airplane 
settled back to the runway and the nose landing gear touched down prior to the main landing 
gear.  The pilot reported that the nose landing gear "folded and the aircraft veered to the left 
edge of the runway and then to the right[,] stopping in the middle of the runway."  The student 
pilot reported his total flight time was 179 hours, of which 52 hours were as pilot-in-command.  
The pilot had flown 22 hours during the previous 90 days and 14 hours during the previous 30 
days.  Besides the accident flight, the pilot had not flown during the previous 24 hours.  The 
local winds approximately 13 minutes prior to the accident were 060 degrees true at 10 knots 
gusting to 15 knots.  The local winds approximately 26 minutes after the accident were 120 
degrees true at 7 knots, winds direction variable between 100 and 160 degrees.
The student pilot's inadequate recovery from the bounced landing.  Factors contributing to the 
accident were the variable crosswind, the misjudged flare that resulted in the bounced landing 
and the subsequent collapse of the nose landing gear.
On September 2, 2003, at 1506 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 152, N757GL, piloted by a 
student pilot, sustained substantial damage when the nose landing gear collapsed while 
landing on runway 9L (5,000 feet by 100 feet, asphalt) at the Oakland County International 
Airport (PTK), Pontiac, Michigan.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the 
accident.  The solo-instructional flight was operating under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91 
without a flight plan.  The pilot reported no injuries.  The local flight originated from PTK at 
1320.
According to the student pilot's written statement, he was practicing landings on runway 9L, 
and upon touchdown during the second landing attempt, the airplane "bounced into the air".  
The pilot stated the airplane settled back to the runway and the nose landing gear touched 
down prior to the main landing gear.  The pilot reported that the nose landing gear "folded and 
the aircraft veered to the left edge of the runway and then to the right[,] stopping in the middle 
of the runway."
The student pilot reported his total flight time was 179 hours, of which 52 hours were as pilot-
in-command.  The pilot had flown 22 hours during the previous 90 days and 14 hours during 
the previous 30 days.  Besides the accident flight, the pilot had not flown during the previous 
24 hours.
