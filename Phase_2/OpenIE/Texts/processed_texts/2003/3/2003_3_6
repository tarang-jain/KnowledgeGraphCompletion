The airplane collided with obstacles during an aborted takeoff from a private dirt strip that was 
2,500 feet long.  During the instructional flight, the instructor and student were practicing 
touch-and-go takeoffs and landings.  On the third touch-and-go, the instructor felt that they 
did not have enough power to clear trees at the end of the runway.  He aborted the takeoff and 
the airplane went off the end of the runway and into heavy brush and small trees.  The Federal 
Aviation Administration inspector examined the engine and airframe, and noted no 
mechanical malfunctions.
the CFI's inadequate supervision and delayed decision to abort the takeoff resulted in the 
runway overrun.
On March 1, 2003, about 1100 mountain standard time, a Piper PA-18-150, N62712, collided 
with obstacles during an aborted takeoff from a private dirt strip near Chandler, Arizona.  
Chandler Air Service operated the airplane under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91.  The 
certified flight instructor (CFI) and student pilot were not injured.  The airplane was 
substantially damaged.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had 
been filed.  The instructional flight departed Chandler about 1030.
In a written statement, the CFI stated that while executing a touch-and-go, the airplane didn't 
feel like it was getting full power, and he elected to abort the takeoff.  The airplane overran the 
runway that was 2,500 feet long, and went into desert terrain, colliding with bushes and small 
trees.
Examination of the airplane by Federal Aviation Administration inspectors revealed no 
discrepancies with the airframe or the engine.
