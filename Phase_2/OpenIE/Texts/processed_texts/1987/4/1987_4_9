THE PILOT STATED THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS OPERATING NORMALLY WHEN HE 
ESTABLISHED HIMSELF ON FINAL APPROACH FOR RUNWAY 32. WINDS WERE FROM THE 
NORTHEAST AT 25 KTS, THE PILOT FURTHER STATED, SO HE ABANDONED THE 
APPROACH AND WAS IN THE PROCESS OF CIRCLING THE FIELD FOR A LANDING ON 
RUNWAY 02 WHEN THE ENGINE BEGAN LOSING POWER. ACCORDING TO A MECHANIC-
WITNESS ON THE GROUND, THE AIRCRAFT'S ENGINE 'SOUNDED BAD--LIKE A 
BLOWER FAILURE', AS IT FLEW OVER THE HANGAR WHILE CIRCLING FOR ANOTHER 
APPROACH. AT THIS POINT, THE WITNESS FURTHER STATED, THE ENGINE BEGAN 
BELCHING SMOKE AND TOTALLY LOST POWER. THE PILOT ATTEMPTED A RETURN 
TO THE FIELD BUT HE RAN OUT OF ALTITUDE--AND WAS FORCED TO LAND IN A 
FIELD ADJACENT TO THE AIRPORT. THE AIRCRAFT BOUNCED UPON TOUCHDOWN, 
THEN NOSED OVER. A POST-ACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE POWERPLANT 
REVEALED THAT A BLOWER BEARING HAD FAILED.
