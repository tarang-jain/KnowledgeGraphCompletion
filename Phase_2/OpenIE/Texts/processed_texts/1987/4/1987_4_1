THE AIRCRAFT WAS ON THE LAST LEG OF A SCHEDULED COMMUTER FLIGHT, WHEN IT 
CRASHED IN A HEAVILY WOODED AREA WHILE MAKING A VFR APPROACH TO 
MERRILL FIELD, ANCHORAGE, AK. THE CAPT AND HIS SOLE PASSENGER WERE 
KILLED IN THE CRASH WHEN THE AIRPLANE STRUCK THE GROUND UPSIDE-DOWN 
IN A NEAR VERTICAL ATTITUDE. THE AIRPLANE'S COPILOT, WHO HAD DEPLANED 
MINUTES BEFORE THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT, SAID HE DID NOT SEE THE CAPT USE THE 
AIRCRAFT'S AUXILIARY FUEL TANKS AT ANY TIME DURING THAT EVENING'S 
EARLIER FLIGHTS. THE AIRPLANE'S MAIN FUEL TANKS HOLD 100 GALLONS OF 
USEABLE FUEL; IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE AIRPLANE WOULD HAVE CONSUMED 
SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 100 GALLONS OF FUEL AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. 
AMPLE FUEL REMAINED IN THE AUXILIARY TANKS, BUT AN ENGINE RESTART 
CANNOT BE READILY ACCOMPLISHED IF THE AUXILIARY TANKS ARE NOT SELECTED 
PRIOR TO THE ENGINE'S QUITTING.
