THE PILOT RPRTD THAT AFTER THE AIRCRAFT WAS AT CRUISE FLIGHT, THERE WAS A RAPID 
LOSS OF HYDRAULIC PRESSURE. HE RETURNED TO THE DEP ARPT, BUT WAS UNABLE 
TO GET THE LEFT MAIN GEAR TO LOCK DOWN. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE LEFT MAIN 
GEAR COLLAPSED WHEN THE AIRCRAFT WAS LANDED. AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED A 
HYDRAULIC LINE IN THE LEFT WING HAD FAILED WHICH HAD ALLOWED A LOSS OF 
HYDRAULIC FLUID AND PRESSURE. ALSO, THERE WAS A STICKING PRIORITY VALVE. 
WITH THESE PROBLEMS, THE GEAR COULD NOT BE EXTENDED WITH EITHER THE 
NORMAL OR EMERG SYS.
