WHEN THE FLIGHT WAS APPROXIMATELY 15 MI WEST OF LANAI ON A CARGO FLIGHT FROM HONOLULU 
TO HILO, HI, THE PILOT OBSERVED THE FUEL GAUGES OSCILLATING ERRATICALLY 
TOWARD THE LOW SIDE. HE DIVERTED TOWARD LANAI TO REFUEL. HOWEVER, 
WHEN THE FLIGHT WAS ABT 9 MI WESTOF LANAI, THE LEFT ENG FLAMED OUT. THE PILOT 
FEATHERED THE LEFT ENG, BUT SHORTLY THEREAFTER (ABOUT 2 MI WEST OF 
LANAI), THE RIGHT ENG FLAMED OUT. WITH BOTH PROPS FEATHERED, HE ELECTED 
TO LAND ON AN UPWARD SLOPING ROAD. DURING THE LANDING ROLL, THE PLANE'S 
LEFT WING TIP STRUCK A SIGNPOST AND A DIRT BANK WHICH CAUSED THE PLANE TO 
PIVOT FURTHER LEFT AND NOSE INTO THE EMBANKMENT. NO FUEL OR FUEL LEAKAGE 
WAS FOUND DURING A POST-ACDNT EXAM. WHEN 1ST CHECKED, THE LEFT 
OUTBOARD FUEL GAUGE INDCD 70 TO 80 LBS OF FUEL REMAINING. LATER, BOTH 
LEFT FUEL GAUGES HAD ZERO READINGS. THE RGT OUTBOARD AND INBOARD FUEL 
GAUGES INDCD 25 AND 20 LBS, RESPECTIVELY.
