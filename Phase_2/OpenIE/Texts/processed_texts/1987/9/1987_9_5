THE GYROCOPTER WAS OBSERVED TO TOUCH DOWN AND BECOME AIRBORNE 
AGAIN. AFTER BECOMING AIRBORNE IT WAS OBSERVED TO PITCH DOWN, WITH THE 
MAIN ROTOR BLADES STRIKING THE GROUND IN FRONT OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE 
PILOT SAID HIS RIGHT CONTACT LENS WASBOTHERING HIM AND HE COULD NOT 
SEE THROUGH IT VERY WELL. HE STATED THAT ALTHOUGH HE THOUGHT HE WAS 
TOO HIGH AND CONSIDERED A GO-AROUND, HE ELECTED TO CONTINUE WITH THE 
LANDING BECAUSE OF THE CONTACT LENS PROBLEM. HE SAID WHEN HE TOUCHED 
DOWN HE SWERVED TO AVOID BUSHES AND A ROTOR BLADE STRUCK THE GROUND 
SEVERING THE MAST.
