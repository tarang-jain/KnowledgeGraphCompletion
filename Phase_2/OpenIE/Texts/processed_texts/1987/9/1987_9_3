DURING AN AERIAL APPLICATION FLIGHT, THE PILOT MADE A TURN-AROUND AND WAS 
STARTING TO MAKE ANOTHER SWATH RUN WHEN HE HEARD A LOUD 'BANG' AND THEN 
THE HELICOPTER COLLIDED WITH TERRAIN. AN INSPN OF THE MAIN ROTOR HEAD AND 
PIN REVEALED THE HUB HAD FAILED FROM HI CYCLE FATIGUE. THE FATIGUE 
ORIGINATED FROM A POINT IN THE HUB PIN BORE WHERE INTERGRANULAR 
CORROSION HAD OCCURRED.
