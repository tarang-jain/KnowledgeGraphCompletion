SMOKE DETECTED IN THE CABIN RESULTED IN AN EVACUATION OF THE AIRCRAFT 
JUST AFTER BEING PUSHED BACK FROM THE JET-WAY. SUBSEQUENT 
INVESTIGATION ESTABLISHED THAT A MALFUNCTIONING PACK VALVE HAD CAUSED 
THE AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM TO OVERHEAT CAUSING THE SMOKE. THE 
EMERGENCY SLIDE AT DOOR 2R INFLATED PARTIALLY INSIDE THE AIRCRAFT AND WAS 
NOT USABLE. AT THE TIME OF INITIAL INVESTIGATION THE SLIDE TRAY DOOR FROM 
2R WAS FOUND LYING ON THE FLOOR INSIDE THE AIRCRAFT. EXITS 1L, 2L, 4L, 4R AND 
FOUR OVER WING EXITS WERE USED (THE CAPT HAD LOWERED THE FLAPS TO FULL 
DOWN FOR THE EVACUATION). IT WAS DETERMINED DURING INVESTIGATION THAT 
THE DOOR WAS NOT OPENED FULLY ENOUGH FOR EXIT 2R TO OPERATE PROPERLY. 
UAL MODIFIED THE TRAINING TO EMPHASIZE THE DOOR OPENING PROCEDURE. 
THE FA SAID SHE PULLED THE (MANUAL INFLATION) HANDLE ON 2R.
