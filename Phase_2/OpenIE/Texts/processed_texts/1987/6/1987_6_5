AS THE STUDENT PILOT WAS MAKING A X-WIND TAKEOFF ON A DUAL INSTRUCTIONAL 
FLIGHT, THE INSTRUCTOR (CFI) REDUCED THE POWER AT ABOUT 15 FEET AGL TO 
SIMULATE AN ENG FAILURE. THE STUDENT REACTED BY RAISING THE NOSE OF THE 
AIRCRAFT, BUT THE INSTRUCTOR CORRECTED THIS BY LOWERING THE NOSE. HOWEVER, 
DRG THE ABORTED TAKEOFF, THE STUDENT TURNED THE AIRCRAFT INTO THE X-WIND. 
SUBSEQUENTLY, IT VEERED OFF THE RGT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY AND STRUCK A RUNWAY LIGHT.
