DURING LANDING ROLL-OUT THE LEFT MAIN AND NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED. THE 
PILOT STATED IN HIS REPORT THAT HE DOES NOT RECALL TOUCHING ANY 
SWITCHES ON ROLL-OUT. HOWEVER, UPON EXITING THE AIRCRAFT, THE PILOT 
REPORTED THAT THE LANDING GEAR RELAY WAS TRIPPED OPEN AND THE FLAPS 
HAD BEEN RETRACTED. INSPECTION OF THE LANDING GEAR AFTER THE ACCIDENT 
DID NOT REVEAL ANY MECHANICAL FAILURE OF THE GEAR OR ITS COMPONENTS.
