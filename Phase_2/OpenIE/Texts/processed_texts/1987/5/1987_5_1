THE TWO AIRCRAFT, A CESSNA 340A AND A NORTH AMERICAN SNJ-4, COLLIDED IN FLIGHT AT 
APPROXIMATELY 3000 FEET MSL OVER ORLANDO, FL IN VMC WITH A VISIBILITY OF 7 MILES. BOTH 
AIRCRAFT WERE IN CONTACT WITH AND BEING RADAR VECTORED BY ORLANDO 
APPROACH CONTROL. THE C-340 WAS IN LEVEL FLIGHT AND THE SNJ WAS COMPLETING 
A RIGHT TURN AND STILL DESCENDING TO 1500 FEET WHEN THE COLLISION 
OCCURRED. BOTH AIRCRAFT WERE OPERATING UNDER IFR FLIGHT RULES WITH THE C-340 
BEING VECTORED TO RUNWAY 18R AT ORLANDO INTERNATIONALARPT (MCO) AND THE 
SNJ BEING DIRECTED TO ORLANDO EXECUTIVE ARPT (ORL). THE ACCIDENT 
OCCURRED 7 MILES NW OF ORL IN THE MCO ARPT RADAR SERVICE OUTER AREA. 
DURING THE VECTORING, THERE WAS A LACK OF COORDINATION BETWEEN 
CONTROLLERS DURING A TRANSFER OF CONTROL. THE RECEIVING CONTROLLER 
FAILED TO MAINTAIN RADAR TARGET IDENTIFICATION. THERE WAS ALSO A LACK OF 
TRAFFIC ADVISORIES. THE AIRCRAFT PILOTS WERE LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO SEE DUE 
TO AIRCRAFT STRUCTURE AND RELATIVE POSITIONS TO EACH OTHER. AFTER THE 
COLLISION, BOTH AIRCRAFT CRASHED IN UNCONTROLLED DESCENT.
