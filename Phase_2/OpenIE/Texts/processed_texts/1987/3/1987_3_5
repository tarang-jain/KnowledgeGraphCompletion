THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE PREFLIGHT ENG RUN-UP WAS SATISFACTORY. 
SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF, THE ENG FAULTERED BRIEFLY AND THE PILOT ATTEMPTED 
A LANDING BACK ON THE RUNWAY. UPON ESTABLISHING A POINT TO LAND, THE ENG 
RESPONDED AND THE AIRCRAFT OVERSHOT THE INTENDED LANDING AREA. THE ENG 
FAULTERED ONCE AGAIN AND THE PILOT WAS ABLE TO MAKE A FORCED LANDING IN 
AN OPEN FIELD JUST OFF THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY. INSPECTION OF THE 
ENG AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO DUPLICATE THE ENG MALFUNCTION FAILED TO 
PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT WOULD CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINE WHAT CAUSED THE 
FAILURE.
