THE AIRCRAFT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED WHEN THE LEFT WING STRUCK A 4 INCH 
DIAMETER POST ON LANDING. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE DECIDED THAT DUE TO A 
CROSSWIND, HE WOULD LAND DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE NORTH/SOUTH RUNWAY THAT 
WAS MOWED IN THE MIDDLE OF A LARGE OPEN FIELD WHICH SERVED AS A 
GLIDERPORT. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE MOWED STRIP, THE REST OF THE 
FIELD WAS COVERED WITH HIGH WEEDS THAT OBSTRUCTED THE POST FROM THE 
PILOT'S VISION.
