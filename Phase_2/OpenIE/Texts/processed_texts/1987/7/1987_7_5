BFR DEPARTING ON A NGT FLIGHT, THE AIRCRAFT WAS LOADED UNTIL IT WAS AT OR NEAR 
ITS MAX GROSS WT LIMIT. THE PILOT STATED THAT AS HE WAS TAKING OFF ON A 3000' 
RUNWAY, THE ENG 'COUGHED' AFTER THE AIRCRAFT HAD ACCELERATED TO ABOUT THE 
ROTATION SPEED AND WAS APPROXIMATELY 3/4 OF THE WAY DOWN THE RUNWAY. HE ELECTED TO 
ABORT THE TAKEOFF, BUT WAS UNABLE TO STOP ON THE REMAINING RUNWAY. BFR 
STOPPING, THE AIRCRAFT WENT DOWN AN EMBANKMENT AND THE NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED. 
AN EXAM AND AN OPNL CHECK OF THE ENG REVEALED NO PRE-ACDNT PART FAILURE 
OR MALFUNCTION, EXCEPT FOR A RICH IDLE MIXTURE. ABOUT 19 MI NW AT 
GREENSBORO, NC, THE WX WAS: 7000 FEET BRKN, 15 MI VIS, WIND FROM 200 DEG AT 7 
KTS, TEMP 74, DEW POINT 70, ALTIMETER SETTING 30.03' HG. ACCORDING TO THE 
AIRCRAFT OPERATOR'S MANUAL, 840' OF PAVED RUNWAY WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO 
STOP. SKID MARKS WERE FOUND ON THE LAST 500' OF THE RUNWAY AND ACROSS 250' OF 
SOD BEFORE THE AIRCRAFT WENT OFF THE EMBANKMENT.
