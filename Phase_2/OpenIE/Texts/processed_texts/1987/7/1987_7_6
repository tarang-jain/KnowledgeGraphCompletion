THE AIRCRAFT HAD TO TAKE OFF EASTBOUND DUE TO OBSTRUCTIONS AT THE WEST 
END OF THE STRIP. THE SIX TO EIGHT KNOT WIND WAS VARIABLE FROM A RIGHT 
CROSSWIND TO A SLIGHT TAILWIND. INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE AIRCRAFT'S 
WEIGHT EXCEEDED THAT ESTABLISHED BY THE MANUFACTURER. LIFTOFF WAS 
ACHIEVED BUT THE AIRCRAFT STARTED SETTLING AS SOON AS IT CLIMBED OUT OF 
GROUND EFFECT. THE DESCENT WAS ARRESTED BUT CLIMB COULD NOT BE RE-
ESTABLISHED BEFORE THE AIRCRAFT CONTACTED HIGH VEGETATION BEYOND THE 
END OF THE RUNWAY AND DESCENDED TO THE GROUND. TOUCHDOWN WAS ON 
ROUGH TERRAIN. A COMBINATION OF HIGH VEGETATION AND ROUGH TERRAIN 
CAUSED THE AIRCRAFT TO NOSE DOWN BEFORE IT STOPPED.
