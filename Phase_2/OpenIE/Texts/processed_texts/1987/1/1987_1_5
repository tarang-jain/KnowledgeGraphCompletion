THE CESSNA 180 MADE A TOUCH AND GO ON A 2100 FEET LONG RUNWAY. THE 
TOUCHDOWN WAS DESCRIBED AS PAST THE FIRST THIRD OF THE RUNWAY. THERE 
WERE TWO RATED PILOTS AND A PASSENGER IN THE AIRCRAFT. THE CO-PILOT 
THOUGHT THE AIRCRAFT WOULD BE UNABLE TO CLEAR POWERLINES AT THE 
DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY AND PULLED THE POWER OFF. THE AIRCRAFT 
WAS UNABLE TO STOP ON THE REMAINING RUNWAY, RAN OFF THE END OF THE 
RUNWAY, STRIKING SOME ROCKS AND FLIPPED OVER.
