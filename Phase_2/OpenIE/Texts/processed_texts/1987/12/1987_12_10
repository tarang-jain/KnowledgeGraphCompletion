DURING THE APPROACH TO LANDING THE NUMBER SIX LEADING EDGE SLAT 
ASSEMBLY FAILED. THE INBOARD SECTION OF THE SLAT HUNG DOWN AND BENT 
AFT. THE PILOT LANDED THE AIRCRAFT WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. METALLURGICAL 
ANALYSIS OF COMPONENTS REVEALED THAT A SLAT TRACK ROLLER BEARING 
CONTAINED EVIDENCE OF CORROSION AND SPALLING. ADDITIONALLY, THE SLAT 
TRACK BEARING BOLT THAT HAD BEEN INSTALLED THROUGH THE ABOVE 
MENTIONED BEARING HAD HEAVY CIRCUMFERENTIAL GOUGES CONTAINED IN THE 
SURFACE OF A CROSS-DRILLED HOLE AT THE AREAS OF FATIGUE INITIATION. THERE 
WAS ALSO EVIDENCE OF TEARING, TYPICAL OF DAMAGE PRODUCED DURING 
DRILLING WITH A DULL DRILL BIT. THE AIRPLANE HAD COMPLETED A MAJOR 
STRUCTURAL MAINTENANCE CHECK 48 FLIGHT HOURS AND 28 CYCLES PRIOR TO 
THE INCIDENT.
