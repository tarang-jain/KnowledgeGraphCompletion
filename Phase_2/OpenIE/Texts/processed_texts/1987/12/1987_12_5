ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, THE ENGINE STARTED RUNNING ROUGH DURING 
CRUISE FLIGHT. HE ELECTED TO MAKE A FORCED LANDING AND INTENTIONALLY 
STALLED THE AIRCRAFT INTO SOME TREES TO CUSHION THE IMPACT, 
SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGING THE AIRCRAFT. THE PILOT FURTHER STATED THAT THE 
ROUGH RUNNING ENGINE WAS DUE TO FUEL STARVATION.
