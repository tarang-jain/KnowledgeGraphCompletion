THE INSTRUCTOR (CFI) SAID THAT SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF, THE STUDENT WAS 
GIVEN A SIMULATED POWER FAILURE. AT APPROXIMATELY 75' AGL, THE STUDENT INITIATED A 
STEEP TURN TO HEAD INTO THE WIND, WHICH TERMINATED IN NEARLY A 90 DEG 
HEADING CHANGE. THE CFI STATED THE WIND WAS NOT COMING FROM THE 
DIRECTION THE STUDENT HAD TURNED, AND THAT AFTER THE TURN, THE OPTION TO 
GO AROUNDOR LAND ON THE LONGEST PART OF THE LAKE WAS NO LONGER 
POSSIBLE. ALSO, THE CFI SAID HE LOWERED THE AIRCRAFT'S NOSE AND APPLIED FULL 
POWER TO AVOID A STALL, BUT THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT ALTITUDE TO RECOVER 
AIRSPEED. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE AIRCRAFT IMPACTED THE WATER IN A WINGS 
LEVEL ATTITUDE AND WAS DAMAGED.
