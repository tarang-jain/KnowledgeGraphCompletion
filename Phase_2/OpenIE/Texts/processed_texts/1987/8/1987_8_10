THE PILOT STATED THAT HE TOUCHED DOWN NEAR THE END OF THE 22OO FOOT 
RUNWAY. HOWEVER, WITNESSES SAID HE LANDED SO FAR DOWN THE RUNWAY 
THAT THEY DID NOT BELIEVE HE COULD STOP ON THE RUNWAY. THE PILOT 
DELAYED HIS GO AROUND ATTEMPT TO THE POINT WHERE IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE 
TO ACCELERATE TO A SAFE FLYING SPEED BEFORE LIFTOFF. A LOSS OF CONTROL 
OCCURED AFTER THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH THE STATIC LINE ABOVE HIGH 
TENSION LINES WHILE THE PILOT WAS ATTEMPTING TO GAIN AIRSPEED WITH THE 
STALL WARNING HORN SOUNDING.
