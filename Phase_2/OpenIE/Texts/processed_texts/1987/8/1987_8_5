THE PILOT AND HIS PILOT-RATED WIFE (FLYING IN THEIR LUSCOMBE) AND ANOTHER COUPLE 
(IN A RENTED MOONEY) HAD DINNER AND DRANK WINE. BY ABOUT 0015 THE COUPLES 
HAD TAKEN OFF IN THEIR RESPECTIVE AIRCRAFT FOR A RETURN FLIGHT HOME AND THEY 
HAD EACH OTHER IN SIGHT. THE COUPLE IN THE MOONEY STATED THAT WHILE 
CRUISING AT 6,500 FEET MSL (AND ON A FEDERAL AIRWAY) THE PILOT IN THE LUSCOMBE 
TRANSMITTED 'I'LL SHOW YOU SOMETHING. I'M GOING TO DO A VERTICAL 360. 
WAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLH THIS.' THE MOONEY PILOT OBSERVED THE LUSCOMBE DESCEND SLIGHTLY AND 
THEN COMMENCE A CLIMB. THEREAFTER, CONTACT WAS LOST. THE LUSCOMBE 
WRECKAGE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND IN NUMEROUS PIECES DISTRIBUTED OVER 
3/4-MI. EXAM OF THE AIRCRAFT STRUCTURE INCLUDING WING SPARS REVEALED SEVERE 
CORROSION. NO EVIDENCE OF THE AIRCRAFT HAVING A CURRENT ANNUAL INSPECTION 
WAS FOUND. TOXICOLOGICAL TESTS REVEALED ETHANOL LEVELS OF .02 PERCENT 
AND .08 PERCENT FOR THE PILOT AND HIS WIFE RESPECTIVELY.
