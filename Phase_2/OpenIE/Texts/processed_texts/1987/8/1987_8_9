BEFORE FLYING SOLO, THE STUDENT PILOT AND HIS INSTRUCTOR (CFI) PRACTICED 
AUTOROTATIONS FOR ABOUT 1/2 HR. THE CFI DEPLANED AND THE STUDENT TOOK OFF 
ON A SOLO FLIGHT. HE FLEW TO A RESERVOIR AREA FOR MORE PRACTICE. AFTER 
DESCENDING FROM ABOUT 1000' TO 500', THE ENG LOST POWER. THE STUDENT 
MADE AN AUTOROTATION TO THE AN OPEN AREA NEAR THE RESERVOIR. HOWEVER, 
DURING TOUCHDOWN ON SLOPING TERRAIN, THE HELICOPTER ROLLED OVER. A 
POST-ACDNT EXAM WAS MADE, BUT NO ENG OR FUEL SYSTEM DISCREPANCIES 
WERE FOUND.
