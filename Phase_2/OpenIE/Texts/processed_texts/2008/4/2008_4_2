The pilot was landing a tailwheel and tundra tire-equipped airplane on an ice-covered lake. 
During the landing roll, the main landing gear tires encountered an area of water, which 
rapidly slowed the airplane, resulting in a loss of control and a nose over. The airplane received 
structural damage to the wings, wing lift struts, and the vertical stabilizer.
The pilot's selection of unsuitable terrain for landing, which resulted in a nose over. A factor 
contributing to the accident was water on the surface of the ice-covered lake.
On April 1, 2008, about 0900 Alaska daylight time, a tailwheel and tundra tire-equipped Piper 
PA-22 airplane, N5840Z, sustained substantial damage when it nosed over during the landing 
roll at a remote, ice-covered lake, about 15 miles northeast of Ugashik, Alaska. The airplane 
was operated by the pilot as a visual flight rules (VFR) local area personal flight under Title 14, 
CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred. The airline transport certificated pilot, the sole 
occupant, was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was 
filed. The flight originated at the Ugashik Airport, about 0830.
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, Anchorage Flight Standards District Office 
(FSDO), Anchorage, Alaska, reported that he received a telephone call from the pilot. The pilot 
told the inspector that during the landing roll on the lake, the main landing gear tires 
encountered an area of water, and the airplane nosed over. The airplane received structural 
damage to the wings, wing lift struts, and the vertical stabilizer.
