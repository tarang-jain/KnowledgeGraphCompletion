The amateur-built airplane was substantially damaged during a forced landing during landing 
approach. The pilot reported that as he circled the airport, the engine speed went to 6,000 
RPM.  He stated that he pulled the power back, lowered the landing gear and increased the 
propeller pitch.  He said that the airplane began to stall and he could not maintain altitude. He 
executed a forced landing to a wetland.  The right wing struck the water and broke off spinning 
the airplane around. Subsequent examination of the controllable pitch propeller revealed that a 
jack screw pin had sheared allowing the prop to go to a fine pitch setting.  One of the blade 
pitch stops also broke resulting in the blade moving into a reverse pitch position.
The failure of the propeller pitch control mechanism during approach.  Contributing to the 
accident were the inability of the pilot to maintain airspeed and altitude, and the unsuitable 
terrain.
