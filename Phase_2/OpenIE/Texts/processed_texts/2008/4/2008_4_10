According to the operator's director of operations, maintenance personnel discovered damage 
to the twin-engine turboprop airplane during a routine, daily inspection.  A review of the 
airplane flight logs revealed that the airplane's damage most likely occurred as the result of a 
hard landing event during the last flight, earlier that day. The airplane sustained structural 
damage to the wings and fuselage.  Neither of the two pilots reported any preaccident 
mechanical problems with the airplane, nor did they report any hard landing event.
