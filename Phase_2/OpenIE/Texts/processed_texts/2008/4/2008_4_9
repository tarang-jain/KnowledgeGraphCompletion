The pilot was landing the tailwheel equipped airplane in a crosswind on runway 20 and 
reported that during the landing roll, "...a sudden gust from the west lifted the right wing and 
landing gear." As the pilot attempted to correct the situation, the airplane's left main landing 
gear strut collapsed, and the left wing struck the runway surface. The airplane received 
structural damage to left wing and fuselage. The wind at the time of the accident was from 110 
degrees at 10 knots. No mechanical malfunctions were reported.
The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions during landing.  A gusting crosswind 
was a contributing factor.
