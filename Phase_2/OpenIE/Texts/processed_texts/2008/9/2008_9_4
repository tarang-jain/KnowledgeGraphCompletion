The commercial pilot stated that, on landing, he overflew the airport and, based on his 
observations, he anticipated ground turbulence.  During the landing roll he encountered a gust 
of wind and lost control of the airplane.  The plane departed the runway and fell off a 2-foot 
drop.  Examination of the airplane revealed the left wing spar and left elevator were bent.
The pilot failed to maintain directional control during landing.  Contributing to the accident 
were the crosswinds and the rough terrain near the runway.
