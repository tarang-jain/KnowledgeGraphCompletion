On final approach to land, the twin-jet airplane encountered an increasing headwind 
accompanied by a "Caution Wind shear" audio alert, while approximately 50 feet above ground 
level.  The airplane landed hard and bounced several times before departing the left side of the 
runway.  The airplane came to rest in an upright position and the pilot and copilot were able to 
exit unassisted. The forward pressure bulkhead, fuselage, and left aileron sustained structural 
damage during the accident.  In addition, the nose wheel assembly was found separated from 
the fuselage.  An examination of the nose wheel assembly revealed that the fracture was 
consistent with an overload failure.  No anomalies were reported with the airplane's flight 
controls or engines.
The pilot's failure to maintain control during landing.  A factor was the reported wind shear.
