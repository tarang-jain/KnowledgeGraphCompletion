The pilot stated that prior to landing he believed that he had a quartering head wind between 6 
and 8 knots. Once over runway 14 at 10 feet agl, "suddenly the wind shifted and we were lifted 
up and keeled over to the right. Once I leveled the wings I realized that we were quickly 
running out of runway." The pilot stated that he attempted a go-around; he put in full power 
and raised the flaps to 20 degrees. However, he did not have enough power or clearance to stay 
out of the trees. The pilot banked left to avoid the trees and "dropped" the airplane in a field 
between houses. The airplane hit the ground and then skidded to a stop into a tree. The
