The pilot completed an uneventful normal landing after an approximate 45 minute instrument 
flight rules cross country flight.  While making a right turn to clear the runway the left main 
landing gear collapsed.  An on scene investigation was conducted by a Federal Aviation 
Administration Air Safety Inspector and it was determined that the damage to the landing gear 
and supporting structure was minor.   There was minimal surface damage to the wings and 
flight control surfaces.  Tire skid marks that matched the width of the main gear and followed 
the path of the airplane was consistent with initiating a turn at high speed.  The pilot and his 
three passengers were not injured and exited the airplane unassisted.
The pilot's excessive speed during a turn off the active runway to the taxiway which exceeded 
the lateral limits of the supporting landing gear structure resulting in the collapse of the left 
main gear.
