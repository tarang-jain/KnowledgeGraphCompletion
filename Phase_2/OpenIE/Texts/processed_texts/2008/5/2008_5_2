This was the certificated flight instructor's (CFI) first instructional flight with this new primary 
student. They did a preflight inspection of the helicopter together, and departed for the 
practice area. Once the student had a general understanding of the controls, they did an 
approach to a point on the ground that terminated in a hover.  The CFI was letting the student 
manipulate the controls more and more during the hover.  The CFI positioned the helicopter 
for a slight right quartering headwind to compensate for translating tendencies.  During hover, 
the helicopter exhibited a pendulum oscillation that is common for new students learning to 
hover.  During one of the right lateral oscillations, the helicopter unexpectedly lost altitude.  
The right skid contacted the ground, and the helicopter rolled onto its right side.  Within 
seconds, it caught on fire.  Both pilots exited immediately.  The CFI stated that the airplane and 
engine had no mechanical failures or malfunctions during the flight.
The instructor's inadequate supervision and delayed remedial action that resulted in ground 
contact and a rollover.
