The pilot reported that during takeoff initial climb, a large bird impacted the leading edge of 
the left wing slightly outboard of the fuel tank.  The airplane immediately yawed and banked to 
left.  The pilot attempted to straighten the airplane and land, however, despite his control 
inputs, the airplane continued to roll to the left.  Subsequently, the left wing struck the ground 
and the airplane cart wheeled.  Examination of the airplane revealed structural damage to the 
outboard sections of both wings and empennage.  No mechanical anomalies were reported with 
the engine or airframe.  A large deceased goose was found in the debris field following the 
accident.
