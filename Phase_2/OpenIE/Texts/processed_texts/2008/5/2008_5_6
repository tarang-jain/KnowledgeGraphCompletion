The pilot was in the process of lowering the tail to the ground after touchdown when the 
airplane veered to the right. Adding left rudder to counter the yaw was unsuccessful, and the 
airplane veered off the right side of the runway and nosed over.  The pilot reported "...close to 
touchdown I was getting bumped from side to side from crosswind gusts."  The pilot said there 
were no mechanical malfunctions or failures.
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the crosswind gusts and failure to maintain 
directional control during the landing rollout.
