During an annual helicopter proficiency evaluation flight, the flight instructor told the 
commercial pilot to conduct manual governor operations and the flight instructor then 
positioned the governor switch from "auto"  to "man" while on the downwind leg to the 
runway.  After performing a left 360-degree turn, the commercial pilot initiated a normal 
approach to the runway with the intention of performing a run-on landing.  The commercial 
pilot stated that as the helicopter descended through 20 feet above ground level (agl), he 
attempted to increase throttle and collective to arrest the rate of descent when it "felt like the 
bottom fell out" and the helicopter landed hard on the asphalt runway surface in a slight nose 
high attitude.  The flight instructor reported that he heard the aural low rotor RPM horn sound 
and noticed the rotor RPM was slowing through 350 rpm as the helicopter was descending 
through about 20 feet agl.  The instructor stated that before he could react to correct the 
situation the helicopter struck the ground.  Examination of the helicopter by a Federal Aviation 
Administration inspector revealed that the tail boom was partially bent and one of the main 
rotor blades was damaged.  No preimpact mechanical anomalies with the helicopter were 
reported by either pilot.
The pilot's failure to maintain main rotor rpm, which resulted in a hard landing. Contributing 
to the accident were the flight instructor's delayed remedial action and inadequate supervision 
of the flight.
On October 1, 2008, about 1840 Pacific daylight time, a Eurocopter AS350 B3 helicopter, 
N172AE, was substantially damaged during a hard landing at the Blaine Municipal Airport, 
Blaine, Washington.  The helicopter was registered to the US Department of Homeland 
Security and operated by the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as a Public Use flight.  The 
commercial pilot and flight instructor were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the local training flight.  The flight originated from 
Bellingham, Washington at 1815.
In written statements provided by the CBP, the pilot and flight instructor reported that they 
were conducting a series of practice emergency procedures during an annual proficiency 
evaluation flight.  After the completion of two landings, the instructor announced that they 
were going to conduct manual governor operations and positioned the governor switch from 
"auto" to "man" while on the downwind leg to runway 32.  After performing a left 360-degree 
turn, the pilot initiated an approach to the runway with the intention of performing a slide-on 
landing.  While on final approach to the runway, the pilot stated he felt like he was slightly high 
and increased the rate of descent "to intercept a flatter approach profile."
At an altitude of about 80 feet above ground level (agl), the pilot increased throttle and slightly 
raised the collective to maintain a "flatter approach profile."  Shortly after, he noticed the rotor 
rpm (NR) starting to slowly decay below the green arc and applied throttle.  While NR 
continued to decay, the low rotor RPM warning horn sounded as NR approached 360 rpm.  
The pilot continued to increase throttle as NR stabilized at 350 rpm at an altitude of about 40 
feet agl.  The pilot stated that as the helicopter descended through 20 feet agl, he attempted to 
increase throttle and collective to arrest the rate of descent when it "felt like the bottom fell 
out" and the helicopter landed hard on the asphalt runway surface in a slight nose high 
attitude.  
The flight instructor reported that he heard the aural low rotor RPM horn sound and noticed 
the rotor RPM was slowing through 350 rpm as the helicopter was descending through about 
20 feet agl.  The instructor stated that he positioned his left hand over the left collective twist 
grip, however, "before I could react to correct the situation," the helicopter struck the ground.  
The instructor added that he "believes he saw throttle twisting in the decreasing RPM 
direction" prior to him placing his hand on the twist grip.
Examination of the helicopter by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, who 
responded to the accident site, revealed that the tail boom was partially bent and one of the 
main rotor blades was damaged.  No mechanical anomalies with the helicopter were reported 
by the commercial pilot or flight instructor.
