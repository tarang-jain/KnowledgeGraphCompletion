The student pilot stated that he was established on final approach for runway 31 (4,300 feet by 
75 feet, dry asphalt) and "everything was on track."  When the airplane crossed the threshold, 
he reduced engine power and began the landing flare.  After touchdown, the student pilot 
applied the brakes, which resulted in a skid and he was unable to maintain control.  The 
airplane subsequently departed the runway pavement and came to rest in a ditch.  The left 
main landing gear collapsed.  The student pilot was performing his first landing on his initial 
solo flight at the time of the accident.  He noted that the skies were clear and the winds were 
calm.  The pilot reported that he had accumulated 13 hours total flight time, with 9 hours in the 
same make and model airplane.  A post accident inspection did not reveal any anomalies 
associated with a pre impact failure or malfunction.
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing.  A contributing factor 
was the student pilot's limited flight experience.  Additional factors were the presence of the 
ditch adjacent to the runway and the resulting collapse of the left main landing gear.
