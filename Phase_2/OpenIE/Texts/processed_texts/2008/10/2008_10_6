The commercial-certificated pilot, seated in the rear seat of a tundra-tire-equipped airplane, 
was landing on a gravel bar.  During the landing roll, the pilot applied excessive braking and 
the airplane nosed over.
The pilot's excessive application of the brakes during the landing roll, which resulted in the 
airplane nosing over.
On October 2, 2008, about 1535 Alaska daylight time, a tundra tire-equipped Piper PA-18 
airplane, N788, sustained substantial damage when it nosed over during landing on a remote 
gravel bar, about 28 miles northwest of Anchorage, Alaska. The airplane was being operated as 
a visual flight rules (VFR) local area flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the accident 
occurred. The airplane was operated by the U.S. Department of Interior, Anchorage, Alaska. 
The commercial certificated pilot, seated in the rear seat, and the airline transport pilot seated 
in the front seat, both certificated flight instructors, were not injured. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed, and a VFR flight plan was filed. The flight originated at the Lake Hood 
Airstrip, Anchorage, Alaska, about 1300.
During an interview with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-
charge (IIC), on October 6, 2008, an investigator with the Department of Interior reported that 
the airplane was being operated for pilot proficiency, and to scout landing areas for an off-
airport landing clinic. Each of the two pilots aboard planned to fly from the rear seat of the 
airplane during the clinic, and the rear seat pilot had been designated as the pilot-in-command 
for the accident flight. The rear seat pilot selected a gravel bar along the Susitna River that was 
about 2,000 feet long.  During the landing roll, he applied excessive braking, and the airplane 
nosed over.  The airplane received structural damage to the right wing lift strut and the left 
wing.
