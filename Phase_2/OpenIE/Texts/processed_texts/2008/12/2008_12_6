The pilot departed the local airport with intent of practicing traffic pattern work and basic 
flight maneuvers.  After 3 touch and go maneuvers, the pilot departed the traffic pattern and 
flew the airplane to the designated practice area.  After performing a couple 360-degrees turns 
and slow flight, the pilot attempted a power-off stall.  In order to prepare for the power-off 
stall, the pilot retarded the throttle and applied the carburetor heat.  During the recovery of the 
power-off stall, the pilot "rapidly" applied engine power, closed the carburetor heat, and the 
engine lost power.  The pilot attempted to restart the engine, however, the restart was 
unsuccessful.  The pilot elected to perform an emergency off-airport landing.  During the 
forced landing to a field, the pilot landed the airplane in a downwind direction and was high on 
the final approach.  The pilot stated that he should have slipped the airplane during the 
approach which would have allowed for "use of more of the chosen field...a longer flare and a 
lighter touchdown at a lower airspeed."  The airplane impact crops and terrain and came to rest 
on its nose.  Examination of the airplane revealed the firewall was buckled.  According to a 
designated pilot examiner, the rapid throttle application can result in engine flooding and 
subsequent engine failure.
the pilot's improper engine recovery procedures after a power-off stall which resulted in a loss 
of engine power.  Contributing factors were the pilot's improper off-field landing procedures, 
and the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.
