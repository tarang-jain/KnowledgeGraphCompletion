The tailwheel-equipped airplane was landing with a left crosswind. While rolling out, the 
airplane veered to the right and the pilot attempted to correct with aileron, rudder, and then 
brake. The pilot stated that when left braking was applied, the airplane nosed forward and the 
left wingtip and propeller contacted the ground. He stated that the airplane then nosed over. 
The pilot reported no mechanical malfunction of the airplane.
The pilot's failure to compensate for the crosswind during landing, resulting in loss of control 
of the aircraft and the subsequent nose-over of the airplane. Contributing to the accident was 
the crosswind.
