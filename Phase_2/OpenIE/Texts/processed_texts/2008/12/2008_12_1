The pilot reported that the airplane was on short final approach for landing on runway 35, 
when he experienced a "sudden loss of airspeed and rapid increase in descent rate that was not 
altered by the application of power." The airplane landed hard on the runway, all three landing 
gear collapsed, and the airplane slid off the left side of the runway. The wing spar and engine 
firewall were substantially damaged. The pilot further stated that he was flying from the right 
seat, which made referencing the instruments more difficult, and he "encountered windshear." 
The winds at an airport located 10 miles northeast of the accident airport, about the time of the 
accident, were recorded as 280 degrees at 17 knots, with gusts to 34 knots.
The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control while landing in gusty conditions.
