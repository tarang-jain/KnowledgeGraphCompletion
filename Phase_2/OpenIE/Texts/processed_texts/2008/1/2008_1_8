The pilot encountered a partial loss of engine power during flight.  The use of carburetor heat 
did not regain the lost power.  The pilot performed a precautionary landing to a grass landing 
strip he had landed at before.  The airplane nosed over in the snow upon landing.  No pre-
impact anomalies were detected.  The local temperature and dew point was -2 degrees C and -9 
degrees C respectively.  The owner's recommendation was to "replace the metal tube with scat 
tube on carb heat side."
The partial loss of engine power for undetermined reasons during cruise and the unsuitable 
terrain encountered during the precautionary landing.  A factor was the snow-covered ground.
