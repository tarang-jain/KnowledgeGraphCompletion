During landing on runway 34, a 3,313 foot-long and 75-foot wide asphalt runway, the pilot of 
the Beech A36 airplane encountered a wind gust, which he estimated to be about 40 knots.  
The airplane then bounced on the runway and the landing gear collapsed, substantially 
damaging the right wing.  The wind reported at the airport, 8 minutes after the accident, was 
from 300 degrees at 11 knots, gusting to 24 knots.
The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions.  A factor in the accident was the 
wind gust.
