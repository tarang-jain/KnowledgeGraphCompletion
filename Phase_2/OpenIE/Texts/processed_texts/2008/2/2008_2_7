The pilot reported that during the night flight, and prior to landing, he discovered that both 
landing lights were burned out.  During the landing, the nose of the right skid contacted the 
ground and the helicopter bounced back into the air and rotated to the right resulting in the tail 
rotor striking a hangar.  The helicopter rotated about 360 degrees before impacting the ground.  
The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the tail rotor gearbox attachment point.  The 
pilot reported no other abnormalities with the helicopter prior to the accident.
The pilot's misjudged landing flare, inadequate bounced landing recovery, and failure to 
maintain directional control during a bounced landing that resulted in the tail rotor blades 
colliding with a hangar. Contributing to the accident was the burned out landing lights.
