During the departure roll, as the airplane became airborne, the left main landing gear collided 
with a large rock on the left side of the pilot's private airstrip. From the cockpit the pilot 
visually confirmed that the damage seemed to be confined to the left wheel fairing, which was 
torn off, but could not discern any other damage. The airplane operated normally and the pilot 
landed without further incident. After landing, the pilot noted that the left tire was flat and the 
left main landing gear strut was damaged, including the gear box. The pilot stated that accident 
could have been prevented if he had ensured there were no rocks on the airstrip, and if he had 
maintained runway centerline. The pilot added that there were no preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures with the airframe or engine.
The pilot's failure to maintain proper runway alignment and clearance from a large rock on the 
side of the runway.  Contributing to the accident was the failure of the pilot to maintain the 
runway environment of his private strip clear of obstructions.
