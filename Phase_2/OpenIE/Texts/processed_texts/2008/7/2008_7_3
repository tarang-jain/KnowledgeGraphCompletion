The airline transport rated pilot was performing his third takeoff of the day with a full load of 
chemicals on an aerial application flight.  On initial climb the helicopter did not have sufficient 
power to maintain the climb and began to settle.  The helicopter settled into a lake in 
approximately 5 1/2 feet of water.  The helicopter remained upright and sustained substantial 
damage to the drive train and rotor system as well as extensive water damage.  The pilot, sole 
occupant, was not injured and was able to egress unassisted.  The pilot stated in the Pilot / 
Operator Accident / Incident Report that the accident could have been prevented if he would 
have paid more attention to flying the helicopter than being concerned with mixing and 
loading of chemicals.
The plot's distraction with the chemical load resulting the failure to maintain control of the 
helicopter.  A factor was no suitable terrain for landing.
