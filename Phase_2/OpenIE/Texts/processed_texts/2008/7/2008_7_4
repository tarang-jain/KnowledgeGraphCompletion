The pilot was performing an approach to the destination airport in his powered glider. The 
aircraft touched down and bounced.  It then began to veer to the right of the runway centerline. 
The aircraft then swerved to the left and the pilot could not regain control. The aircraft 
continued off the runway surface and down an embankment. The main landing gear 
encountered soft terrain and the aircraft nosed over. The pilot stated that there were no 
preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airframe or engine. He noted that 
winds were calm. When queried as to the cause of the accident, the pilot opined that the 
aircraft had "too much energy" during the landing sequence.
The pilot's improper flare, inadequate bounced landing recovery, and his failure to maintain 
directional control.
