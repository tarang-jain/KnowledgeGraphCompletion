During initial descent the pilot selected the right fuel tank for the practice instrument approach 
procedure.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time.  The pilot performed a 
procedure turn to align with the instrument approach.  The engine lost power while turning 
inbound onto the final approach course.  The airplane was at 2,300 feet mean sea level (~1,600 
feet above ground level) when the engine lost power.  The pilot switched back to the left fuel 
tank but the engine did not respond.  The pilot performed a forced landing onto Interstate 
Highway 55.  During the landing rollout the right wing impacted a mile-marker signpost.  A 
post-accident investigation showed that the left and right fuel tanks were approximately 1/8 
and 1/2 full, respectively.  No anomalies were encountered during a post accident engine test 
run.  The engine started without hesitation and responded to throttle inputs.  The engine ran 
without difficulty on each fuel tank for a period of 4 minutes, on each magneto individually, 
and with the electric fuel pump turned off.
The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.  Contributing to the accident was the 
highway signpost that the airplane impacted during the landing rollout.
