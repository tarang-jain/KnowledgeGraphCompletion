The pilot reported that he departed on an aerial application flight from the south end of a 
runway that had a hill about midway which blocked the view of the north end of the runway.  
He cleared for traffic and started his takeoff roll.  Approaching the crest of the runway he saw 
an airplane landing in front of him.  He steered his airplane into corn near the runway to avoid 
the collision.
The pilot's selection of the unsuitable terrain next to the runway to avoid the landing traffic.  
Contributing to the accident was the hill in the middle of the runway that blocked the pilot's 
view of the other traffic and the high vegetation near the runway.
