The pilot reported that during the landing he let the "nose come down and used brakes which 
caused the low clearance gear leg to dig in and begin bending."  The airplane's propeller and 
wing subsequently contacted the "undulating" grass strip.  The pilot reported no mechanical 
malfunctions with the airplane during the accident flight.  The pilot's safety recommendation 
was to replace the accident gear leg with the "new revision ... from Vans [aircraft] which has 
greater ground clearance."
The pilot's inadequate flare during landing.  Contributing to the accident was the uneven 
terrain.
