The pilot reported that he had departed the airport and had flown about 8 miles when the 
helicopter's cyclic began to shake violently during cruise flight.  When he attempted to land, he 
could not get the helicopter to hover so he attempted a run-on landing.  The pilot reported that 
the helicopter's skid caught some high grass or rough terrain and then the helicopter rolled on 
its side.  The pilot reported that the helicopter was operating normally prior to the accident.  
The inspection of the helicopter revealed no preexisting anomalies.
The airframe vibration for an undetermined reason.
On June 1, 2008, at 1330 eastern daylight time, a Bell 47D1 helicopter, N74898, sustained 
substantial damage during a forced landing to a field after it experienced a severe shaking in 
the cyclic control during cruise flight near Carrollton, Ohio.  The commercial helicopter pilot 
was not injured. The 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight departed the 
Carrollton County-Tolson Airport (TSO), Carrollton, Ohio, at 1315 en route to Wheeling, West 
Virginia.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed.    
The pilot reported he had departed TSO and had flown about 8 miles when the helicopter's 
cyclic began to shake violently.  When he attempted to land, he could not get the helicopter to 
hover so he attempted a run-on landing.  The pilot reported that the helicopter's skid caught 
some high grass or rough terrain and the helicopter rolled on its side.  The pilot reported that 
the helicopter was operating normally prior to the accident.  
The inspection of the helicopter by a helicopter mechanic revealed no preexisting anomalies.  A 
broken hydraulic hose was sent to the National Transportation Safety Board's Investigator-In-
Charge (IIC) for inspection.  The inspection of the hose revealed no pre-impact anomaly.
