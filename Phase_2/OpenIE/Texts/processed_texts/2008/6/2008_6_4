The private pilot used differential power to help land his twin engine, tailwheel-equipped 
airplane on a paved runway with a left crosswind.  During the landing roll out, when the 
tailwheel touched down on the ground, the airplane turned into the wind and departed the 
runway to the left.  It crossed over a ditch and struck a metal fence.   The airplane sustained 
structural damage to the left engine mount.  The left wing tip, left landing gear drag link, right 
vertical stabilizer and the rudder were also damaged.  The pilot stated that the accident could 
have been prevented if he had kept the tail in the air longer with more differential power 
carried into the landing roll out.  He reported that the wind was from 100 degrees at 15 knots.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing roll out.  Contributing to the 
accident was the crosswind.
