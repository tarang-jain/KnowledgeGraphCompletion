The 280-hour flight instructor was providing a 137-hour private pilot instruction in a weight-
shift experimental light sport aircraft so he could obtain a sport pilot rating.  The instructor 
said that they were both at the control bar as the pilot was practicing a normal approach to 
land.  However, when the airplane was about 50 feet above the ground, the wind started to 
push the airplane to the left of the centerline.  The pilot was unable to get the airplane back on 
course with the runway and the instructor attempted to take over the controls.  There was not a 
positive exchange of controls and the airplane drifted further to the left and rapidly approached 
power lines, buildings, and trees.  The instructor realized that they would be unable to out 
climb these obstacles and elected to fly the airplane onto the ground under the power lines.  
The airplane subsequently collided with a mailbox and a hangar resulting in substantial 
damage to the airplane's wing.  The buggy, a landing gear strut, the propeller, and windshield 
were also damaged.  The pilot reported there were no mechanical deficiencies with the airplane 
or the engine. The instructor stated that once the airplane started drifting off centerline, the 
landing should have been aborted and a go-around executed.
the pilot's failure to maintain proper runway alignment and the instructor's delayed remedial 
action to abort the landing, which resulted in a collision with a mailbox and hangar.  A factor 
was the crosswind.
