The pilot reported that the airplane entered the airport traffic pattern, and he made a visual 
approach to runway 35 with a 90 degree crosswind. He stated that he was "slow" on final, and 
when he touched down using a soft field landing procedure, the airplane was "pushed" off the 
runway by a wind gust, contacted a snow bank with the left main landing gear tire, and nosed 
over. Both wings were damaged.
The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions, and his failure to obtain/maintain 
directional control. Contributing factors were a crosswind and a snow bank.
