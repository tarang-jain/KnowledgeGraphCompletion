Upon arrival at the destination airport, the pilot noted that the windsock appeared to favor 
runway 19.  The pilot reported that the approach was made with the airplane configured in a 
slip to compensate for a crosswind.  As the airplane touched down, there was a slight bounce.  
During the landing rollout, the airplane began to veer to the right.  The pilot applied left rudder 
to correct the heading; however, the airplane continued off the runway and hit a culvert with a 
rock facing.  The left main landing gear was sheared off and the airplane came to rest inverted 
causing structural damage to the wings, the vertical stabilizer, and rudder.  According to the 
pilot's written statement, she received weather information via the National Weather Service 
and an automated report.  The winds were reported to be from 280 degrees at 4 knots.
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the crosswind condition and failure to maintain 
directional control.
