In a written statement provided to the NTSB, the pilot reported that the airplane was in cruise 
flight at approximately 3,000 feet above ground level when the oil pressure gauge began to 
fluctuate.  The pilot observed that the oil temperature and cylinder head temperature readings 
remained within the normal range.  Additionally, the pilot stated that the engine "shuddered" 
several times before he experienced a total loss of engine power.  Due to altitude and airspeed, 
the pilot reported that the only landing area available was a "soft, sandy, field."  During the 
landing roll out the left main gear and nose gear dug into the soft terrain resulting in the 
collapse of the left main and nose landing gear.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to 
the left wing.  The pilot, sole occupant of the airplane, was able to egress without assistance.
Loss of engine power for undetermined reasons. A factor was the soft terrain.
