The airplane was taxiing to a terminal gate utilizing the taxiway centerline as it passed a 
stationary airplane that had completed a "pushback" from a terminal gate.  The taxiing airline 
transport pilot perceived the distance between the two airplanes adequate to continue to the 
terminal gate, however, the left winglet from the taxiing airplane struck the right horizontal 
stabilizer of the stationary airplane. The top portion of the winglet sheared off, and imbedded 
itself in the horizontal stabilizer of the stationary airplane resulting in minor damage to both 
airplanes.
The failure of the taxiing flight crew to maintain an adequate clearance from the stationary 
airplane.
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On March 1, 2008, at 1012 central standard time, a Boeing B-737-7H4, N741SA, operated by 
Southwest Airlines Company under provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 
121 scheduled passenger service as Southwest Airlines (SWA) Flight 411, collided during taxi 
with a stationary Boeing 737-3H4, N652SW, operated by Southwest Airlines Company under 
provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121 scheduled passenger service as 
Southwest Airlines (SWA) Flight 15 during ground operations at Dallas Love Field (DAL), 
Dallas, Texas. There were no injuries to the two airline transport pilots, three flight attendants, 
and the 102 passengers onboard SWA411, or to the two airline transport pilots, three flight 
attendants, and the 132 passengers onboard SWA15. Both airplanes sustained minor damage.  
Day instrument meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules (IFR) Flight 
plan had been filed for SWA411 on the flight from the Birmingham International Airport, 
Birmingham, Alabama.  An IFR flight plan had been filed for SWA15 with the intended 
destination of William P. Hobby Airport (HOU), Houston, Texas. 
SWA411 had landed on runway 13 left and had a clearance to taxi to gate 2.   While taxiing 
southbound on taxiway D past SWA15 at gate 11, the left winglet of SWA411 collided with the 
left horizontal stabilizer of SWA15.   SWA411 immediately stopped in position on taxiway D 
and shut down both engines.
At the time of the collision SWA15 had completed a pushback from gate 11 and the ground crew 
had disconnected and left the area.  SWA15 was stationary with the parking brake set waiting 
for SWA411 to pass before beginning to taxi for takeoff.   SWA15 was on an approximate 
heading of 060 degrees with the closest part of that airplane, the left horizontal stabilizer, 
positioned approximately 20 feet away from the east edge marking for taxiway D. 
The captain of SWA411 later stated that it appeared to him that they could safely pass SWA15 
on their left. The first officer of SWA411 said he asked the captain about wing clearance as they 
approached SWA15 and the captain looked over his left shoulder and said they had enough 
room.
After initial photographs were taken SWA411 was towed to gate 2 and the passengers and crew 
deplaned normally through the jetbridge.   SWA15 was towed to gate 11 and the passengers and 
crew deplaned normally through the jetbridge.

COMMUNICATIONS AND DISPATCH INFORMATION
A review of the recorded air traffic control ground position indicated that SWA411 had been 
cleared to taxi to gate 2, SWA15 had called for pushback from gate 11 and was cleared to taxi to 
runway 13 left with an instruction to "use caution for company behind you".   
FLIGHT RECORDERS
Cockpit Voice Recorders
Both SWA411 and SWA15 were equipped with a cockpit voice recorders (CVR). The CVRs were 
secured and sent to the National Transportation Safety Board's Audio Laboratory for readout. 
The recordings consisted of excellent quality audio information.  A CVR group was not formed 
and a transcript was not prepared.
Flight Data Recorders
SWA411 was equipped with a digital flight data recorder (DFDR). The operator provided a 
readout of the DFDR data which showed the right engine had been shut down 150 seconds 
after touchdown and the maximum groundspeed during taxi was 25 knots. At the time of 
impact the recorded groundspeed was 7 knots and the airplane was on a magnetic heading of 
180 degrees. The magnetic heading did not change significantly at the time of the event. There 
was a perturbation in all three accelerometer values: vertical acceleration of 1.05G, 
Longitudinal acceleration of -0.42G (with braking), and lateral acceleration of +/- 0.05G, as 
well as application of significant braking at a recorded time of 10:13:42.
SWA15 was equipped with a digital flight data recorder (DFDR). The operator provided a 
readout of the DFDR data which showed the engines were at idle power (N1 ~ 22%), the 
parking brake was set, and the aircraft was on a magnetic heading of 60 degrees at time of the 
incident.  There was a perturbation in all three accelerometer values: vertical acceleration of 
1.04G, Longitudinal acceleration of -0.05G, and lateral acceleration of -0.18G at a recorded 
time of 10:12:33.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
SWA411, N741SA, had minor damage to left winglet when a portion of the winglet separated 
after striking the horizontal stabilizer of SWA15.  
SWA15, N652SW, had minor damage to the leading edge of the left horizontal stabilizer where 
part of the separated left winglet from SWA411 remained imbedded in the leading edge of the 
horizontal stabilizer.  The left horizontal stabilizer of SWA15 had a smear on the underside skin 
beginning at the location of the separated winglet embedded in the leading edge and 
continuing to the rear of the left elevator.  That smear measured at an angle of 56 degrees from 
the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer.  The horizontal stabilizer on SWA15 has a leading 
edge sweep of approximately 25 degrees.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Southwest Airlines Flight Operations Manual Bulletin 24-05, dated November 10, 2005
provided additional dimensional and lateral clearance information and guidance for the 737 -
700/-300/-500, and instructed pilots that "When the aircraft is not on a taxi line, a lateral 
clearance of 10 feet is considered minimum acceptable separation...   Caution:
Lateral clearance, particularly to the top of the winglet, is difficult to judge. ...  If lateral 
clearance is in question:  Stop the aircraft, and request a wing walker, request a tug, or wait for 
the other aircraft to move." 
The SWA Training Topics 2006-01, dated March 24, 2006, cautions all pilots that the winglets 
on the  -700 "changed the sight lines to the wingtip and creates a situation where the winglets 
extend beyond what is actually visible to the Pilot" and for the pilots to "never underestimate 
how difficult it is to determine clearance by looking back at the wingtip."
SWA Training Topic 1-07, dated January 31, 2007, reinforces that and adds the caution that 
from the cockpit the winglet appears to be at the edge of the position light, but is in fact 42 
inches further outboard from the apparent position of the wing tip. 
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
Southwest Airlines Company issued SWA Read Before Fly memorandum A-08-19, dated 
March 5, 2008, which informed all pilots about the incident and instructed them to use 
vigilance and caution when taxiing in congested areas and when unsure of wingtip clearance to 
stop taxiing and use a wing-walker or to wait as long as necessary for equipment or other 
aircraft to be moved. This memorandum also directed all pilots to review SWA Training Topic 
1-07. 
Southwest Airlines Company issued SWA Read Before Fly memorandum A-08-30, dated 
March 20, 2008, which informed all pilots that at DAL "effective on or about March 22, 2008, 
the red line parallel to Taxiway D and Gates 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14 will no longer define the non-
movement area. The airport is adding standard yellow markings for the non-movement area on 
that date. The DAL 10-7 is scheduled to reflect the new line in the 4 APR 08 revision. All gates 
will continue to require a pushback call as stated on DAL page 10-7. DAL ATC will now control 
clearance from Gates 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14 to the movement area. Please remain vigilant; 
perform the pushback calls and confirm ATC clearance before entering the movement area."
On March 24, 2008, the City of Dallas, Department of Aviation completed painting new yellow 
and black markings showing the new edge of the non-movement area approximately 93 feet 
from the center line of taxiway D." 
On March 25, 2008, the City of Dallas, Department of Aviation, entered into a Letter of 
Agreement with the FAA Dallas Air Traffic Control Tower (DAL ATCT) and notified the all the 
operators involved that the "city shall require all aircraft operators conducting push back 
operations at gates 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 30, 31, 32 and the Cargo Ramp to obtain approval from the 
Tower prior to moving aircraft." 
On March 25, 2008, the Dallas air traffic control tower changed their internal procedures so 
that the ground controller will no longer allow taxi operations on taxiway D at the same time 
they allow pushback operations from the affected gates.
Southwest Airlines Company framed and prominently mounted the separated top portion of 
the winglet from SWA411 on the wall of a stairway in their flight training center.  That actual 
winglet portion is now a graphical and visual reminder to all pilots of this incident.
