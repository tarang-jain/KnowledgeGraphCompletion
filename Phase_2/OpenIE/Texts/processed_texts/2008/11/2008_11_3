The student pilot was on final approach when he used rudder to correct for drift.  The airplane 
touched down while not aligned with the runway, struck the ground with its wing tip, and slid 
off of the edge of the runway.  The nose wheel collapsed when it hit a shallow ditch, and the 
airplane flipped on its back.  There was substantial damage to both wings, engine mounts, 
vertical fin and rudder, but no injuries to the solo pilot.
