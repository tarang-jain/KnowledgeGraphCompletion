The solo student pilot of the Grumman AA5B stated he was maneuvering in his local training 
area when he experienced symptoms of "vertigo." The pilot was on a westerly heading in the 
late afternoon, looking through the propeller, at the onset of the symptoms. He managed to 
navigate back to his home airport, but during the landing, lost directional control, departed the 
runway, and collided with an airport sign. The pilot was not injured, but examination of his 
medical records revealed he was treated by a physician for symptoms of vertigo in the days 
following the accident. According to the Federal Aviation Administration Airplane Flying 
Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3A), flicker vertigo is defined as: "A disorienting condition caused 
from flickering light off the blades of the propeller."
The pilot's loss of directional control during landing and while suffering symptoms of vertigo.
