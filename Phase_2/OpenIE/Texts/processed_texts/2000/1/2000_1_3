The non-instrument rated private pilot departed Montrose, Colorado, southbound in a Cessna 
421B.  According to radar data, the airplane climbed from 14,300 to 16,600 feet msl at a rate of 
1,792 fpm.  The data shows that 19 seconds later, the airplane lost 4,000 feet of altitude, or 
descended at a rate of 12,631 fpm.  The airplane then climbed back to 13,300 feet msl at a rate 
of 1,448 fpm, and then disappeared from radar.  The airplane crashed in snow covered 
mountainous terrain.  Snowmobilers, who were in the vicinity of the impact site at the time of 
the accident, said that snow showers made visibility less than 1/2 sm.  A pilot departing 
Telluride Regional Airport (located 33 nm at 045 degrees from the crash site), on a heading of 
300 degrees, at approximately 1015 said that it was clear right over Telluride.  He said that as 
he climbed out, he got into weather at 12,000 feet msl, and didn't break out until 22,000 feet 
msl.  He also said that he experienced no icing or turbulence during his climb out. 
The non-instrument rated pilot's intentional flight into IMC, and his subsequent spatial 
disorientation that resulted in an inadvertent stall.  A factor was the snow showers weather 
condition. 
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On January 2, 2000, at approximately 0950 mountain standard time, a Cessna 421B, N421CF, 
was destroyed following impact with terrain near Telluride, Colorado.  The non-instrument 
rated private pilot, the sole occupant in the airplane, was fatally injured.  The airplane was 
being operated by the pilot under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  Instrument meteorological conditions 
prevailed for the cross-country personal flight that originated from Montrose, Colorado, 
approximately 35 minutes before the accident.  The pilot had not filed a flight plan; family 
members said the pilot was en route to Las Cruces, New Mexico.
The family reported the pilot missing on January 4, and a search was commenced.  Search and 
rescue team members located the airplane at approximately 1430 on January 6.  There was 
approximately 18 to 24 inches of snow on the ground at the accident site.
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radar documented the airplane's departure from 
Montrose at approximately 0915 on January 2.  At 0946:19, the airplane began a 1,792 feet per 
minute (fpm) rate of climb from 14,300 feet msl to 16,600 feet msl.  The radar shows that 19 
seconds later, the airplane lost 4,000 feet of altitude, or 12,631 fpm rate of descent.  The 
airplane then climbed back to 13,300 feet msl at a rate of 1,448 fpm.  One more primary radar 
return was recorded at 0948:34 (no altitude was documented), and then the airplane 
disappeared from radar.  
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
The pilot's old flight logbook (his current logbook was never found) indicated that he received 
his private pilot license on March 19, 1970.  The pilot purchased N421CF in November of 1998, 
and he attended a Cessna 421B ground and flight training school, Double Eagle Aviation, 
Tucson, Arizona, in January of 1999.  On his application for the school, he reported that he had 
1,500 hours of single-engine flight time, and 1,500 hours of multiengine flight time.  
Instructors at the school reported that the pilot had good natural flying skills and was a quick 
learner.  They did report that he was "somewhat weak with instrument reference."
The pilot reported on an insurance application, on December 11, 1999, that he had 3,700 hours 
of flight experience, and 200 hours of flight experience in N421CF.  The pilot's last FAA 
medical certificate was dated March 31, 1999.  The pilot did not have an instrument rating. 
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
The airplane was a twin engine, propeller-driven, pressurized aircraft, which was 
manufactured in 1974 by Cessna Aircraft Company.  It could seat eight people.  The airplane 
was powered by two Teledyne Continental GTSIO-520-H turbocharged, six cylinder, 
reciprocating, horizontally opposed, fuel injected engines which had a maximum takeoff rating 
of 375 horsepower at sea level.  The last annual inspection was performed in Montrose, 
Colorado, on May 11, 1999.  At the time of the accident, the aircraft maintenance records and 
hour meter suggest that the airframe had accumulated approximately 3,154 hours.  
Fuel purchase records from Montrose Regional Airport indicate that N421CF received 108 
gallons of 100LL aviation fuel on December 23, 1999.  
METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS
At 0953, the weather conditions at the Cortez Municipal Airport, Cortez, Colorado (elevation 
5,914 feet), 170 degrees 22 nautical miles (nm) from the accident site, were as follows:  wind 
240 degrees at 5 knots; visibility 5 statute miles (sm) with snow showers; cloud condition 
broken 2,400 feet, overcast 3,200 feet; temperature 28 degrees Fahrenheit; dew point 28 
degrees Fahrenheit; altimeter setting 29.84 inches of mercury.
At 0953, the weather conditions at the Animas Air Park, Durango, Colorado (elevation 6,684 
feet), 110 degrees 45 nm from the accident site, were as follows: wind 110 degrees at 4 knots; 
visibility 1 sm with snow showers; cloud condition broken 800 feet, overcast 1,800 feet; 
temperature 25 degrees Fahrenheit; dew point 25 degrees Fahrenheit; altimeter setting 29.84 
inches of mercury.
Snowmobilers, who were in the vicinity of the impact site, said snow showers made visibility 
less then 1/2 sm at approximately 0950.  Telluride Regional Airport (elevation 9,078 feet), 045 
degrees at 33 nm, reported having 6 to 8 inches of snow throughout the day.  A pilot departing 
Telluride Regional Airport, on a heading of 300 degrees, at approximately 1015, said that it was 
clear right over Telluride.  He said that as he climbed out he got into weather at 12,000 feet 
mean sea level (msl), and didn't break out until 22,000 feet msl.  He also said that he 
experienced no icing or turbulence during his climb out.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The airplane crashed in rolling mountainous terrain (elevation 8,250 feet) partially covered 
with 5 to 20 foot tall trees (N37 degrees, 43.50 minutes; W108 degrees, 25.20 minutes).  
Missing branches from the trees on a ridge line (elevation 8,500 feet) overlooking the first 
impact point suggest that the airplane was approximately 30 degrees nose low and in a 25 
degrees right bank.  The missing branches on the northwest side of the ridgeline were 
longitudinally oriented 320 degrees.  
Descending down the ridgeline towards a small valley below was a scattered debris path 
comprised of components of the right outboard wing: the right wing auxiliary (inboard) fuel 
tank, a 4 foot wing spar section, the right wing aileron, and the right wing tip main fuel tank.  
As the debris path crossed the 300-foot wide meadow, its ground track changed to 334 
degrees.  At this point, the terrain began to rise, and two 4x10 foot craters were located (860 
feet from the debris field start point).  Each crater contained propeller blades (five of the six 
blades were found, the sixth was found after the snow melted in the spring).  Several small red 
plastic lens fragments were found approximately 10 to 14 feet to the right of the right hand 
crater.   
The left engine was found on the right side of the debris path, at the 990-foot point, and the 
right engine was found on the left side of the debris path, at the 1,150 foot point.  Physical 
evidence at the accident site suggested that the airplane impacted the terrain, at the 860-foot 
point, inverted.    
The fuselage and empennage were found 1,550 feet from the debris path start point.  The last 
piece of wreckage, a wheel, was found 1,600 feet from the debris path start point.  
All the major components of the airplane were accounted for at the accident site.  The flight 
control surfaces were all identified, but control cable continuity could not be established due to 
impact damage.  Both engines were severely impact damaged; neither crankshaft could be 
rotated.  There was no evidence of pre or postimpact fire.  No preimpact engine or airframe 
anomalies, which might have affected the airplane's performance, were identified.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
An autopsy was performed on the pilot by the Southwest Memorial Hospital, Cortez, Colorado, 
on January 7, 2000.
The FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed 
toxicology tests on the pilot.  According to CAMI's report (#200000009001), carbon monoxide 
and cyanide tests were not performed.  No volatiles or drugs were detected in the muscle 
samples.
ADDITIONAL DATA
The airplane, including all components and logbooks, was released to a representative of the 
owner's insurance company on August 28, 2000.
