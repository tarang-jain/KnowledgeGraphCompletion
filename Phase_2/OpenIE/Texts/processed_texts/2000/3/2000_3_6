According to witnesses at the accident site, the airplane was about 80 feet above the runway, 
on final approach to land, when it suddenly nosed into the ground. Both witnesses reported 
that the engine appeared to have been operating prior to impact. The toxicology report 
indicated that propoxyphene,  amitriptyline, and a high level of diphenhydramine were found 
in the pilot's blood. Propoxyphene is a prescription narcotic painkiller  known to impair 
cognitive performance. Amitriptyline is a sedating antidepressant.  Diphenhydramine is an 
over-the-counter sedating antihistamine.  The pilot had no current FAA medical certificate.
The pilot's impairment due to the use of unapproved medication which led to loss of control in 
flight.

On March 4, 2000, the postmortem examination on the pilot was performed at the Office of

propoxyphene, a prescription narcotic painkiller often known by the trade name Darvon, 
norpropoxyphene, a metabolite of propoxyphene, amitriptyline, a prescription antidepressant, 
its active metabolite nortriptylene, and diphenhydramine, an over-the-counter sedating 
antihistamine,  were found in the pilot's blood and urine. 
The FAA does not regulate the use of any specific prescription or over-the-counter medications 
by pilots, though the FARs do state that (Sec. 91.17): "No person may act or attempt to act as a 
crewmember of a civil aircraft ... While using any drug that affects the person's faculties in any 
way contrary to safety...." The pilot had no current FAA medical certificate. The pilot's personal 
medical history was not acquired for examination.
