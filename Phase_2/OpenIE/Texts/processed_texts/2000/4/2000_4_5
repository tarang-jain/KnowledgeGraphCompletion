The pilot decided to conduct a simulated engine failure over an agricultural field, with an 
intended recovery at '60-70 feet above the ground.'  When he was satisfied that he 'made the 
field,' a flock of geese distracted him, and the airplane struck a wire.  The pilot then returned to 
the originating airport to assess the damage to the airplane. 
The pilot's failure to maintain an adequate visual lookout, due to his distraction with a flock of 
birds.  A factor was the pilot's improper in flight decision to continue the simulated engine 
failure to too low of an altitude. 
 On April 1, 2000, about 1700 Eastern Standard Time, a Mooney M-20F, N737HB, was 
substantially damaged while practicing a simulated engine failure, near Parker, Pennsylvania.  
The certificated private pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and 
no flight plan was filed for the flight between the Clarion County Airport (AXQ), Clarion, 
Pennsylvania, and the Venango Regional Airport (FKL), Franklin, Pennsylvania.  The personal 
flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.
The pilot stated that he departed about 1600.  While en route, he decided to conduct a 
simulated engine failure over an agricultural field, with an intended recovery at "60-70 feet 
above the ground."  When the pilot was satisfied that he "made the field," a flock of geese 
distracted him and he struck a wire.  The pilot then returned to AXQ to assess the damage to 
the airplane. 
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector reported that the right wing, right aileron 
and the horizontal stabilizer were substantially damaged.
