The pilot reported he was preparing to land on runway 36 (2,200 feet by 150 feet, dry grass) 
when another airplane on the ground had its engine quit.  This airplane was stopped on the 
east edge of the 150-foot wide airstrip, approximately 1,200 feet from the approach end of the 
runway.  The pilot attempted to go around, but did not add full power.  He reported the 
airplane stalled and the left wing dropped.  The pilot reported that he added full power, 
however, the airplane impacted the terrain off the west wide of the airstrip. 
The pilot failed to add full power during a go around which resulted in descreased airspeed and 
a subsequent stall.  A factor associated with the accident was the airplane stopped on the edge 
of the airstrip. 
 On September 1, 2000, at 1600 central daylight time, a Piper PA-18-150, N82748, collided 
with the terrain following a loss of control during a go-around at Antique Field, Blakesburg, 
Iowa.  The private pilot was not injured.  The airplane was substantially damaged.  The 14 CFR 
Part 91 flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions and no flight plan was filed.  
The flight last departed Mount Pleasant, Iowa, at 1500 central daylight time.
The pilot reported he was preparing to land on runway 36 (2,200 feet by 150 feet, dry grass) 
when another airplane on the ground had its engine quit.  This airplane was stopped on the 
east edge of the airstrip, approximately 1,200 feet from the approach end of the runway.  The 
pilot reported that he "attempted a go around but did not give it full throttle."  He reported the 
airplane stalled and the left wing dropped.  The pilot reported that he added full power, 
however, the airplane impacted the terrain off the west wide of the airstrip.
