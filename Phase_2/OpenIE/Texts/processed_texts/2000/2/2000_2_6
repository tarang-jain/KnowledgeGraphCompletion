To prepare the student pilot for his first solo flight, the flight instructor retarded the throttle on 
downwind to simulate a power failure.  The instructor said the student flared the airplane high 
over the runway and added power to adjust the sink rate and banked left 'to return to the 
centerline.'  The airplane landed hard on the left main gear and bounced.  The flight instructor 
took control, aborted the landing, went around and landed uneventfully.  Postaccident 
inspection revealed wingtip, aileron, and rear spar damage. 
The student pilot's excessive remedial action (banking to realign the airplane with the runway).  
Factors were the student pilot flaring the airplane prematurely and failing to maintain 
directional control, and the flight instructor's inadequate supervision of the student. 
 On February 3, 2000, approximately 0745 mountain standard time, a Beech A36, N8240U, 
registered to and operated by San Juan Pilot Training, Inc., was substantially damaged when it 
collided with terrain during landing at Four Corners Regional Airport, Farmington, New 
Mexico.  There were no injuries to the commercial certificated flight instructor and student 
pilot.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed for the 
instructional flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  The flight originated at 
Farmington at 0730.
