While on final approach the glider experienced higher than expected sink and the glider 
impacted a fence-post short of the runway. 
the downdraft experienced during final approach and altitude/clearance from the fence post 
not being maintained by the pilot.  A factor to the accident was the fence post. 
 On July 1, 2000, at 1530 eastern daylight time, a Schleicher K8B glider, N885D, piloted by a 
student pilot, sustained substantial damage during an in-flight collision with a fence-post while 
on final approach to runway 18 (2,465 feet by 100 feet, dry/turf) at the Rossettie Airport, 
Manchester, Michigan.  Visual metrological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  
The solo flight was operating under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91 and was not on a flight 
plan.  The pilot, the sole occupant, reported no injuries.  The local flight departed the Rossettie 
Airport, at an undetermined time.
According to the student pilot's written statement, "Normal pattern approach[,] turned final 
with approx [approximately] 400 ft agl [feet above ground level], set spoilers for glide path & 
angle of descent.  Encountered heavy sink, CDIT [controlled descent into terrain]."
