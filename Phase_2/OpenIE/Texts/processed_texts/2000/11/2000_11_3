The pilot stated his landing touchdown occurred at about the mid-length of 
the runway at an excessive airspeed, and the aircraft collided with a perimeter fence at the far 
end of the airstrip. The accident events were corroborated by the written statement of an 
eyewitness, and examination of the aircraft by an FAA inspector.
A runway overrun as a result of the pilot's failure to maintain proper approach speed and 
landing touch down point.
On November 1, 2000, about 1520 eastern standard time, a Horne Bowers Flybaby, 
N4041A, registered to a private individual, operating as a Title 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight, 
crashed in the vicinity of Greer, South Carolina. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, 
and no flight plan was filed. The experimental, amateur-built airplane received substantial 
damage, and the private-rated pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured. The flight originated 
from the same airstrip about 20 minutes before the accident.
According to the pilot, his landing resulted in an extended flare that touched down at 
about the mid-length point of the 1,800-foot  runway and despite heavy braking on the grassy, 
down-sloped surface, ran off the runway end and into a fence.
According to an eyewitness to the accident, the flight's first approach resulted in a go-
around due to being too high. The second approach was too fast, resulting in a touchdown 
beyond the mid-length of the runway. The aircraft continued beyond the runway end, collided 
with a perimeter fence, and nosed over into a drainage ditch.
According to an FAA inspector, the accident occurred in the Lake Cunningham area of  
Greer, South Carolina, at a private airstrip named Flying Few Airfield. Examination of the 
aircraft revealed a broken wooden propeller, leading edge damage to the wings, and buckling of 
the fuselage behind the cockpit. The pilot stated to him that he may not have closed the throttle 
all the way on landing.
