The pilot lost directional control of the tail-wheel equipped biplane while attempting to takeoff 
from a 3,000-foot long, by 100-foot wide grass airstrip.  The 2,500-hour private pilot reported 
that during the takeoff roll from Runway 35, the vintage airplane began to drift to the left side 
of the airstrip.  The pilot added that he attempted to maintain directional control by applying 
full right rudder and aileron; however, the airplane continued to veer to the left and exiting the 
left side of the runway into soft terrain.  The airplane nosed over and came to rest in the 
inverted position.  The pilot was able to egress the airplane with the assistance of a friend.  The 
79-year old pilot reported having accumulated approximately 1,000-hours in the same make 
and model airplane.  Weather at the airport 7 minutes prior to the mishap was reported as 
winds from 085 degrees at 2 to 5 knots, visibility 10 miles with skies clear, temperature 29 
degrees Celsius, dew point 15 degrees Celsius, and altimeter 30.10 inches of Mercury.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during takeoff resuting in a nose over.  A 
contributing factor was the soft terrain.
