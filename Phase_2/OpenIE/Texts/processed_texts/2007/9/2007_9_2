The pilot reported that he normally sets the altimeter to zero prior to takeoff.  The pilot 
reported that he was distracted during the preflight and he forgot to reset the altimeter which 
was set to field elevation, approximately 1,000 feet.  This resulted in the pilot releasing from 
the tow 1,000 feet lower than what he thought he was.  The pilot stated the glider hit the tops of 
trees while on final approach.
The pilot's inattentiveness during the aircraft preflight and his failure to maintain clearance 
above the trees.
