The 1,300-hour private pilot lost directional control of the tail-wheel equipped homebuilt 
airplane during takeoff roll from Runway 16.  The pilot reported that shortly after reaching the 
first 200-feet of his takeoff roll, the airplane started to veer to the left of the centerline and 
eventually ran-off the runway.  The pilot stated the runway was elevated from the surrounding 
terrain and when the airplane ran off the left side of the runway, the airplane banked to the 
right and the right wing collided with the ground and the airplane nosed-over.  The FAA 
inspector, who responded to the site of the accident, did not find any anomalies with the flight 
controls, tailwheel steering system or the brakes.  A passenger seated on the right front seat of 
the airplane provided a copy of a short video clip confirming the sequence of events.  The 
Runway 16 was described as a 3,000 -foot long by 50-foot wide asphalt airstrip.  Weather 10 
nautical miles south of the airport was reported 10 minutes prior to the accident to be winds 
from 110 at 9 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, with a  broken layer at 7,500 feet and an 
overcast layer at 10,000-feet.  The temperature was reported as 28-degrees Celsius, with a dew 
point at 17-degrees Celsius, with an altimeter of 30.13 inches of Mercury.
The pilot's failure to compensate for the existing wind conditions.  A contributing factor was 
the prevailing crosswind.
