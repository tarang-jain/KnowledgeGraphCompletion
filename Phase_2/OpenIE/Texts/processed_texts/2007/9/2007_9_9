The pilot stated that he departed from the Okeechobee Airport and headed toward the lake to 
practice touch and go landings on the water. When he arrived at the lake, he turned into the 
wind, which caused the nose of the airplane to rise. He over corrected, causing the nose to dip 
sharply. He had his hand on the throttle. The abrupt movement made him apply full throttle 
and push the flight controls to the left, which made the airplane make a sharp left turn 
throwing him out the right side of the airplane. The airplane leveled itself off and flew about a 
mile before it came down and flipped over in the shallow water. A friend, who was flying with 
him in his own airplane, saw what had happened. The friend called for help and got the 
attention of a nearby fisherman, who came to his aid and brought him to the shore.  The pilot 
stated that there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions to the airplane or any of its 
systems prior to the accident. 
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during landing, which resulted 
in the pilot being inadvertently ejected and the airplane's impact with the water during an 
uncontrolled descent.
