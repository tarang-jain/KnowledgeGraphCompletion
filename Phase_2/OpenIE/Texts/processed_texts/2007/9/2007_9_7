The gyrocopter collided with high vegetation and rough terrain during a forced autorotation 
following the in-flight separation of a propeller blade.  The pilot reported that the muffler's 
mounting strap broke during cruise flight, which caused one composite pusher propeller blade 
to separate.  The pilot autorotated to a forced landing in a ravine.  During touchdown the 
gyrocopter rolled over upon impacting 5-foot-high bushes.
Failure of the muffler's mounting strap and subsequent loss of engine power due to propeller 
blade separation during cruise flight.  A contributing factor was the unsuitable terrain for a 
forced landing.
