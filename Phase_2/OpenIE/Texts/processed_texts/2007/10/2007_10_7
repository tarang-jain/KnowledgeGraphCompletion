The pilot of the Piper PA-28-180 had been flying for about 3 hours 35 minutes when the engine 
lost power due to fuel exhaustion, and he performed a forced landing to trees.  The airplane 
impacted 50-foot tall trees prior to striking the ground.  The pilot reported that he had topped-
off the airplane's fuel tanks, which had a total capacity of 44 gallons of usable fuel prior to the 
flight.  He leaned the fuel mixture during the flight, and expected the airplane to have an 
endurance of 4.6 hours.  Examination of the wreckage and accident site did not reveal any 
evidence that either fuel tank contained an appreciable amount of fuel at impact.  The pilot 
reported 94 hours of total flight experience; which included about 13 hours in the same make 
and model as the accident airplane.
