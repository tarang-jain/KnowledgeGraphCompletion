The private pilot, who was also the builder of the airplane, reported that his approach speed 
was too high as he was attempting to land at his 1,300-foot-long private airstrip, so he elected 
to abort the landing.  During the go-around, he applied full power and pitched the nose of the 
airplane up to establish a climb; however, the installed electronic propeller control sensed an 
over boost condition and reduced the engine power.  As result of the power reduction, there 
was not a sufficient power to maintain altitude and as the pilot was attempting to clear 
obstacles, the airplane's airspeed got too slow.  Subsequently, the airplane stalled and collided 
with trees.  The pilot further stated that he had forgotten to place the electronic propeller 
control switch in the manual mode when he applied full power, which would have prevented 
the loss of power.  The pilot was not injured and was able to egress from the airplane 
unassisted.
The pilot's inadvertent stall during a forced landing.  A contributing factor was the pilot's 
failure to place the electronic prop controller in the manual mode prior to aborting the landing 
which resulted in a loss of  engine power.
