The pilot stated he was 15 miles north of the destination airport when he was cleared for a left 
downwind landing.   He said he switched from the right fuel tank to the left fuel tank, and 
noted the right fuel tank was indicating 20 gallons.  When he selected flaps, they would not 
work.  On short final, he attempted to apply power, and noticed the engine was not producing 
power.  He switched to the right fuel tank, with no response from the engine.  He elected to 
land in a field, and made a hard landing in the grass, where the airplane nosed over.  
Postaccident examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector revealed that the left fuel tank 
had ample fuel, but the right fuel tank was empty.  The inspector stated that the accident 
airplane was out of annual inspection, and the pilot's biennial flight review was past due.
The pilot's improper fuel management during the landing approach, resulting in a loss of 
engine power due to fuel starvation, and a forced off-airport landing.
