The airplane collided with a fence during a rejected takeoff following a partial loss of engine 
power.  The pilot reported that after the airplane lifted off the ground, he retracted the landing 
gear.  Just abeam the tower, he felt a "jolt/engine burp," and noted that he was about 100 feet 
above the ground.  He reduced the power, but was not able to lower the landing gear prior to 
the airplane touching down on the remaining runway.  The airplane slid down the runway, and 
came to a stop after impacting the airport perimeter fence.  A Federal Aviation Administration 
airworthiness inspector examined the engine following the accident and noted that the number 
2 fuel injection nozzle was clogged with unidentified debris that would crumble when touched.  
Inspection of the number 2 cylinder combustion chamber revealed a white coloration on the 
cylinder walls consistent with a lean fuel condition.  No anomalies were noted with the 
remaining fuel injection nozzles and the other cylinders' combustion chambers.
contamination of the number 2 fuel injector nozzle that lead to a partial loss of engine power.
