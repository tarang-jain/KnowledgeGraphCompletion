The tail-wheel airplane was substantially damaged during landing when it departed runway 27 
(4,198 feet by 100 feet, asphalt) and nosed over.  The pilot noted that the intended destination 
was a planned fuel stop en route to his final destination.  He stated that upon "entering the 
traffic pattern, it was apparent that the winds were stronger than forecast from the south.  
Upon landing, a gust of wind struck the plane."  The airplane subsequently departed the 
runway pavement and nosed over.  Surface winds in the vicinity were reported to be from 210 
degrees at 19 knots, gusting to 30 knots.  The pilot noted that there were no malfunctions 
associated with the airplane prior to the accident.
The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions and his subsequent failure to 
maintain directional control during landing.  The crosswind and wind gusts were contributing 
factors.
