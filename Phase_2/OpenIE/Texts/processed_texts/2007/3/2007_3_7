The airplane collided with a berm during a forced landing in an industrial building 
construction site following a loss of engine power.  The pilot stated that during the preflight 
inspection he did not check the fuel quantity.  He stated that a month prior to the accident the 
airplane had been "topped off," and then flown about an hour from the right fuel tank.  The 
pilot also said that during the 160 nautical mile accident flight he did not recall switching fuel 
tanks.  About 3 miles north of the destination airport the engine sputtered and lost power.  He 
switched tanks and activated the electric fuel boost pump, the engine restarted momentarily, 
then sputtered and lost power again.  The pilot switched tanks three or four more times to no 
avail.  Post accident inspection of the airplane by the FAA revealed that the right fuel tank was 
empty and the left tank contained about 6 gallons of 100LL aviation fuel.  The fuel line to the 
carburetor did not contain any fuel.  The fuel selector valve was selected to the right tank 
position.  The electric fuel pump was activated and no fuel pressure indication was observed.  
The fuel selector handle was moved to the left fuel tank position and a fuel pressure indication 
was observed in the normal operating range.
The pilot's inadequate in-flight fuel system management, which resulted in fuel starvation and 
a loss of engine power.
