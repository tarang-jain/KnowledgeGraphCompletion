The airplane veered off the runway and collided with a ditch.  During the landing rollout, the 
airplane started to veer to the right of runway centerline.  The CFI allowed the student, who 
had a total time of 3 hours, to attempt to correct the airplane's track back to runway centerline 
until it became evident that the student was not able to do so.  The instructor then assumed 
control and tried to correct the ground track. The student kept his feet on the brakes in an 
attempt to help the instructor slow the airplane.  The airplane departed off the right side of the 
runway, and continued for about 200 feet until it impacted a ditch.  The CFI stated that the 
airplane and engine had no mechanical failures or malfunctions during the flight.
the student pilot's failure to maintain directional during the landing rollout and the certified 
flight instructor's inadequate supervision.
