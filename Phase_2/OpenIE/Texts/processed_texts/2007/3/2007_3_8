The conventional gear airplane bounced two times after touchdown and nosed over.  On the 
first bounce, the pilot added a small amount of power to allow the airplane to settle back onto 
the runway.  However, the airplane bounced again, and he added full power in an attempt to go 
around and pushed forward on the control stick.  The propeller then contacted the runway and 
the airplane nosed over.  The pilot stated that there were no mechanical failures or 
malfunctions during the flight.
The pilot's improper bounced landing recovery and improper use of the flight controls that 
resulted in a porpoise and a nose over.
