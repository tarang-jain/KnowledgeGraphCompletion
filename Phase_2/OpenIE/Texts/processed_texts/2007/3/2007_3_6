According to the pilot, he inadvertently bounced the airplane two times while performing a 
landing on runway 26. He elected to abort the landing and perform a go-around. The pilot 
stated that after the second bounce he lost his crosswind correction and the airplane departed 
the runway to the north. One of the main landing gear contacted the ground and dug in. The 
airplane rotated around 120 to 180 degrees and came to rest on its belly, resulting in 
substantial damage. An examination of the airplane's systems revealed no anomalies.
