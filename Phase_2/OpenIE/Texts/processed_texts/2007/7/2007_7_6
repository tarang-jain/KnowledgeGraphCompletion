The pilot stated that the airplane was on the glide path and approach speed was approximately 
85 knots. Several minutes prior, the manifold pressure gauge became erratic and was unable to 
be used as an accurate indication. He pushed the manifold control full forward for the 
remainder of the approach. The landing touchdown was 1/3 down the runway and seemed to 
be a "tad fast".  Halfway down the runway, he realized the engine wasn't going completely to 
idle. At about 2/3 down the runway, knowing that the airplane was too fast, he looked at the 
option of going around and ruled it out because of the slow speed and the height needed to 
clear the tree line. He attempted to slow the airplane by applying full brakes; however, was 
unable to slow down before running off the runway. The pilot stated to the NTSB investigator 
that there were no mechanical issues with the airplane and he should have initiated a go-
around. The published length of runway 18/36 at the Freeway Airport, Mitchellville, Maryland, 
is 2,420 feet by 40 feet. 
The pilot's failure to attain the proper touchdown point for landing and his failure to initiate a 
go-around when he realized the airplane would touchdown past the intended point.
