The pilot stated that the takeoff was normal.  His glider and the tow plane were on the initial 
climb out. During the climb they began to encounter heavy turbulence. At 200 feet AGL he 
continued to encounter heavy turbulence and bumped his head twice against the canopy. He 
inadvertently hit the release cable handle at a low altitude, and disconnected from the tow 
plane. He attempted to return to the airport and collided with trees after losing lift. The pilot 
did not report any flight control anomalies with the glider.
