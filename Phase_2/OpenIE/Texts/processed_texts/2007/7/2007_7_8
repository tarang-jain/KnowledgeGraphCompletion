The balloon caught fire after landing during the Battle Creek Field of Flight Hot Air Balloon 
Festival.  The pilot stated that after approximately one hour in the air, the balloon landed safely 
in a yard.  When the pilot looked up inside the top of the balloon envelope, the "parachute top 
did not reseat."  He attempted to reseat the top by using a "blast of heat" from the burners but 
it did not work.  The pilot "knew the balloon would quickly sink down on top of the basket" so 
he turned the burners to their horizontal position and prepared to push the envelope fabric 
away.  When the balloon envelope began to descend towards the ground the pilot reported that 
"we suddenly had a fire in the basket."  Both the pilot and passenger were able to exit the 
basket.  The pilot "determined the fire was coming from the burners" so he returned to the 
basket and turned off the fuel tanks.  The fire was subsequently extinguished by the passenger 
and bystanders.  An examination of the balloon after the accident revealed the fuel valve for the 
whisper burners was in the "on" position.
The whisper burner's fuel valve opening for undetermined reasons, which resulted in a fire 
after landing.  A factor in the accident was the balloon envelope's parachute top not reseating.
