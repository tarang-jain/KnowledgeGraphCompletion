The airplane was substantially damaged when it struck a ditch along the edge of the runway 
during an aborted landing. The pilot reported that there was a right 45 degree crosswind at 20 
knots which decreased just as he was touching down. The airplane then yawed to the right and 
the pilot applied power to execute an aborted landing. The airplane subsequently became 
airborne and crossed over the ditch along the right side of the runway. The airplane settled to 
the ground and the left wing tip struck the ditch edge.  The airplane subsequently spun to the 
left, the right landing gear collapsed, and the airplane slid across the runway.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing.  Contributing to the accident 
was a ditch.
On August 1, 2007, about 0915 central daylight time, an Air Tractor AT-502B, operated by 
Keller Flying Service, and piloted by a commercial pilot, sustained substantial damage during 
an aborted landing on runway 17 (4,018 feet by 75 feet), at the Hampton Municipal Airport 
(HPT), Hampton, Iowa.  The 14 CFR Part 137 aerial application flight was operating in visual 
meteorological conditions without a flight plan.  No injuries were reported.  The local flight 
originated at an unconfirmed time.
The pilot stated that while landing on runway 17 at HPT the winds were about 20 knots from 
the southwest.  He said that just as he was touching down the wind speed decreased,  which 
resulted in the airplane yawing to the right.  He said that the tires began to skip and he applied 
power to execute a go-around.  He stated that as he crossed the ditch along the right side of the 
runway the airplane settled to the ground and the left wing tip struck the ditch.  The airplane 
subsequently spun to the left, the right landing gear collapsed, and the airplane slid across the 
runway.
