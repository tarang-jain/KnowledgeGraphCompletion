According to the pilot, this was his sixth sightseeing flight of the day.  He had just landed and 
three passengers disembarked.  Three other passengers boarded the helicopter.  As the pilot 
brought the throttle to full rpm and increased torque, the helicopter turned left about 15 
degrees.  Approximately 3 inches of opposite pedal was used to bring the helicopter back to its 
original heading.  The pilot continued to increase torque and as the skids started to come off 
the ground, the nose pitched up rapidly and the helicopter rolled to the right.  The left skid was 
about 3 inches off the ground during the yaw.  The right skid never left the ground.  Full 
forward and left cyclic had no effect.  The pilot then lowered collective and tried to roll off the 
throttle.  The helicopter rolled right until the main rotor blades contacted the ground. A piece 
of main rotor blade struck a nearby hangar.  The pilot reported no control anomalies and a 
subsequent examination revealed no discrepancies.  FAA's "Rotorcraft Flying Handbook" 
(FAA-H-8083-21) defines "dynamic rollover" as "the tendency of a helicopter to continue 
rolling when the critical angle is exceeded, if one gear is on the ground, and the helicopter is 
pivoting around that point."
The pilot's failure to maintain control of the helicopter, resulting in an inadvertent dynamic 
rollover.
On August 1, 2007, approximately 1635 mountain daylight time, a Bell 206B, N268TD, piloted 
by an airline transport-certificated pilot, was substantially damaged when it yawed to the left 
and rolled over to the right and struck the helipad while taking off at Rocky Mountain 
Metropolitan Airport (BJC), Broomfield, Colorado.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed 
at the time of the accident.  The sightseeing flight was being conducted under the provisions of 
Title 14 CFR Part 91 without a flight plan.  The pilot and two passengers aboard the helicopter 
received minor injuries.  One passenger was not injured.  The local flight was originating at the 
time of the accident.

On August 15, 2007, the helicopter was examined by FAA and Bell Helicopter investigators.  
They reported finding no anomalies.
FAA's "Rotorcraft Flying Handbook" (FAA-H-8083-21) defines "dynamic rollover" as "the 
tendency of a helicopter to continue rolling when the critical angle is exceeded, if one gear is on 
the ground, and the helicopter is pivoting around that point."  It elaborates:  "A helicopter is 
susceptible to a lateral rolling tendency, called dynamic rollover, when lifting off the surface.  
For dynamic rollover to occur, some factor has to first cause the helicopter to roll or pivot 
around a skid...until its critical rollover angle is reached.  Then, beyond this point, main rotor 
thrust continues the roll and recovery is impossible.  If the critical rollover angle is exceeded, 
the helicopter rolls on its side regardless of the cyclic corrections made."
