The airplane was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain during an aborted landing 
attempt on runway 14, 3050 feet long, by 75 feet wide, dry asphalt. The pilot stated that as he 
was lowering the tailwheel to the runway, he impacted two geese.  The airplane started to "turn 
to the right" while the pilot tried to correct using left brake, left rudder, and right aileron 
control inputs.  The pilot then added full engine power "to get back in the air."  The left wing 
subsequently contacted the runway and the airplane "flipped on its back" and came to rest 
inverted.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control, which resulted in impact with terrain during 
an attempted aborted landing.  A factor in the accident was the geese impacted during the 
landing roll.
