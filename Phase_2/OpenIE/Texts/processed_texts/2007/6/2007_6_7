While executing an aborted landing, the nose wheel of the airplane snagged a barbed wire 
fence and the airplane nosed over on its back.  The pilot stated that he arrived over the 
destination airport and circled to check the grass strip for obstructions and general field 
conditions.  Satisfied with the appearance of the runway he decided to land.  Towards the end 
of the landing rollout he felt that the tires were sinking and dragging excessively.  Fearing 
getting stuck, he elected to abort the landing and continue with a takeoff.  After liftoff, the 
airplane failed to clear a barbed wire fence at the end of the runway and the nose landing gear 
tire snagged the fence and the airplane nosed over on its back.  The pilot stated that the 
airplane and engine had no mechanical failures or malfunctions during the flight.
The pilot's decision to abort the landing with insufficient runway available to gurantee 
obstruction clearance.
