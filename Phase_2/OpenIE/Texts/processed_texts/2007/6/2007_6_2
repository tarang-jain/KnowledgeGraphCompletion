While on short final approach approximately 10 feet above ground level (agl), the pilot added a 
little power to the engine and then heard a "loud pop" sound.  Subsequently, the airplane 
stalled and the left wing impacted the grass runway.  The airplane bounced, impacted trees and 
a fence, and came to rest inverted adjacent to the runway.  No anomalies were noted with the 
airframe and engine.
The pilot's failure to maintain airspeed during final approach resulting in a inadvertent stall 
and impact with terrain.
