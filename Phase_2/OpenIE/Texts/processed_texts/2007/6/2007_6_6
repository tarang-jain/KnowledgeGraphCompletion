While on downwind the airplane experienced a loss of engine power and collided with houses 
and other obstacles during a forced landing on a residential neighborhood street.  The pilot 
stated that he took off to troubleshoot a landing gear anomaly.  He departed the airport area to 
the south.  He cycled the landing gear and upon getting questionable indications in the cockpit 
of gear position he requested another aircraft confirm his landing gear configuration.  Once he 
got the confirmation that all three wheels were down he proceeded back to the airport.  About 2 
miles away and approximately 1,800 feet agl the right engine began to lose power.  He 
troubleshot the engine by attempting a restart, cycling the fuel pump off then on, and selected 
the right auxiliary fuel tank.  The right engine did regain some power.  He had lost some 
altitude during the process of troubleshooting the engine.  He  raised the landing gear to reduce 
drag, and entered right hand traffic for runway 17.  At this point the left engine lost power, the 
airplane turned left, and he entered a descent to help maintain airspeed. He put the left 
propeller in feather, and switched to a new fuel tank, but the engine did not regain power.  He 
did not have any altitude to exchange for airspeed and steered the airplane towards a clear 
residential street.  The airplane impacted the roofs of at least two houses before colliding with 
the street.  The pilot egressed through the rear of the airplane.  An FAA inspector that 
examined the airplane wreckage stated that there was very little evidence of fuel onboard the 
airplane.  The pilot stated that the left engine had failed due to fuel starvation and that he had 
fuel onboard but it was not in the right places.
fuel starvation due to the pilot's failure to adequately manage and monitor his fuel supply.
