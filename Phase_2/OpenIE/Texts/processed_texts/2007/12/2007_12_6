On December 2, 2007, at approximately 7:21 pm Eastern Standard time, Comair flight 5412 
(COM5412), a Bombardier Regional Jet (CRJ), departed runway 15R and over flew America 
West (AWE) flight 83, an Airbus A320, that had landed on runway 10 at 
Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI), Baltimore, Maryland 
during night visual meteorological conditions. 
Weather conditions were: wind calm, visibility 5 statute miles, light rain and mist, ceiling 1,000 
feet broken and 3,000 feet overcast.
The tower controller had cleared AWE83 to land on runway 10 and AWE83 was approximately 
6 mile on final approach when the ATC local controller cleared COM5412 for takeoff on runway 
15R. COM5412 was on taxiway A about 500 feet short of runway 15R when the takeoff 
clearance was issued. AMASS alerted. COM5412 rotated at taxiway F and over flew AWE83, at 
the intersection of runways 10 and 15R. The initial report from the Federal Aviation 
Administration stated that COM5421 over flew AWE83 by 300 feet. AWE83 exited runway 10 
at runway 22.
The probable cause of this incident is local controller's failure of maintaining awareness of the 
situation and failing to provide the appropriate separation between the two aircraft operating 
on intersecting runways.  Providing separation between aircraft is a first duty priority, in 
accordance with FAA Order 7110.65.
On December 2, 2007, at approximately 1922 Eastern Standard time (EST), Comair, Inc., flight 
5412 (COM5412),  N781CA, a Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet, departed runway 15R and 
over flew America West Airlines flight 83 (AWE 83), N659AW, an Airbus Industrie A-320, that 
had landed on runway 10, at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport 
(BWI), Baltimore, Maryland.  Both aircraft were operating as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 121 flight and both crews had filed instrument flight rules flight plans.  There were no 
injuries to the occupants of either aircraft and neither aircraft was damaged.  The incident 
occurred during night visual flight rules conditions.
About 1919:07, when AWE 83 was approximately six mile final for landing on runway 10, the 
BWI local controller cleared AWE 83 to land. The pilot of AWE 83 acknowledged the landing 
clearance.
About 1920:33, as evidenced by BWI radar data and Airport Movement Area Safety System 
(AMASS) data, AWE 83 was two and one half mile final to runway 10 when the local controller 
cleared COM5412 for takeoff on runway 15R.  At the time of the takeoff clearance, COM5412 
was situated on taxiway A about 500 feet south of the departure end of runway 15R.  The pilot 
of COM5412 acknowledged the takeoff clearance. 
 
About 1921:29, the ASDE (airport surface detection equipment) tower display showed the 
runway 10 red hold bars illuminated for AWE 83 on final approach to runway 10.
About 1921:38, the ASDE tower display showed the runway 15R red hold bars illuminated for 
COM5412 departing on runway 15R. 
About 1921:47, the ASDE tower display alerted with both visual and aural alarms.  According to 
the local controller, trom the back of the tower cab, an aural alert announced, "WARNING: 
AWE83, runways 10, 15R, converging."  The AMASS also displayed numerous visual alarms 
such as a textual warning box, red hold bars for both runways indicating restricted runway/taxi 
crossing points, and purple circles around each aircraft as they approached the intersection of 
runways 10 and 15R.  According to the local controller, he had turned his back from the runway 
operations to ask another controller to adjust the volume on the Domestic Events Network 
(DEN) line when he heard the AMASS alert.  As the local controller turned back towards the 
local control position, he looked at the ASDE display and saw the circles around the two 
targets.  After recognizing the situation, the local controller said, "Comair, Comair, cancel, 
cancel or"  According to the COM5412 pilot's statement, they were at V1/Vr speed passing 
taxiway F on runway 15R, when the local controller attempted to instruct the crew to cancel 
takeoff clearance; however, it was too late to abort the takeoff.  COM5412 crossed in front of 
AWE83, as AWE 83 proceeded through the intersection of runways 10 and 15R.  According to 
the FAA Runway Safety office, COM5412 missed AWE 83 by 400 feet laterally and 400 feet 
vertically.  The FAA Runway Safety Office classified the incident as category "B" event.  
About 1922:17, the local controller instructed AWE83 to turn left on runway 4/22, and advised 
the crew to contact ground control.  The pilot of AWE 83 acknowledged.
