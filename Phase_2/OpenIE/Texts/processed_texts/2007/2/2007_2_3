The student pilot successfully performed three autorotations to a hover; however, during the 
fourth, he "landed hard with a yaw to the left."  The flight instructor was not able to correct the 
yaw, and the helicopter impacted the ground, damaging the tail boom.  The accident was not 
reported until the flight instructor was involved in a similar accident, in the same helicopter, 
about 30 days later.  No mechanical deficiencies were reported by the flight instructor or the 
student pilot.
The student pilot's failure to maintain control of the helicopter during landing, and the flight 
instructor's delayed remedial action.
