The airplane impacted a ditch following an uncontrolled exit from the runway surface (runway 
33, 3,401 feet long, 100 foot wide, dry concrete).    The instructor reported that after 
touchdown, the power was increased but the airplane yawed into the left crosswind.  The 
airplane then exited the runway into the grass adjacent to the runway.  The instructor stated 
that the main gear dragged in the grass and the nose gear dug into the ground.  The airplane 
then pivoted to the right and the left wingtip impacted and dragged through the grass.   The 
reported wind conditions about the time of the accident were from 280 magnetic degrees at 13 
knots, gusting to 21 knots.  Inspection of the airplane did not reveal any flight control or 
mechanical malfunction that would have prevented normal operation.
The instructor's inadequate remedial action following the student pilot's loss of control during 
the crosswind landing and the instructor's failure to compensate for the wind conditions.  
Contributing factors were, the crosswind, the gusting wind conditions and the ditch.
