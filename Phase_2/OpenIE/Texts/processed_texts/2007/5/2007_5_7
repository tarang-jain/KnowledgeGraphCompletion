The student pilot stated that four full stop landings with the instructor were conducted before 
the solo endorsement was issued. After the first solo flight in the pattern, a go around was 
executed to give way for landing traffic. The second solo flight around the pattern went very 
well; final approach and landing went smoothly, and on target. During the landing roll, he 
applied brake pressure in addition to pulling back completely on the control yoke to induce 
aerodynamic braking with the elevator.  As braking was applied, the airplane began to veer to 
the right.  Full braking was applied; however, the airplane continued the right turn on to the 
grass. Attempts were made to avoid the electrical equipment boxes located in the grass. The 
airplane missed the far left two but came in contact with the far right box with the airplane's 
left main landing gear causing complete collapse. The aircraft came to rest in the field on its left 
wing. He secured the airplane and immediately exited. The student pilot stated there were no 
mechanical failures or malfunctions to the airplane or any of its systems prior to the accident.
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during landing roll.
