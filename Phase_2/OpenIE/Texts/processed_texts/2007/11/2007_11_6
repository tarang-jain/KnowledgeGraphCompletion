The pilot was returning to the airport after releasing some skydivers.  He was following a 
training airplane in the traffic pattern and was gaining on it, so he decided to extend his 
downwind leg.  On final approach to runway 08, his airplane was still gaining on the other 
airplane.  The pilot reduced power and raised the nose to reduce airspeed to 85 mph.  The 
airplane was "low and slow" as he passed over a lake, so he added power but not soon enough.  
The airplane touched down on the sandy shore of the lake short of the runway.  The nose gear 
was torn off and the airplane nosed over.
The pilot's misjudgment of altitude.  Contributing factors in this accident were the pilot's 
intentional low airspeed, his failure to execute a go-around, and the soft terrain.
