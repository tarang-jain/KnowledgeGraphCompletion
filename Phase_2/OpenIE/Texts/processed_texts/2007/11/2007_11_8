The private pilot was performing a full-stop landing on runway 17, a 60-foot wide turf runway.  
On landing roll-out, the tower controller observed the tailwheel-equipped airplane departed 
the left side of the runway, nosed over, and came to rest in the inverted position.  The winds at 
the time of the accident were from 050 degrees at 4 knots.
The pilot's failure to maintain direction control.  A contributing factor was the tailwind.
