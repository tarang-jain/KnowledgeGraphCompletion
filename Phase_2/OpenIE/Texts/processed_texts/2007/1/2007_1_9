The pilot was performing a takeoff on runway 05, a 2,200-foot long asphalt runway.   About 
three quarters down the runway, the pilot attempted to rotate the airplane, but it did not 
respond well.  The pilot then noted that the airspeed indicator appeared to indicate less than 
the 65-knot speed needed to continue with rotation.  At that time, the pilot aborted the takeoff; 
and the airplane overran the runway and strucks rocks.  Winds were reported as calm at the 
time of the accident.  The pilot also reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or 
failures with the airplane.
The pilot-in-command's delayed aborted takeoff, which resulted in a runway overrun and 
collision with terrain. A factor was the rocks off the end of the runway.
