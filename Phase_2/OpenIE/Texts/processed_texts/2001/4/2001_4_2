The initial portion of the airplane's takeoff on runway 17 was normal. The wind was from 250 
degrees at 15 knots. Just as the airplane lifted off, a crosswind blew it off the left side of the 
runway. The airplane struck a fence and nosed over. The pilot said that it was "likely that a 
wind gust in excess of the aircraft's capability was encountered."
the pilot's failure to maintain directional control during takeoff. A contributing factors was the 
gusty crosswind condition.
On April 1, 2001, approximately 1045 mountain daylight time, N679WB, a Fox Pegazair 100, 
owned and operated by the pilot was substantially damaged when it collided with terrain 
during takeoff from Angel Fire, New Mexico, Airport. The commercial pilot, the only occupant 
aboard, was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had 
been filed for the personal flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91. The flight was 
originating at the time of the accident.
In a telephone interview, the pilot said he was making a takeoff on runway 17. Just as the 
airplane lifted off, a crosswind blew it off the left side of the runway. The airplane struck a 
fence and nosed over. At the time of the accident, the wind was from 250 degrees at 15 knots.
In his accident report, the pilot said the initial portion of the takeoff was normal, but after the 
airplane had rolled 520 feet, "directional control was lost and the aircraft departed the runway 
at about a 30 degree angle." The airplane became airborne and continued 524 feet before 
crossing a small ditch and colliding with a barbed wire fence. The airplane traveled another 40 
feet before striking the ground in a right wing low attitude. The right main landing gear 
collapsed and the airplane skidded another 16 feet before nosing over. The pilot said that there 
were gusty crosswinds at the time of the accident and that is was "likely that a wind gust in 
excess of the aircraft's capability was encountered."
