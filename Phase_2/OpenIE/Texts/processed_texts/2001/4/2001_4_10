The student pilot landed hard, veered to the right of the runway, and stuck a taxiway sign with 
the lower portion of the left wing strut.  The pilot, on his fifth solo flight, had been approved by 
his flight instructor to practice landing-pattern work.  Winds at the time of the accident were 
from 160 degrees at 9 knots.
The student pilot's inadequate compensation for the exisiting crosswind and his improper 
landing flare that resulted in a hard landing, and loss of directional control during the landing 
roll.
On April 2, 2001, at 1849 hours Pacific daylight time, a Cessna 172S, N669SP, made a hard 
landing on runway 25L at the Long Beach/Daugherty Field Airport, Long Beach, California.  
The airplane sustained substantial damage after it veered off the right side of the runway and 
struck a taxiway sign with the lower portion of the left wing strut.  The airplane was operated 
by Surface to Air as an instructional flight under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91.  The student 
pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the 
local landing pattern-work flight.  No flight plan had been filed.
The Long Beach/Daugherty Field (LGB) aviation routine weather report (METAR) issued at 
1856 reported: visibility 10 miles with few clouds at 4,000 msl; wind from 160 degrees at 9 
knots; temperature 57 degrees Fahrenheit; dew point 48 degrees Fahrenheit; and altimeter 
29.85 inHg.
A Safety Board investigator interviewed the operator of the airplane.  He stated that this was 
the student pilot's fifth solo.  The pilot had been approved to practice landing pattern work.  On 
the first landing the student landed the airplane hard.  The airplane ballooned and veered to 
the right off the runway, where it struck a taxiway sign.
Repeated unsuccessful attempts were made to obtain airplane and pilot information from both 
the airplane owner and the student pilot.
