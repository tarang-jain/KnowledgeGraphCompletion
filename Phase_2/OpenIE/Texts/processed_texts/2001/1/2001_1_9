The student pilot reported that a crosswind kept the airplane left of the runway's centerline.  
The airplane's left main landing gear struck a snow bank and the airplane veered off the 
runway.  The pilot applied full power; however, the airplane nosed down, the left wing and 
propeller struck the ground, and the airplane returned to a level attitude before coming to rest.
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the crosswind conditions, which resulted in the 
airplane striking a snow bank during the landing flare/touchdown.  A factor was the crosswind 
weather condition.
On January 4, 2001, at 1500 central standard time, a Cessna 152, single-engine airplane, 
N68472, sustained substantial damage when the left main landing gear struck a snow bank 
during the landing flare/touchdown on runway 17 at the Jones Memorial Airport, Bristow, 
Oklahoma.  The airplane was owned by Christiansen Aviation at Tulsa, Oklahoma, and 
operated by the Oklahoma State University, at Stillwater, Oklahoma, under 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 91.  The student pilot, sole occupant, was not injured.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed for the instructional flight, and a visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan was 
filed.  The cross-country flight departed Shawnee, Oklahoma, at 1345.
The pilot reported that a "slight crosswind from approximately 180 degrees kept me left of 
course to touchdown."  At touchdown, the airplane continued left until the "left main [landing 
gear] hit the snow bank."  The airplane veered off the runway into the grass.  The pilot applied 
full power for a soft field takeoff "but it didn't work."  The airplane nosed down, the left wing 
and propeller struck the ground, and the airplane returned to a level attitude before coming to 
rest.  
The operator's personnel responding to the accident site, found the left wing bent and 
crumpled with structural damage to the main spar.  The operator reported the wind from the 
south at 10 knots.
