The pilot reported that during the landing roll on runway 28L with a 90 degree crosswind, the 
aircraft encountered a gust of wind.  The aircraft veered to the side of the runway and the right 
wing contacted a runway edge light and the propeller contacted the ground.  At the time of the 
accident, the airport was reporting winds from 180 degrees at nine knots, gusting to 16 knots.
The pilot's failure to adequately compensate for wind conditions.  Wind gusts were a factor.
On June 1, 2001, approximately 1400 mountain daylight time, a Cessna TR182, N4602S, 
registered to Leeward Winery and operated by the private pilot as a 14 CFR Part 91 personal 
flight, collided with a runway light during the landing roll at Boise Air Terminal (Gowen Field), 
Boise, Idaho.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and a visual flight rules 
flight plan was filed.  The aircraft was substantially damaged and the private pilot and his 
passenger were not injured.  The flight departed from Concord, California, about 1115.  
The pilot reported to a Federal Aviation Administration Inspector from the Boise Flight 
Standards District Office and in a subsequent written statement, that during the landing roll 
with a 90 degree crosswind on runway 28L, the aircraft encountered a gust of wind.  The 
aircraft veered to the side of the runway and the right wing contacted a runway edge light, and 
the propeller contacted the ground.  Maintenance personnel performing repairs on the aircraft 
reported that the former tip rib on the right wing was damaged, and approximately 12 to 16 
inches of leading edge wing skin, requiring an additional seam, was spliced in.  
At 1406,  the Boise airport was reporting winds from 180 degrees at nine knots, gusting to 16 
knots.
