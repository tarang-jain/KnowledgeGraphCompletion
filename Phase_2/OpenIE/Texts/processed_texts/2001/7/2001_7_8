The airplane contacted a guy wire and collided with the terrain during an aerial application 
flight.  The pilot reported he saw the poles during the aerial application flight.  He reported he 
knew that there would be wires in the area so he swung out wide during a turn to look for the 
wires.  The right wing contacted a guy wire during the turn.  The airplane then settled into the 
sunflower crop.
The pilot failed to see and avoid the guy wire during an aerial application flight.  A factor 
associated with the accident was the guy wire.
