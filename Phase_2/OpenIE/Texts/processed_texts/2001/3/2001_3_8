This was the student pilot's first solo flight. The first two landings on runway 35 had been 
accomplished without incident. The approach for a third landing had to be abandoned because 
there was an airplane still on the runway. The next approach resulted in a normal landing but 
during the rollout, the airplane raised up on its left main landing wheel. "I couldn't control the 
plane," the pilot wrote. The airplane veered "very hard" to the left into a snow bank. Winds 
recorded 6 minutes after the accident were from 240 degrees at 6 knots. This would present 
the pilot with slightly less than a 6 knot left crosswind component and a 2 knot tailwind 
component.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during landing.
On March 3, 2001, approximately 1245 mountain standard time, N152RC, a Cessna 152, owned 
and operated by Utah State University, was substantially damaged when it collided with terrain 
during landing on runway 30 at Logan-Cache Airport, Logan, Utah. The student pilot, the only 
occupant aboard, was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight 
plan had been filed for the instructional flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91. The 
flight originated at Logan at 1230.
