The airplane veered into a snowbank after touching down on the runway at approximately 27 
knots above the stall speed with an 8 knot crosswind component.  The pilot stated that he 
probably had too much left airleron and not enough right rudder to keep centered on landing 
rollout.
the excessive touchdown airspeed and the directional control not maintained by the pilot.  The 
snow bank was a contributing factor.
On February 3, 2001, at 1110 eastern standard time, a Cessna 172RG, N369ER, owned and 
piloted by a private pilot, was substantially damaged during a loss of directional control while 
landing on runway 27 (3,550 feet by 60 feet, asphalt) at the Oakland/Troy Airport (7D2), Troy, 
Michigan.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The 14 CFR 
Part 91 personnel flight was not operating on a flight plan.  The pilot reported no injuries.  The 
local flight originated from the Ann Arbor Municipal Airport, Ann Arbor, Michigan at 1050.
The pilot reported, "...At 7D2, I was on a normal 1 1/2 - 2 mile final approach for Rwy 27 with a 
10 kt x-wind out of 210 degrees (approx).  Full flaps (30 degrees) were deployed and I touched 
down near threshold on runway centerline at about 65-70 knots.  I was holding left aileron and 
attempting to track rwy centerline with right rudder.  A few seconds after touchdown I found 
myself drifting to the left and left main gear wheel entered and became entrapped in adjacent 
12-15 inch snowbank.  This caused the aircraft to veer counterclockwise to the left as in a 
ground loop and the nose entered and impacted the frozen snowbank bringing the 
engine/propeller to a sudden stop.  Final attitude was about 20 degrees nose down.  I probably 
had too much left aileron and not enough right rudder to keep centered on landing rollout or 
did not compensate for changing wind conditions fast enough.  There may have been some 
light gusts or wind shear due to adjacent structures.  In any event, not enough concentration".
The Oakland County Airport automated surface observing system, located approximately 13 
nm on a 305 degree heading from7D2 record at 1053, wind 216 degrees at 8 knots. 
The pilot reported a total flight time of 136 hours of which 53 were in the make and model of 
the accident airplane.  He had flown 33 hours in the previous 90 days.
Advisory Circular 61-21A, Flight Training Handbook, states, "...The roundout and touchdown 
should be made with the engine idling, and the airplane at minimum controllable airspeed, so 
that the airplane will touchdown on the main gear at approximately stalling speed..."
The Cessna 172RG stall speed at maximum gross weight with the landing gear and flaps 
extended is 39 KIAS with a most rearward center of gravity (CG) and 42 KIAS with a most 
forward CG.
