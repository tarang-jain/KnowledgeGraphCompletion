The airplane had a total loss of engine power and the pilot made an emergency landing.  The 
airplane  was at a cruise altitude of 4,000 feet msl when the engine lost power.  The pilot said 
that he verified that the electric fuel pump switch was in the "on" position.  He then moved the 
fuel mixture control to the "full rich" position and engaged the starter.  After his unsuccessful 
attempts to start the engine, he made an emergency forced landing in open desert terrain.
A total loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.  Contributing to the accident was the 
rough/uneven terrain.
On February 1, 2001, at 1934 hours mountain standard time, an amateur-built experimental 
Arthur Dragonfly, N29KK, lost engine power and made an emergency forced landing southeast 
of Marana, Arizona.  During the landing, the aircraft encountered rough terrain.  The airplane 
sustained substantial damage, and the certificated private pilot, the sole occupant, received 
only minor injuries.  The airplane was being operated by the pilot/owner as a personal flight 
under 14 CFR Part 91 when the accident occurred.  The local flight originated from the Marana 
Northwest Regional Airport about 1910.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time 
and no flight plan had been filed.
The pilot told Safety Board investigators that he had been in cruise flight at 4,000 feet mean 
sea level when the engine quit.  He said that he verified that the electric fuel pump switch was 
in the "on" position.  He then moved the fuel mixture control to the "full rich" position and 
engaged the starter.  After his unsuccessful attempts to start the engine, he made an emergency 
forced landing in open desert terrain.  During the forced landing, the forward canard was 
damaged.
