The airplane struck a pipe, cartwheeled, and came to rest inverted, following a go-around from 
a simulated forced landing.  The pilot reported he had been taking photographs about 1,000 
feet above ground level, then decided to practice engine out patterns.  During the go-around 
from the second pattern he added power, retracted the flaps to 20 degrees, and was unable to 
prevent contact with the ground.  The pilot further stated that it "felt like the elevator stalled."
A stall/mush inadvertently encountered by the pilot-in-command.  Failure to maintain 
adequate airspeed for flight and inadequate remedial action contributed to the accident.
On May 2, 2001, at 1320 hours Pacific daylight saving time, a Cessna 177B, N34168, was 
substantially damaged when it collided with the ground while maneuvering approximately 3 
miles east of Santa Maria Airport, Santa Maria, California.  The airplane was operated under 
the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91 by the private pilot/owner who received minor injuries.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight, 
which departed from Santa Maria Airport approximately 1250.
