The commercial air taxi pilot related he was attempting to land on a gravel runway in a direct 
crosswind of approximately 15 knots.  During the final approach to land, he said the airplane 
stalled, and landed hard.  The airplane went off the side of the runway and received substantial 
damage.  The pilot indicated there were no preimpact mechanical problems with the airplane.
The pilot's inadvertent stall/mush during the final phase of the landing approach.  A factor 
associated with the accident is a crosswind.
On May 3, 2001, about 1050 Alaska daylight time, a wheel-equipped Piper PA-32-300 airplane, 
N4089W, operated under 14 CFR Part 135 as an on-demand cargo flight by Bellair, Inc., 
received substantial damage while landing at the Chefornak Airport, Chefornak, Alaska.  The 
solo commercial-certificated pilot was not injured. The  flight operated in visual meteorological 
conditions, and a VFR and company flight plan were in effect.  The flight departed Bethel, 
Alaska, about 1000, en route to Chefornak.
During a telephone interview with the NTSB investigator-in-charge on May 3, the pilot of the 
accident airplane related that he departed Bethel with 1,000 pounds of U.S. mail for 
Chefornak.  It was his intent to deposit the mail at Chefornak, and return to Bethel.  He said 
the flight to Chefornak was uneventful.  He elected to land on runway 34, and noted the surface  
wind  was nearly a direct crosswind from the west, at 10-15 miles per hour.  As he approached 
the landing threshold, he said his indicated airspeed was about 80 miles per hour, when the 
airplane suddenly stalled, landed hard, and bounced off the right side of the runway.  The pilot 
said the airplane received substantial damage to the right wing and fuselage.  He also said there 
were no preimpact mechanical problems with the airplane.
