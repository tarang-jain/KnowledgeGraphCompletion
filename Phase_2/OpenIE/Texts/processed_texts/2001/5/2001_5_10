After a hard landing, the airplane veered off the runway and collided with airport property.  
The pilot executed a go-around then landed without further incident.  Witnesses saw the 
airplane make a hard landing, veer off the runway into the dirt, hit a light and taxiway sign, 
then takeoff again with items embedded in the horizontal stabilizer.
The pilot's failure to maintain the proper descent and his failure to maintain directioinal 
control during landing.
On May 3, 2001, at 2040 hours Pacific daylight time, a Cessna T210N, N6425N, veered off the 
runway while landing on runway 28, and struck a landing light and taxiway sign at the 
Truckee-Tahoe Airport, Truckee, California.  The airplane was operated by the pilot/owner 
under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91, and sustained substantial damage.  The private pilot 
and one passenger were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the 
personal flight that departed Oakland, California, at 1920.  The flight was scheduled to 
terminate at the Truckee-Tahoe Airport.  No flight plan had been filed.
The pilot stated that the airplane landed hard on the first attempt, and the landing was 
aborted.  On the second attempt, the airplane landed hard again, the pilot lost directional 
control, and the horizontal stabilizer was damaged after it struck a landing light and taxiway 
sign.
The Safety Board Investigator-in-Charge (IIC) interviewed a witness to the accident.  The 
witness stated that the airplane made a hard landing and departed the runway where it struck a 
sign, and then it took off again with the sign embedded in the airplane.  The airplane went 
around in the pattern and landed normally.
A Federal Aviation Administration inspector conducted an on-scene investigation.  He 
reported that part of a taxiway sign was embedded in the horizontal stabilizer and compression 
wrinkles were observed on the left side of the airplane near the baggage door.
