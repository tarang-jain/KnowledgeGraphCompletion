The airplane was on final approach to land when the pilot experienced a strong crosswind. 
Upon landing the airplane bounced on the runway, the nose of the airplane impacted the 
ground and the airplane flipped inverted.
The pilot's improper use of flight controls during a bounced landing, and subsequent collision 
with the ground. A factor of the collision is the rough and uneven terrain.
On May 2, 2001, at 1030 eastern daylight time, a Cessna C182P, N1491S, flipped over during a 
crosswind landing on the grass strip at Chalet Suzanne Air Strip, Lake Wales, Florida. The 
personal flight was conducted by the pilot under  provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91 with an 
instrument  flight plan filed. Visual weather conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. 
The airplane was substantially damaged. The airline transport  pilot and his three passengers 
were not injured. The flight departed Ocala Regional Airport, in Ocala, Florida, at 1000.
According to the pilot, during a crosswind landing on runway 36 at Chalet Suzanne Air Strip, 
"while making a normal approach, right after the nose lowered to the ground, the nose either 
hit a rock or hole. The  nose pitched up and down repeatedly. The nose of the plane dug into 
the turf and the airplane flipped on its back". The airplane came to rest inverted. The pilot 
stated that the runway was rough and uneven terrain. The pilot and passengers then exited the 
airplane.
The pilot did not report a mechanical problem with the airplane. Examination of the airplane  
failed to disclose any mechanical malfunction or component failure. A review of recorded 
weather data disclosed that, weather conditions at the time of the accident showed winds 090 
at 14 knots. According to The Pilot Operating Handbook, the maximum demonstrated 
crosswind is 15 knots.
