SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF, THE PILOT DISCOVERED THAT THE ELEVATOR CONTROLS 
WERE JAMMED AND PITCH CHANGES COULD ONLY BE MADE WITH ELEVATOR TRIM AND 
POWER. AN EMERG LANDING WAS MADE USING THE TRIM, BUT THE PILOT WAS 
UNABLE TO FLARE THE AIRCRAFT AT LANDING SPEED. THE AIRCRAFT STRUCK THE RUNWAY WITH 
THE NOSE GEAR, BREAKING THE NOSE GEAR OFF. A POST-ACCIDENT EXAM 
REVEALED THAT AN AUTOPILOT ADAPTER FLANGE (RECENTLY INSTALLED TO THE 
BACK OF THE PILOT'S ATTITUDE INDICATOR) WAS IN A POSITION TO CAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLH THE 
ELEVATOR SECONDARY STOP ON THE PILOT'S CONTROL COLUMN. THE ELEVATOR 
CONTROL COULD HAVE BEEN FORCIBLY FREED, BUT IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A 
LARGE FORCE TO DO SO.
