DURING FLIGHT, THE ENG BEGAN MISSING, SO THE PILOT APPLIED CARB HEAT, BUT THIS 
DID NOT HELP. HE NOTED A TRACE OF ICE ON THE UPPER PART OF THE 
WINDSHIELD AND DECIDED TO LAND BEFORE THE ENG POWER DETERIORATED 
FURTHER. WHILE LANDING IN A PASTURE, THE AIRCRAFT HIT SOFT SAND, WENT OVER 
ON ITS NOSE, BEGAN BURNING AND WAS DESTROYED. NO REASON WAS FOUND FOR 
THE PARTIAL LOSS OF POWER.
