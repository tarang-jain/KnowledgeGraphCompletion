THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THIS ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT'S INABILITY TO SEE AND 
AVOID OBSTRUCTING TERRAIN. SINCE THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED IN FEBRUARY, 
THE MOUNTAINS WERE COVERED WITH SNOW AND ON AN OVERCAST DAY AND 
WITH THE REPORTED FOG, THE PILOT IN COMMAND EITHER FLEW INTO THE FOG, 
THE CLOUDS OR A WHITEOUT CONDITION. THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH RISING 
TERRAIN DURING DESCENT.
