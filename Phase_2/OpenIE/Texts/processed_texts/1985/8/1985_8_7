FIELD, THE AIRCRAFT YAWED SHARPLY TO THE LEFT AND THE YAW COULD NOT BE 
CONTROLLED WITH CYCLIC CONTROL. ANOTHER LEFT TURN AT THE OPPSITE END 
OF THE FIELD THE AIRCRAFT AGAIN YAWED TO THE LEFT. CONTROL WAS REGAINED 
AND AS A PRECAUTIONARY LANDING WAS BEING MADE IN THE COTTON FIELD THE 
MAIN ROTOR BLADES STRUCK THE GROUND CAUSING THE AIRCRAFT TO ROLL ONTO 
ITS SIDE. POST CRASH INSPECTION OF THE AIRCRAFT'S FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM
