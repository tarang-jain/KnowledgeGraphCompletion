WHILE HOVERING AND SLINGING AN EXTERNAL LOAD OVER ROUGH TERRAIN THE 
ENG CHIP LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE PILOT IMMEDIATELY POSITIONED THE AIRCRAFT TO 
RELEASE THE LOAD AND THE ENG BEGAN MAKING A 'WHINING' NOISE. SEVERAL 
SECONDS LATER ALL ENG POWER WAS LOST. THE PILOT AUTOROTATED TO A FIRM 
LANDING AND UPON TOUCHDOWN THE MAIN ROTOR BLADES FLEXED DOWNWARD 
AND SEVERED THE TAIL BOOM. EXAM OF THE ENG'S TURBINE COMPONENTS 
REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF A 'SLUDGE' MATERIAL IN THE SCAVENGE OIL LINE 
FROM THE NO. 8 BEARING AND ALSO THE PRESENCE OF A HEAVY BUILD UP OF 
CARBON ON THE ENGINE ROTOR 'PEASHOOTER' DRIVE SHAFT. THE ACCUMULATED 
MATERIAL CAUSED SHAFT RUB AND FAILURE OF THE POWER TURBINE'S INNER 
SHAFT. THE OPERATOR REPORTED THAT AN EARLY INSPECTION OF THE N1/N2 
DRIVE SHAFT AREA COULD HAVE DETECTED THE PROBLEM AND PREVENTED THE 
ACCIDENT.
