WHILE ON A X-COUNTRY FLIGHT, THE AIRCRAFT ENCOUNTERED TURBULENCE AND 
DOWNDRAFTS. THE PILOT STATED THAT AT 1ST, HE WAS NOT CONCERNED, BUT THEN 
IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE AIRCRAFT MAY IMPACT THE GROUND. THE AIRCRAFT HAD 
LIMITED POWER (75 HP) AND THE TERRAIN ELEVATION IN THAT AREA WAS APPROXIMATELY 7000 
FEET MSL. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE AIRCRAFEET DESCENDED INTO THE GROUND AND FLIPPED OVER 
AFTER IMPACT.
