THE AIRCRAFT EXPERIENCED AN INTERMITTENT POWER LOSS IN CRUISE FLIGHT. THE PILOT'S 
ATTEMPTS TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL AND HE ELECTED TO 
EXECUTE A PRECAUTIONARY LANDING ON A ROAD. DURING THE LANDING, THE 
AIRCRAFT STRUCK A WIRE AND VEERED INTO TREES ALONG THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. THE 
PILOT STATED THAT HE HAD NOT APPLIED CARB HEAT DURING THE EMERGENCY 
BECAUSE HE CONSIDERED CARB ICE IMPROBABLE. THE ICING PROBABILITY CHART 
INDICATED THE POSSIBILITY OF CARB ICING AT GLIDE AND CRUISE POWER SETTINGS. 
AIRCRAFT WAS FUEL WITH A MIXTURE OF AUTO GAS AND AVIATION FUEL.
