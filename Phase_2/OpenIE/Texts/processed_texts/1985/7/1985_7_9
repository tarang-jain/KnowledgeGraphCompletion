DURING A BANNER TOWING MISSION, THE AIRCRAFT WAS OBSERVED FLYING AT LOW 
ALT NEAR CALIFORNIA STATE FREEWAY 91. ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, THE 
BANNER COLLIDED WITH POWER LINES AFTER THE AIRCRAFT HAD CROSSED OVER THE 
LINES AT A RELATIVELY SLOW SPEED. THE BANNER AND TOW CABLE/ROPE RELEASED 
FROM THE AIRCRAFT AND THE BANNER CAME TO REST ON THE POWER LINES. WITNESSES 
REPORTED THAT WHEN THE BANNER HIT THE POWER LINES, THE AIRCRAFT'S FORWARD 
MOVEMENT APPEARED TO STOP, THEN THE AIRCRAFT DROPPED OFF TO ITS LEFT AND 
DESCENDED INTO THE PATH OF AN ONCOMING TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK. THE 
AIRCRAFT HAD NEARLY RECOVERED FROM THE DESCENT WHEN IT IMPACTED THE 
FREEWAY. THE DRIVER OF THE TRACTOR-TRAILER AND HIS WIFE EXITED THE LEFT 
SIDE OF THE VEHICLE WITHOUT INJURY; HOWEVER, THEIR SON, WHO EXITED THE 
RIGHT SIDE DURING THE EVACUATION, RECEIVED MINOR INJURIES. THE AIRCRAFT AND 
TRACTOR WERE DESTROYED BY IMPACT AND FIRE. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A 
MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION WITH THE AIRCRAFT OR TOWING EQUIPMENT PRIOR TO 
THE COLLISION WITH THE POWER LINES.
