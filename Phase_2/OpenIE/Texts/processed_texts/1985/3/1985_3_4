THE PILOT WAS COMMENCING HIS 1ST SOLO X-COUNTRY FLIGHT. AT LIFT-OFF, THE AIRCRAFT 
ENTERED A LEFT BANK OF ABOUT 45 DEGS. THE STUDENT PILOT REDUCED POWER AND 
THE AIRCRAFT TOUCHED DOWN HARD ON THE DIRT BESIDE THE RUNWAY AND WAS DAMAGED. 
THE PILOT BELIEVED THAT HE MAY HAVE ENCOUNTERED TURBC FROM A BOEING 737. 
THE BOEING 737 TOOK OFF ABOUT 2 MINS EARLIER ON RUNWAY 11L. HOWEVER, IT DID 
NOT LIFEET OFF UNTIL IT WAS ABOUT 2000 FEET BEYOND THE INTERSECTION OF RUNWAY 21 
AND RUNWAY 11L. THE CESSNA HAD NOT YET REACHED THE INTERSECTION WHEN IT 
BANKED TO THE LEFT. THE PILOT HAD ONLY 1.3 HRS SOLO FLIGHT TIME.
