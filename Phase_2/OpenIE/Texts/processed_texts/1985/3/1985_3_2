THE PILOT STATED THAT HE WAS RETURNING TO THE ARPT AND WAS ON THE BASE 
LEG OF THE TRAFFIC PATTERN WHEN HE EXPERIENCED A PARTIAL LOSS OF ENG 
POWER. THE PILOT STATED THAT WHEN HE TURNED ON THE BOOST PUMP, POWER WAS 
RESTORED FOR A SHORT TIME. HE CONTINUED TO STATE THAT HE COULD NOT 
RESTORE SUFFICIENT POWER TO MAINTAIN FLIGHT. AN EMERGENCY LANDING WAS 
EXECUTED IN AN OPEN FIELD. POST CRASH EXAM OF THE ENG REVEALED NO 
EVIDENCE OF A MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION OR FAILURE. THE PILOT HAS 2.5 HOURS 
OF FLIGHT TIME IN THIS MAKE AND MODEL AIRCRAFT. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE MANAGED 
TO GET THE ENG STARTED ON BASE LEG AFTER THE INITIAL POWER LOSS BY USING 
THE FUEL BOOST PUMP. HE STATED THAT AFTER THE ENG STARTED HE FLIPPED 
THE BOOST PUMP SWITCH OFF AND THE ENG IMMEDIATELY LOST POWER AGAIN. THE 
PILOTS HANDBOOK (FLIGHT MANUAL) STATES THAT THE PUMP SHOULD BE ON FOR AN 
AIR START AND  LEFT ON IF THE FUEL PUMP IS SUSPECTED OF FAILURE LOSS OF FUEL 
PRESSURE WITH BOOST PUMP OFF. THE PILOT INDICATED THE START PROCESS WAS 
REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES WITH SIMILIAR RESULTS.
