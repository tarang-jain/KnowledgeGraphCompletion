THE AIRCRAFT ENG HAD JUST BEEN TOP OVERHAULED AND A STOL KIT WAS ADDED. THE 
MECHANIC REPORTEDLY TOLD THE PILOT TO BE 'EASY' ON THE ENG AND FLY THE 
AIRCRAFT 45-60 MINS NEAR THE TRAFFIC PATTERN SO IT COULD BE CHECKED FOR OIL 
LEAKS. THE PILOT REPORTEDLYIGNORED THESE INSTRUCTIONS, LEFT THE TRAFFIC 
PATTERN AND WAS SEEN PERFORMING ABRUPT CLIMBING AND DESCENDING 
MANEUVERS. A WITNESS REPORTED SEEING THE AIRCRAFT SEVERAL MILES FROM THE 
ARPT TRAILING THIN WHITE SMOKE SHORTLY BEFORE THE ENG STOPPED.THE AIRCRAFT 
THEN MADE A STEEP LEFT TURN AND 'LOST ALTITUDE QUICKLY' IMPACTING TREES. 
ON SCENE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE LANDING GEAR AND FLAPS WERE IN THE 
FULL EXTENDED POSITION. A NEGLIGABLE AMT OF OIL WAS IN THE ENG AND NO 
EVIDENCE OF AN OIL LEAK WAS FOUND. ENG TEARDOWN REVEALED EVIDENCE OF 
OIL STARVATION. TWO HOLES WERE FOUND WORN IN THE OIL PRESSURE LINETO 
THE TURBOCHARGER, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE INTERNAL TEFLON LINER WAS 
TRANSFORMED TO ASHES BY INTENSE POST CRASH FIRE IT COULD NOT BE 
DETERMINED IF THE HOLES WERE WORN THROUGH THE INTERNAL LINER.
