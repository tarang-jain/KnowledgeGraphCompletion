WHILE EN ROUTE AND ABOUT 15 MI FROM HIS DESTINATION, THE PILOT NOTED THAT 
BOTH THE ENG RPM AND THE OIL PRESSURE WERE DECREASING. SUBSEQUENTLY, HE 
MADE AN EMERG LANDING IN AN AREA OF SMALL TREES AND BRUSH NEXT TO A 
SWAMP. AN EXAM OF THE ENG WAS MADE, BUT NO MECHANICAL FAILURE OR 
MALFUNCTION WAS FOUND THAT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A LOSS OF POWER.
