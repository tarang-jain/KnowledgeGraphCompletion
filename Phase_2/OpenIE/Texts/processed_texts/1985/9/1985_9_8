THE AIRCRAFT WAS CRUSING AT 2,000 FT, 50 MIN AFTER TAKEOFF WHEN THE ENG 
BEGAN RUNNING ROUGH, LOST RPM, AND THEN QUIT. THE PILOT MADE A FORCED 
LANDING IN A SMALL FLD AND THE COLLIDED WITH TREES DURING THE LANDING 
ROLL. THE INVESTIGATION, WHICH INCLUDED RUNNING THE ENG TO 1800 RPM, 
FAILED TO REVEAL ANY EVIDENCE TO EXPLAIN THE REPORTED LOSS OF POWER.
