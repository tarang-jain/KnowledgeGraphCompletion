THE INSTRUMENT FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR AND STUDENT EXPERIENCED A 
DIRECTIONAL GYRO FAILURE. THEY COVERED THE INSTRUMENT AND REQUESTED A 
RETURN TO THEIR DEPARTURE POINT. THE AIRCRAFT WAS NOT EQUIPPED TO FLY 
THE PUBLISHED APPROACH. THEY REQUESTED A DESCENT TO AN ALTITUDE BELOW 
THE BASE OF THE CONTROLLER'S RADAR, AND DISAPPEARED SHORTLY AFTER. THE 
AIRCRAFT IMPACTED TALL TREES IN RAINSHOWER. WITNESSES REPORTED THAT 
CLOUD BASE WAS AT TREE TOP LEVEL. INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED FOR PARTIAL 
PANEL FLIGHT WERE FUNCTIONAL. NO OTHER DISCREPANCIES WERE NOTED.
