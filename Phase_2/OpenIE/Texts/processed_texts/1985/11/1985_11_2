ACCORDING TO THE PILOT THE FLIGHT FROM TOLEDO TO THE KENOSHAAREA WAS 
UNEVENTFUL. DURING THE VOR APPROACH TO RUNWAY 14 (APPROX 2 MILES FROM THE 
END OF THE RUNWAY) THE AIRCRAFT IMPACTED THE GROUND AND WAS 
DESTROYED. THE PILOT STATED THAT THE LAST THING HE REMBERED BEFORE 
IMPACT WAS SEEING 1100 FEET MSL ON HIS ALTIMETER. HE WAS USING THE 
CORRECT ALTIMETER SETTING. THE ALTIMETER WAS LATER GIVEN A COMPLETE 
SCALE ERROR CHECK AT AN INDEPENDENT AVIONICS REPAIR FACILITY. THE 
RESULTS OF THIS TEST INDICATED AN ERROR RANGE OF -400 FEET AT A SIMULATED 
ALTITUDE OF 1000 FEET TO -950 FEET AT A SIMULATED ALTITUDE OF 20000 FEET. IT IS A 
NON-ENCODING ALTIMETER AND WAS LAST CHECKED BY A CERTIFIED REPAIR 
STATION APPROXIMATELY 19 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.
