SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF, THE PILOT OF THE BEECH A36TC AIRCRAFT ACTIVATED WHAT 
HE BELIEVED WAS THE FLAP RETRACTION LEVER, AND THE ENG QUIT. THE PILOT 
MADE A FORCED LANDING APPROXIMATELY 1000 FEET FROM THE RUNWAY DEPARTURE END. DURING 
THE INVESTIGATION, THE ENG WAS STARTED AND FUNCTIONED NORMALLY, UNTIL 
THE EMERG FUEL PUMP (EFP) SWITCH WAS ACTIVATED, WHICH RESULTED IN THE 
ENG QUITTING DUE TO FLOODING. THIS STEP WAS REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES WITH 
THE SAME RESULTS. THE EFP SWITCH AND FLAP RETRACTION LEVER ARE APPROXIMATELY TWO 
INCHES APART.
