A STUDENT PILOT WAS ON HIS 1ST SOLO X-COUNTRY FLIGHT IN A CESSNA 152, N6464L. 
AFTER TAKING OFF AT THE BROOKFIELD ARPT (ELEV 850 FT), HE HAD CLIMBED TO 
2000 FEET MSL AND WAS HEADING 350 DEG WHEN HE SAW A BEECH B35 (BONANZA), 
N5182C, CONVERGING FROM HIS RIGHT. THE STUDENT TOOK EVASIVE ACTION, BUT 
THE PROP AND RIGHT WING TIP OF THE BEECH B35 HIT THE RIGHT HORIZONTAL 
STABILIZER, RIGHT WING ROOT AND RIGHT FLAP OF THE CESSNA. THE COMMERCIALLY 
RATED PILOT OF THE BEECH B35 WAS CRUISING WESTBOUND AT 2000 FEET MSL. HE DID 
NOT SEE THE CESSNA UNTIL AFTER THE COLLISION. BOTH AIRCRAFT WERE 
SUBSTANTIALLYDAMAGED, BUT BOTH CONTINUED FLYING AND WERE LANDED 
WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.
