FOLLOWING A DURAL ENGINE CHANG, THE PILOT TEST FLEW THE AIRCRAFT. ON INITIAL 
CLIMB, AT ABOUT 500 FEET AGL, BOTH ENGINES BEGAN BACKFIRING VIOLENTLY AND 
LOST POWER. ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, POWER SUFFICIENT FOR FLIGHT COULD NOT BE 
OBTAINED, AND A FORCED LDG WAS MADE ABOUT 0.75 MILES FROM THE ARPT. THE 
LDG OCCURRED IN OPEN DESERT TERRAIN AND THE AIRCRAFT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY 
DAMAGED. THE PILOT ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE DID NOT CHECK THE POSITION OF 
THE CONTROL HANDLES FOR THE SUPERCHARGERS DURING EITHER HIS PRE-
FLIGHT OR PRE-TAKEOFF INSPECTIONS. AND THE BLOWERS HAD BEEN 
INADVERTENTLY LEFT SET TO THE HIGH BLOWER POSITION. ACCORDING TO THE 
PILOT, THE CHECKLIST WHICH HE WAS USING FOR THE AIRCRAFT DID NOT ADDRESS THE 
POSITION OF THE BLOWERS BECAUSE FOR THE PAST 15 YRS IT HAD BEEN COMPANY 
POLICY TO 'WIRE THE BLOWERS TO THE LOW BLOWER POSITION.'
