TO ACCOMODATE HIS PAX'S REQUEST TO BE TRANSPORTED CLOSE TO HIS 
DESTINATION, THE PILOT LANDED THE AIRCRAFT ON A 350 FOOT-LONG DIRT ROAD. THE 
PAX DISEMBARKED AND THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO TAKE OFF ON THE SAME ROAD. THE 
AIRCRAFEET BECAME AIRBORNE IN GRND EFFECT, CLIMBED APPROXIMATELY 5 FEET THEN SETTLED 
BACK ON THE ROAD. THE AIRCRAFT OVERRAN THE END OF THE ROAD AND ENTERED SANDY 
TERRAIN. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE REALIZED THE AIRCRAFT WOULD NOT ACCELERATE 
IN THE SAND, SO HE ABORTED THE TAKEOFF. AS THE AIRCRAFT SLOWED TO A STOP IT 
NOSED OVER.
