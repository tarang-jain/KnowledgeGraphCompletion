The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, while on base for his private grass 
airstrip, he noticed he was high, so he added flaps to increase his descent. He added that, on 
final, the airspeed was a little fast and during the landing, he flared the airplane "a little high." 
After touchdown, the pilot applied the brakes, but the airplane did not respond, so he applied 
"a little more brake"; subsequently, the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings and the empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported as a safety recommendation that he should have performed a go-around 
instead of attempting to "salvage the landing."
The pilot's failure to maintain a stabilized approach and his subsequent incorrect brake 
application during the landing roll, which resulted in a nose-over.
