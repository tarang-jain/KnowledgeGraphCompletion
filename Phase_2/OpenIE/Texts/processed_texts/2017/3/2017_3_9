The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, while landing on a road in gusting 
crosswind conditions, the right wing lifted to about a 60Â° angle. He immediately initiated a go-
around and added full power and right aileron and lowered the nose. The airplane had drifted 
off the center of the road to the left heading toward power lines, and the pilot chose to go under 
them. After the airplane cleared the power lines, the left wing tip struck the ground, and the 
airplane cart-wheeled. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings, the fuselage, 
and the empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during a go-around.
