The pilot stated that he was conducting spray operations to a pasture with power lines on its 
north border. As the pilot approached the pasture from the north on his fourth pass, he 
intended to descend after flying past the second of two cables. The pilot initiated a descent, but 
the airplane struck the second cable. The airplane subsequently impacted the ground and a 
postimpact fire ensued. Following the accident, the pilot stated that he misidentified the first 
cable as the second cable.
