The pilot reported that, during final approach in gusting wind conditions at night, he reduced 
power and initiated a flare when he then heard the stall warning horn. He added that a "gust of 
wind caught [the] left wing," which he attempted to recover with left aileron inputs. The nose 
landing gear bounced during touchdown, and he applied full power to go around when a gust 
of wind "pushed [him] right into desert." The airplane bounced, impacted a fence, and came to 
rest inverted on the right side of the runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing, fuselage, and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
A review of recorded data from the automated weather observation station located on the 
airport revealed that, about 5 minutes before the accident, the wind was from 130° at 9 knots 
and that, about 15 minutes after the accident, the wind was from 140° at 10 knots, gusting to 17 
knots. The airplane landed on runway 19.
The pilot's inadequate compensation for gusting crosswind conditions at night and his delayed 
go-around, which resulted in the airplane bouncing and impacting a fence.
