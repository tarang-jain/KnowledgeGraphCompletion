The pilot reported that, during approach and after fully extending the flaps, he felt the airplane 
was descending too quickly, so he added power. He added that "the aircraft was nearly down 
when [a] crosswind" drifted the airplane off the runway centerline. The pilot added more 
power, but the stall warning horn sounded, and the nose dropped. The airplane impacted a 
drainage pond to the left of the runway and came to rest inverted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings and empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed and his exceedance of the airplane's critical 
angle of attack during landing with a crosswind, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and an 
off-runway landing.
