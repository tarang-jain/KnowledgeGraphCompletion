The sport pilot and the passenger were making a local flight in the powered parachute. The 
passenger, who survived the accident, reported that, about an hour into the flight, the pilot 
turned to the east toward the passenger's home. After overflying the passenger's home at low 
altitude, the pilot maneuvered the powered parachute to the east toward rising terrain and 
trees. The passenger's wife was outside her home at the time of the accident and noticed that 
the aircraft was flying low, and other witnesses also reported seeing the aircraft flying low 
before the accident. According to the passenger, the aircraft did not climb quickly enough to 
clear the trees; the landing gear struck about three trees; and the aircraft dropped into the 
woods striking tree limbs on the way down.
Postaccident examination of the wreckage did not reveal evidence of a preimpact mechanical 
malfunction or anomaly, and the passenger reported that he did not notice any significant 
change in engine speed before the aircraft struck the trees. The engine ran satisfactorily when 
tested after the accident.
The pilot's decision to maneuver the aircraft at low altitude, towards rising terrain, which 
resulted in an inflight collision with trees.
