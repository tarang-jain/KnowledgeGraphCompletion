The pilot reported that, while approaching the destination airport in night, marginal visual 
meteorological conditions, he turned on the pilot-controlled runway lights. He added that he 
began a descent to the runway without observing the runway lights or airport and encountered 
"ground fog" about 200 to 300 ft above ground level (agl). He further added that he continued 
the descent to the runway while referencing the navigational moving map and GPS altitude on 
his electronic flight bag (EFB) application ForeFlight. Subsequently, while in a left turn, the 
airplane impacted terrain about 1 nautical mile south of the runway. 
The left wing, firewall, and fuselage sustained substantial damage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation. He added that, while en route, he reset 
his airplane-installed barometric pressure altimeter to the GPS altitude indicated on his EFB, 
which resulted in a "300 ft. error." 
An automated weather observing station, about 14 nautical miles west of the accident airport, 
recorded visibility at 2 1/2 statute miles, light rain, mist, and an overcast cloud ceiling at 300 ft 
agl.
The pilot's decision to continue the night, visual flight into instrument meteorological 
conditions, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain while on final approach. 
Contributing to the accident was the pilot's improper use of an electronic flight bag.
