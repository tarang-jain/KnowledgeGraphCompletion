airplane sustained substantial damage to both left side wing struts, the rudder, and the 
windscreen. 
The student reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with 
the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
The student pilot's loss of directional control during the landing roll and his subsequent
