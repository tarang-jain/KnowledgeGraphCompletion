The pilot reported that, during the initial climb, about 1,000 ft above the ground, he "saw the 
engine power winding down." He added that he "turned on" the boost pump, checked the 
magnetos and fuel mixture, and then switched the fuel selector to the other fuel tank. The 
engine experienced a total loss of power and then impacted the ground. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. 
The Federal Aviation Administration inspector reported that he traveled to the accident, and 
while on-site, he observed that the fuel selector knob set screw was loose and that the knob 
turned freely on the shaft. 
The pilot did not submit the National Transportation Safety Board Form 6120.1 Pilot/Operator 
Aircraft Accident/Incident Report. 
The loose fuel tank selector knob set screw, which prevented the fuel selector from moving to 
the fuel tank position for the tank with usable fuel and resulted in fuel starvation and the 
subsequent total loss of engine power.
