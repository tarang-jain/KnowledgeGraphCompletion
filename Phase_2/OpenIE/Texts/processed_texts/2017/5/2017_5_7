The flight instructor reported that he and his student were practicing landings. He reported 
that his student's approach was unstable and left of the centerline as the airplane approached 
the runway numbers. The instructor called for a go-around and applied full throttle, and the 
student pitched for a climb, but the airplane stalled. The instructor pushed the nose down to 
increase the airspeed, but the airplane impacted the runway. The airplane sustained 
substantial damage to both wings and the empennage. 
The flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or 
failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
The student's incorrect use of the go-around procedure, which resulted in an aerodynamic 
stall, and the flight instructor's delayed remedial action.
