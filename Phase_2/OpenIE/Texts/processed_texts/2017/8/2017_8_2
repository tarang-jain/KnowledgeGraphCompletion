According to the pilot, he made two passes over a dry creek bed to assess a potential landing 
site. The second pass was accomplished up-creek into rising terrain. The airplane was 
configured with full power and with flaps at 20Â°, and it was about 50 ft above ground level at 
80 mph. The pilot reported that the airplane encountered a downdraft as it transitioned from 
overflying the trees to overflying the creek bed, which he attempted to correct, but the airplane 
aerodynamically stalled.
Following the stall, the pilot attempted to land on a dry creek bed. The airplane touched down 
on the creek bed, then bounced and descended into a "dry cut channel." The airplane came to 
rest nose down in a near vertical position. The airplane was destroyed by a postcrash fire.
According to the National Transportation Safety Board's Pilot Aircraft Accident Report, the 
pilot reported that the event could have been avoided by making the low pass along descending 
terrain at a higher airspeed. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
The airplane's encounter with a downdraft while maneuvering at a low altitude, which resulted 
in the exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack and a subsequent aerodynamic stall.
