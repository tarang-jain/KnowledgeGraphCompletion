The pilot reported that, during takeoff from a private turf airstrip, about 50 ft above the 
ground, the airplane encountered a wind gust that "quickly" lifted the left wing and pushed the 
airplane to the right. He added that he attempted to level the wings, but he "did not have 
enough aileron." Subsequently, the airplane impacted terrain in a nose-low, right-wing-down 
attitude. 
The fuselage and both wings sustained substantial damage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported that the temperature was 85°, the sky was clear, and the wind was from 
200° at 5 knots and not gusting. He took off from runway 23.
An automated weather observation station, about 14 nautical miles from the accident airport, 
recorded wind from 170° at 9 knots, gusting to 20 knots. 
The pilot's failure to maintain lateral/bank control during the takeoff climb in gusting 
crosswind conditions.
