wheel briefly touched down" and then "a wind gust pushed the plane down," which resulted in 
the nose gear impacting the runway hard. He added that he subsequently heard "a snapping 
popping bang under my feet" and that the airplane bounced. He further added that, when the 
airplane settled back to the runway, it skidded to the right off the runway.

The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the
