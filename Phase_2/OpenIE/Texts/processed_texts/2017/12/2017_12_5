The pilot reported that, while making a straight-in approach to a private airport just after dusk, 
but before dark, he attempted to activate the pilot-controlled lighting (PCL) but was 
unsuccessful. He added that he continued toward the airport, and while maneuvering for 
landing, he lost sight of the airport. The pilot did not regain visual reference of the airport 
during the landing descent, and the airplane impacted a fence adjacent to the runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The airport owner reported that the PCL antenna required line-of-sight with the aircraft to 
operate the PCL system. Due to the antenna's position and hangars on the airport, the antenna 
did not receive signals from the southeast, the direction from which the accident airplane was 
approaching. He added that, because the airport was private, he could not issue a NOTAM to 
describe the operation of the runway lights.
The pilot's decision to continue to land without visual reference to the airport in low light 
conditions. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's inability to activate the private airport's 
pilot-controlled lighting system due to its configuration.
