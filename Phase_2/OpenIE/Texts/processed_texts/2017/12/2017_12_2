The pilot of the experimental, amateur-built airplane reported that, during takeoff, he raised 
the nose after reaching about 20 mph, and about 40 mph, the airplane lifted off the runway. He 
"held the stick back just a little [too] long and it started to tip stall to the left and [he] pushed 
the stick forward." He added that he applied right aileron and rudder because the airplane was 
drifting to the left side of the runway. Subsequently, the airplane aerodynamically stalled and 
bounced on the runway, and the right wheel separated from the airplane. He then, with full 
power, continued to fly and make right aileron and rudder inputs to get back over the runway. 
The airplane impacted the ground and came to rest inverted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, and wings.
The automated weather observation system at the accident airport reported that, about the 
time of the accident, the wind was from 090Â° at 4 knots. The pilot was departing from runway 
18.
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during takeoff, which resulted in 
an aerodynamic stall.
