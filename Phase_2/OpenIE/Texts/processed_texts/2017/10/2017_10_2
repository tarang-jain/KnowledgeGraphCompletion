The pilot reported that, during landing, the airplane touched down about "150 ft. beyond [the 
runway] numbers" and he immediately "removed flaps and applied brakes." He added that he 
was "unable to stop the forward momentum of the plane," and he believed he was going to 
overrun the runway, so he applied full power to go-around. Subsequently, the airplane overran 
the runway before a climb rate could be established, and during the runway excursion, the 
airplane struck a chain link fence. During the impact, the right wing separated from the 
fuselage, and the airplane rolled inverted down a ravine before coming to a stop on the main 
landing gear. The pilot further reported that, after the accident, he believed he came in "too 
fast" for landing. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, and both wings. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's use of an incorrect airspeed during landing, which resulted in a runway overrun.
