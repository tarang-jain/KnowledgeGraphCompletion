The pilot reported that the airplane was low and that he felt "rushed" during final approach. He 
added that, during the landing roll, the airplane "started to veer off the runway," so he applied

The airplane then aerodynamically stalled and impacted grass left of the runway and then 
nosed over.
The fuselage, left wing, and vertical stabilizer sustained substantial damage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during an attempted go-around, 
which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
