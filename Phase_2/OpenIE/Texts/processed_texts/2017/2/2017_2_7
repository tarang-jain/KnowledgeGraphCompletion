The student pilot, who held a commercial fixed-wing pilot certificate, was performing hovering 
flight during his first helicopter lesson when the helicopter "suddenly jerked backwards." The 
helicopter's tail rotor gearbox and a portion of the tail rotor departed the helicopter, and the 
flight instructor landed the helicopter upright with no injuries to the two occupants.
According to the flight instructor, he monitored the cyclic, collective, and tail rotor controls 
while explaining hovering flight and surrendered each control to the student pilot one at a time 
until the student pilot was fully controlling the helicopter. As the helicopter transitioned 
backward and began a "spin to the left," he requested and took control of the helicopter, but 
the student pilot did not surrender the controls, and the flight instructor could not overpower 
the student pilot's inputs before the tail rotor collided with terrain. The flight instructor further 
stated that there were no mechanical deficiencies with the helicopter that would have 
precluded normal operation.
The student pilot's failure to relinquish the flight controls to the flight instructor, which 
resulted in a collision with terrain.
