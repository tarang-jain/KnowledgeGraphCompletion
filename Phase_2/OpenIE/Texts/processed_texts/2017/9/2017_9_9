The solo student pilot reported that, during approach, he felt a "slight sink." He added that the 
main landing gears touched down, and the airplane began to porpoise. The student pilot added

pilot reduced the power to idle and attempted to use brakes to steer. The airplane exited the 
runway to the left and impacted a taxiway sign.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing.
The student pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions 
with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The student pilot's improper landing flare and subsequent failure to maintain directional 
control during the landing roll.
