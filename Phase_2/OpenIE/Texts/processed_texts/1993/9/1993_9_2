THE AIRPLANE WAS OBSERVED TO FLY OVER THE AIRSTRIP FROM THE SOUTHWEST 
AT 200-300 FEET AGL, THEN BEGIN A TURN TO THE LEFEET AS A BASE TURN TO THE WEST 
THRESHOLD OF THE AIRSTRIP. THE TURN CONTINUED INTO A STEEP SPIRAL TURN, 
AND THE AIRPLANE IMPACTED THE GROUND IN A NEAR-VERTICAL ANGLE. THE 
WIND WAS FROM THE WEST AT ABOUT 30 MPH. THE AIRPLANE WAS EQUIPPED WITH 
32X15 BALLOON TUNDRA TIRES. THERE IS NO DATA RELATING TO AN EVALUATION 
OF THE AIRPLANE'S FLIGHT PERFORMANCE AND HANDLING ENVELOPE WITH THESE 
TIRES INSTALLED. AIRPLANE HAD NO REGISTRATION, FLIGHT MANUAL, WEIGHT 
AND BALANCE RECORD, NOR FORM 337'S FOR THE COMPLETE REBUILD AFTER THE 
AIRPLANE WAS REPORTED DESTROYED IN 1989. IN ADDITION, THERE WERE 
INSUFFICIENT STC OR FAA FIELD APPROVAL DOCUMENTS FOR MODIFICATIONS. THE 
AIRPLANE WAS AT LEAST 117 LBS OVER MAX GROSS WEIGHT. SHOULDER HARNESSES 
NOT INSTALLED. 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN FLYING SPEED DURING A DOWNWIND TURN 
FOR LANDING. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: THE 
OVERWEIGHT CONDITION OF THE AIRPLANE, AND FAILURE TO ASSURE THAT THE 
AIRPLANE COMPLIED WITH ALL APPLICABLE AIRWORTHINESS REGULATIONS.
