AS THE CAPTAIN WAS TURNING THE AIRPLANE OFF THE RUNWAY FOLLOWING ITS 
LANDING ROLL HE SAID IT WAS '...EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO TURN.' THE CAPTAIN 
SAID THE AIRPLANE TURNED TO A 45 DEGREE ANGLE TO THE RUNWAY AND WOULD 
GO NO FURTHER. THE STEERING SYSTEM FAILED AND THE CAPTAIN ATTEMPTED TO 
STOP THE AIRPLANE ON THE TAXIWAY USING BRAKES AND REVERSE THRUST.  THE 
AIRPLANE WOULD NOT STOP AND ROLLED OFF ONTO THE GRASS AREA ADJACENT 
TO THE TAXIWAY.  EXAMINATION OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM FOUND THE HYDRAULIC 
SYSTEM POWER TRANSFER UNIT'S (PTU) HOUSING WAS CRACKED AROUND ITS 
ENTIRE CIRCUMFERENCE.  THE PTU ON THE INCIDENT AIRPLANE WAS AN EARLY 
STYLE UNIT ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER'S SERVICE BULLETIN.  THE 
SERVICE BULLETIN ADVISED OWNERS OF THE AIRPLANE TO REPLACE THE 
ORIGINAL ALUMINUM HOUSING WITH A CAST IRON TYPE.  EXAMINATION OF THE 
PTU'S HOUSING FRACTURE SURFACES REVEALED SHRINKAGE CAVITIES, AND LARGE 
SILICON INCLUSIONS. 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
a fatigue failure of the power transfer unit caused by a material defect which resulted in a total 
hydraulic system failure.
