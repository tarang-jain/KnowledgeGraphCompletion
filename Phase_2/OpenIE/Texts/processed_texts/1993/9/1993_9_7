ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, AS THE AIRPLANE WAS ACCELERATING FOR TAKEOFF, IT 
BECAME AIRBORNE BRIEFLY, THEN IT SETTLED BACK ONTO THE RUNWAY.  HE 
REPORTED THAT HE ABORTED THE TAKEOFF, BUT THE AIRPLANE EXITED THE END 
OF THE RUNWAY.  ACCORDING TO THE FAA, THE PILOT WAS TAKING OFF FOR THE 
FIRST TIME WITH A PASSENGER AT THIS AIRPORT AND WAS NOT USING FLAPS. 
REPORTEDLY, THE PILOT STATED THAT HE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH AIRSPEED TO 
CONTINUE THE TAKEOFF, SO HE ABORTED THE TAKEOFF ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF 
THE WAY DOWN THE 2000 FOOT LONG RUNWAY.  THE AIRPLANE THEN VEERED TO 
THE LEFT AND STRUCK THE RUNWAY LIGHTS.  THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THERE 
WAS NO MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION, AND THE ACCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN 
PREVENTED IF THE RUNWAY WAS LONGER AND A SHORTFIELD TAKEOFF WAS 
EXECUTED. 
THE PILOT'S DELAY IN ABORTING THE TAKEOFF, AND HIS FAILURE TO MAINTAIN 
DIRECTIONAL CONTROL DURING THE ABORTED TAKEOFF.
