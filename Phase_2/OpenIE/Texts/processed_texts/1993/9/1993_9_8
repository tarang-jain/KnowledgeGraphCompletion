THE PILOT AND THREE PASSENGERS WERE ON A LOCAL SIGHTSEEING FLIGHT 
WHEN ON HIS RETURN TO THE AIRPORT, ONE OF THE PASSENGERS IN THE REAR 
SEAT BECAME ILL.  THE PILOT STATED THAT HE EXPEDITED THE APPROACH BY 
REDUCING THE POWER TO IDLE, AND COMMENCING A DESCENT OF ABOUT 1000 
FEET PER MINUTE ON THE DOWNWIND LEG.  HE STATED THAT THE AIRPLANE 
TOUCHED DOWN MIDFIELD AND HE WAS UNABLE TO STOP THE AIRPLANE IN TIME 
TO AVOID THE EMBANKMENT (BERM) AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY. THE AIRPLANE 
STRUCK THE EMBANKMENT AND CAME TO REST ABOUT 60 FEET FROM THE END OF 
THE RUNWAY.  THE PILOT STATED THAT THERE WAS NO MECHANICAL 
MALFUNCTION. 
THE PILOT MISJUDGED HIS AIRSPEED AND ALTITUDE WHICH RESULTED IN THE 
PILOT'S FAILURE TO ATTAIN THE PROPER TOUCHDOWN POINT RESULTNG IN THE 
AIRPLANE EXITING THE RUNWAY AND COLLIDING WITH THE BERM.  A RELATED 
FACTOR WAS THE LOCATION OF THE BERM.
