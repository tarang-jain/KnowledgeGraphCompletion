THE PILOT SAID WHILE ATTEMPTING TO TAKEOFF FROM A MOUNTAIN RIDGE, THE 
LEFT MAIN WHEEL ENTERED A DEPRESSION AND HE HAD TO USE HARDER THAN 
NORMAL CONTROL FORCES TO KEEP THE AIRPLANE ALIGNED WITH THE TAKEOFF 
PATH.  WHEN THE AIRPLANE CAME OUT OF THE DEPRESSION, IT BOUNCED INTO 
THE AIR AND BECAUSE OF THE LEFT QUARTERING HEADWIND, IT CAME BACK DOWN 
ON THE RIGHT MAIN WHEEL AND THE RIGHT WING.  THE AIRPLANE THEN SPUN 
AROUND CLOCKWISE ABOUT 180 DEGREES AND HIT ON THE NOSE, THEN THE LEFT 
WING.  BOTH MAIN LANDING GEAR BOXES WERE TORN OUT OF THE FUSELAGE, 
WHICH WAS ALSO DAMAGED. 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE. A FACTOR WAS 
THE  CROSSWIND.
