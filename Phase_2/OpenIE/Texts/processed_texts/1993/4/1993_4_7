PIREPS PROVIDED TO THE PILOT BY FSS PRIOR TO TAKEOFF INDICATED THAT FOG AND 
LOW VISIBILITY HAD BEEN ENCOUNTERED ON THE PILOT'S ROUTE TO THE EAST, 
FORCING AIRPLANES TO RETURN TO NOME. IN ADDITION, AS THE FLIGHT TAXIED 
FOR TAKEOFF, THE PILOT WAS TOLD '... VFR IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO THE EAST...' 
THE AIRPLANE IMPACTED FLAT SNOW COVERED TERRAIN IN A STEEP LEFT WING 
DOWN ATTITUDE APPROXIMATELY 4 MI EAST OF THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY. THE 
AREA WAS A TREELESS, SNOW COVERED FLAT COASTAL PLAIN BORDERED BY A SEA 
FROZEN WITH WHITE ICE. THE PILOT HAD RETURNED TO WORK 4/1 AFTER A 30-DAY 
SUSPENSION FOLLOWING A TAKEOFF ACCIDENT, AND WAS ASSIGNED ONLY TO 
CESSNA 207 'VFR ONLY' AIRPLANES. THE POI DID NOT DISCUSS THE EARLIER 
ACCIDENT OR THE PILOT WITH THE OPERATOR'S MANAGEMENT. 
THE PILOT INITIATED VFR FLIGHT INTO INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL AND 
WHITEOUT CONDITIONS. FACTORS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: 
INADEQUATE SUPERVISION OF THE PILOT BY THE COMPANY, INADEQUATE 
OVERSIGHT BY THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, THE PILOT'S SELF-
INDUCED PRESSURE TO CONDUCT THE FLIGHT, AND THE EXISTING WEATHER 
CONDITIONS AND SNOW COVERED TERRAIN.
