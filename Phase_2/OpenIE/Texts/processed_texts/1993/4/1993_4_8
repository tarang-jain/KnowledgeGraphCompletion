 AFTER MAKING A DOWNHILL TAKEOFF, AND JUST AFTER PASSING THE END OF THE 
RUNWAY, THE SKI EQUIPPED AIRPLANE DESCENDED AND COLLIDED WITH TREES 
AND A SNOWBANK.  THE RUNWAY WAS COVERED WITH ABOUT 12 INCHES OF 
SLUSHY WET SNOW. THE 57 HOUR PRIVATE PILOT SAID THAT THE AIRPLANES TAIL 
WHEEL (NOT EQUIPPED WITH A SKI) DRAGGING IN THE SNOW KEPT THE AIRPLANE 
FROM GETTING AIRBORNE SOONER.  AFTER HE GOT THE TAIL OUT OF THE SNOW, 
HE ATTEMPTED TO ROTATE BEFORE GAINING SUFFICIENT TAKEOFF AIRSPEED, 
WHICH PUT THE TAIL WHEEL BACK INTO THE SNOW.  THE AIRPLANE GOT AIRBORNE 
ABOUT 3/4 WAY DOWN THE RUNWAY, THEN FLEW IN GROUND EFFECT UNTIL 
PASSING OVER THE END OF THE RUNWAY AND LOWER TERRAIN.  THE PILOT HAD 
JUST RECENTLY PURCHASED THE AIRPLANE, AND FLEW IT (FOR THE FIRST TIME) 
FOR 1.8 HOURS WITH A MORE EXPERIENCED PILOT/FRIEND ON THE PREVIOUS DAY.  
THAT WAS ALSO HIS ONLY TIME AS THE PILOT OF AN AIRPLANE EQUIPPED WITH 
SKIS OR WITH A TAIL WHEEL. 
THE PILOT IN COMMAND'S PREMATURE LIFT-OFF. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO ABORT THE TAKEOFF, HIS LACK OF TOTAL EXPEREINCE IN 
THE TYPE AIRPLANE AND TYPE OPERATION, AND THE SLUSH COVERED RUNWAY.
