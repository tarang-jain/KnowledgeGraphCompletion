 THE PILOT OF THE WWII VINTAGE MILITARY AIRPLANE EXPERIENCED A COMPLETE 
LOSS OF ENGINE POWER WHILE CLIMBING THROUGH 5,000 FEET. THE 
PRESELECTED FORCED LANDING AREA WAS BEYOND THE GLIDING CAPABILITIES OF 
THE AIRPLANE, SO THE PILOT ELECTED TO LAND STRAIGHT AHEAD IN A ROUGH 
AND UNEVEN FIELD. THE FUSELAGE WAS SEVERED AFT OF THE PILOT'S SEAT AND 
BOTH WINGS AND THE UNDERSIDE OF THE AIRPLANE WERE SEVERELY DAMAGED. 
EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE FAILED TO DISCLOSE ANY ANOMALIES THAT COULD 
HAVE PREVENTED NORMAL ENGINE OPERATION 
 THE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS. A FACTOR WAS THE 
LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN FOR THE FORCED LANDING
