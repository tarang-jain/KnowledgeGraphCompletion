 THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE WAS PERFORMING A NORMAL LANDING; THE TAIL 
WHEEL TOUCHED DOWN FIRST, THEN THE MAINS. DURING THE LANDING ROLL, 
DIRECTIONAL CONTROL WAS LOST, AND THE AIRCRAFT GROUND LOOPED. THE 
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE TAIL WHEEL LEAF SPRINGS HAD FAILED. 
THERE WAS CORROSION ON ONE OF THE FRACTURE SURFACES; HOWEVER, 
METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE SPRINGS REVEALED THAT ALL FRACTURES 
WERE FROM OVERLOAD. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT ALL OF THE LEAF SPRINGS 
WERE NOT LOCATED; THEREFORE, A COMPLETE METALLURGICAL STUDY WAS NOT 
POSSIBLE. THE AIRCRAFT TOTAL TIME WAS 26 HOURS; HOWEVER, THE LEAF 
SPRINGS WERE INSTALLED IN A USED CONDITION, AND THE MAINTENANCE 
HISTORY OF THE SPRINGS WAS NOT AVAILABLE. 
THE OVERLOAD FAILURE OF THE TAIL WHEEL LEAF SPRINGS, WHICH RESULTED IN 
A LOSS OF DIRECTIONAL CONTROL DURING THE LANDING ROLL.
