A PICKUP TRUCK WAS POSITIONED AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY WITH ITS 
HEADLIGHTS ON TO GUIDE THE PILOT TO HIS UNLIGHTED PRIVATE STRIP. THE 
PILOT SAID HE WAS TOO LOW ON THE APPROACH, AND THE NOSE GEAR STRUCK THE 
TOP OF THE TRUCK CAB. THREE CHILDREN AND AN ADULT WERE SITTING IN THE 
TRUCK. A FOUR-YEAR-OLD CHILD RECEIVED SERIOUS HEAD INJURIES. THE 
AIRPLANE SUBSEQUENTLY MADE A WHEELS-UP LANDING. 
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE CLEARANCE FROM 
THE TRUCK DURING THE LANDING. FACTORS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE 
ACCIDENT WERE: THE PILOT'S POOR JUDGEMENT IN ATTEMPTING THE OPERATION, 
AND THE DRIVER'S POOR JUDGEMENT IN NOT VACATING ALL PERSONNEL FROM 
THE TRUCK.
