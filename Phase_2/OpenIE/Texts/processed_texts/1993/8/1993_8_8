THE PILOT WAS FLYING HIS FLOAT EQUIPPED AIRPLANE ALONG THE NORTHERN 
SHORE OF LAKE MICHIGAN. HE OBSERVED LOWERING CEILINGS AND FOG OVER THE 
LAKE, AND GAVE A PILOT REPORT TO A FSS OF CLEAR AIR OVER LAND. HE 
CONTINUED TOWARDS HIS DESTINATION AND FLEW INTO THE DETERIORATING 
WEATHER. THE PASSENGER STATED THAT THE PILOT ELECTED TO MAKE A 
PRECAUTIONARY LANDING IN THE LAKE BECAUSE OF THE REDUCED VISIBILITY AND 
LOW CEILING. SHE SAID THE WATER WAS ROUGH AND THE AIRPLANE LANDED 
HARD, DUG IN THE RIGHT FLOAT AND NOSED OVER. WITH THE PILOT'S ASSISTANCE, 
SHE WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE THE CABIN OF THE AIRPLANE THROUGH THE PASSENGER 
WINDOW AND SWIM TO THE SURFACE. SHE WENT BACK TO HELP THE PILOT (HER 
HUSBAND) BUT HE WAS STUCK HALF-WAY OUT THE WINDOW AND SHE COULD NOT 
FREE HIM. 
THE PILOT'S IMPROPER FLARE FOR LANDING. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
ACCIDENT ARE THE LOW CLOUDS AND FOG, THE ROUGH WATER AT THE LANDING 
SITE, AND THE PILOT'S CONTINUED FLIGHT INTO KNOWN ADVERSE WEATHER.
