APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES FROM THE PLANNED DESTINATION,  AND 2 HOURS 
AND 5 MINUTES AFTER DEPARTURE, A TOTAL LOSS  OF ENGINE POWER OCCURRED. 
DURING THE FORCED LANDING  TO AN UNEVEN FIELD, THE NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED. 
AN ON  SITE EXAMINATION OF THE FUEL SYSTEM REVEALED THAT THE  LEFT FUEL 
TANK DID NOT CONTAIN FUEL AND THE RIGHT FUEL  TANK CONTAINED LESS THAN 
ONE GALLON OF FUEL. 
FUEL EXHAUSTION DUE TO THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO REFUEL.  A FACTOR WAS THE 
LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN FOR THE  FORCED LANDING.
