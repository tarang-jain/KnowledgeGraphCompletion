 THIS WAS THE FIRST FLIGHT OF THE DAY AND THE TEMPERATURE WAS BELOW 
FREEZING.  THE PILOT PRIMED THE ENGINE SEVERAL TIMES AND THEN ATTEMPTED 
TO START THE ENGINE.  IT RAN FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN STOPPED.  HE 
PRIMED IT SEVERAL TIMES AGAIN AND THEN ATTEMPTED ANOTHER START.  AGAIN 
THE ENGINE STARTED AND THEN STOPPED.  HE THEN NOTICED A GLOW ON THE 
GROUND AND EVACUATED THE PASSENGERS WHILE HE ATTEMPTED TO CRANK THE 
ENGINE, HOWEVER THE FLAMES SPREAD, AND THE PILOT EVACUATED THE 
AIRPLANE.  THE MASTER SWITCH, ELECTRIC FUEL PUMP, MIXTURE CONTROL AND 
THE FUEL SELECTOR VALVE WERE LEFT ON.  ACCORDING TO THE AIRPLANE FLIGHT 
MANUAL, PRIMING IS USED ONLY AFTER THE INITIAL START ATTEMPT.  IN 
ADDITION, IF A FIRE OCCURS DURING START, THE MANUAL SAY TO SHUT OFF THE 
MIXTURE AND FUEL SELECTOR. THE PILOT HAD 90 HOURS TOTAL TIME. 
 THE PILOT'S IMPROPER EMERGENCY PROCEDURES FOR AN ENGINE FIRE DURING 
STARTING WHICH RESULTED IN THE SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.  FACTORS RELATED TO 
THE ACCIDENT WERE THE PILOT'S IMPROPER STARTING PROCEDURE AND HIS LACK 
OF TOTAL EXPERIENCE.
