THE AIRCRAFT WAS DESIGNED AND USED AS THE COMPANY'S ENGINEERING TEST BED. AN 
EVALUATION OF THE FLY-BY-WIRE RUDDER ACTUATOR AND GROUND MINIMUM 
CONTROL SPEED (VMCG) WAS BEING CONDUCTED. DURING THE FINAL HI-SPEED 
GROUND TEST RUN, THE AIRCRAFT ABRUPTLY VEERED LEFT AND BECAME AIRBORNE. IT 
ENTERED A LEFT TURN, CLIMBED TO ABOUT 250 FT, DEPARTED CONTROLLED FLIGHT AND 
IMPACTED THE GRND. INVESTIGATION REVEALED A DESIGN FEATURE IN THE 
RUDDER ACTUATOR THAT REMOVES HYD PRESSURE WITHIN THE ACTUATOR IF THE 
RUDDER POSITION COMMANDED BY THE PILOT EXCEEDED THE ACTUAL RUDDER 
ACTUATOR POSITION FOR A SPECIFIED TIME, AND THE RUDDER AERODYNAMICALLY 
TRAILS. THE ACTUATOR PREVIOUSLY DISENGAGED IN FLIGHT. THE COMPANY DID NOT 
CONDUCT A SYSTEM SAFETY REVIEW OF THE RUDDER BYPASS FEATURE AND ITS 
CONSEQUENCES TO ALL FLIGHT REGIMES, NOR OF THE VMCG TEST. THE FLIGHT TEST PLAN 
SPECIFIED THAT ENGINE POWER BE RETARDED IF THE RUDDER BECAME 
INEFFECTIVE. NEITHER PILOT HAD RECEIVED TRAINING AS AN EXPERIMENTAL TEST 
PILOT. THE COMPANY ALLOWED EXPERIMENTAL FLIGHT TESTS AT A CONFINED, 
METROPOLITAN ARPT. 
DISENGAGEMENT OF THE RUDDER FLY-BY-WIRE FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM 
RESULTING IN A TOTAL LOSS OF RUDDER CONTROL CAPABILITY WHILE 
CONDUCTING GROUND MINIMUM CONTROL SPEED TESTS. THE DISENGAGEMENT 
WAS A RESULT OF THE INADEQUATE DESIGN OF THE RUDDER'S INTEGRATED 
ACTUATOR PACKAGE BY ITS MANUFACTURER; THE OPERATOR'S INSUFFICIENT 
SYSTEM SAFETY REVIEW FAILED TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE 
INADEQUATE DESIGN TO ALL OPERATING REGIMES. A FACTOR WHICH 
CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE FLIGHT CREW'S LACK OF ENGINEERING 
FLIGHT TEST TRAINING.
