 AT THE END OF A LOCAL PLEASURE FLIGHT, THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE FIRST 
TOUCH AND GO WAS UNEVENTFUL. DURING THE SECOND LANDING, AFTER 
TOUCHDOWN, THE AIRPLANE VEERED SHARPLY TO THE LEFT.  THE PILOT APPLIED 
FULL RIGHT RUDDER AND PARTIAL BRAKE; HOWEVER, THE AIRPLANE CONTINUED 
TO THE LEFT AND EXITED THE SIDE OF THE RUNWAY, COLLIDING WITH A TAXIWAY 
SIGN BEFORE COMING TO REST.  AFTER THE ACCIDENT, THE TAILWHEEL ASSEMBLY 
WAS FOUND LOCKED IN AN OFFSET POSITION. DURING THE INSPECTION, IT WAS 
FOUND THAT A BOTTOM PLATE WAS ASSEMBLED INCORRECTLY AND WAS OUTSIDE 
OF A KEYWAY. 
 MOVEMENT OF THE TAILWHEEL ASSEMBLY WAS RESTRICTED.  IMPROPER 
MAINTENANCE WAS A FACTOR.
