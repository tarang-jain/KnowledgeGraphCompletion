 THE PILOT STATED WHEN HE LANDED ON THE SNOW-COVERED AIRSTRIP, IT 
APPEARED THE SNOW WAS 'HARD PACKED.'  HE REPORTED AS THE AIRPLANE 
DECELERATED, IT BEGAN TO SINK INTO THE SNOW, THEN NOSED OVER.  HE STATED: 
'IN THE THIRTY EIGHT YEARS OF FLYING THIS IS MY FIRST ACCIDENT.  SOMETIMES 
WE MAKE BAD DECISIONS AND THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE TIMES.'  FAA PERSONNEL 
REPORTED 8 INCHES OF SNOW ON THE RUNWAY. 
THE PILOT SELECTED UNSUITABLE TERRAIN FOR LANDING. THE SNOW COVERED 
RUNWAY WAS A FACTOR.
