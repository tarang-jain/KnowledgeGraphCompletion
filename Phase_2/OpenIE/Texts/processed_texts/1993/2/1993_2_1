THE STUDENT PILOT WAS MAKING A FULL FLAP SOFT FIELD LANDING WHEN A GUST 
OF WIND MOVED THE AIRPLANE OFF THE RUNWAY AND ONTO GRASS DURING THE 
FLARE. THE PILOT RAISED THE FLAPS AND ADDED FULL POWER TO TAKE OFF FROM 
THE DENSE GRASS. HE THEN ABORTED THE TAKEOFF ATTEMPT AND THE AIRPLANE 
COLLIDED WITH A FENCE AND SEVERAL TREES. 
THE STUDENT PILOT'S INADEQUATE COMPENSATION FOR THE GUSTY CROSSWIND, 
AND HIS IMPROPER DECISION TO ATTEMPT A TAKEOFF AFTER TOUCHING DOWN 
OFF THE RUNWAY SURFACE. FACTORS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT 
WAS THE GUSTING WIND CONDITION AND THE HIGH GRASS.
