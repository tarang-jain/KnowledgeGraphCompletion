SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF, BOTH ENGINES LOST POWER. THE PILOT SAID HE 
SELECTED DIFFERENT FUEL TANKS, BUT COULD NOT RESTART THE ENGINES. HE 
SUBSEQUENTLY MADE A WHEELS-UP FORCED LANDING IN A FIELD BELOW HIS 
FLIGHT PATH. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE HAD PERFORMED A PREFLIGHT 
INSPECTION AND THAT THERE WAS 4.1 GALS IN BOTH THE FRONT LEFT AND RIGHT 
MAIN FUEL TANKS. EXAMINATION OF THE AIRPLANE AFTER THE ACCIDENT 
REVEALED A COMBINED TOTAL OF ABOUT 5 GALS IN THE FORWARD LEFT AND 
RIGHT TANKS. THE OTHER FOUR TANKS WERE EMPTY. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE 
HAD LOST TRACK OF THE FLIGHTS FLOWN THAT DAY AND DID NOT VISUALLY CHECK 
THE FUEL. HE ALSO STATED THAT HE '...RAN THE AIRPLANE OUT OF FUEL.' 
ACCORDING TO BEECH, ALL FUEL IN THE AIRPLANE IS USABLE EXCEPT FOR A 
COMBINED 6 GALS IN THE LEFT AND RIGHT FORWARD TANKS. 
INADEQUATE PREFLIGHT BY THE PILOT, WHICH RESULTED IN FUEL EXHAUSTION 
DUE TO AN INADEQUATE SUPPLY OF FUEL.
