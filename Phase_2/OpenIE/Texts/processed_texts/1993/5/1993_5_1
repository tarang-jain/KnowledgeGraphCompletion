THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE WAS USING ONLY THE LEFT SIDE OF THE GRAVEL 
RUNWAY FOR TAKEOFF BECAUSE IT '...WAS IN A LITTLE BETTER CONDITION' THAN 
THE RIGHT HALF OF THE RUNWAY WHICH WAS VERY WET AND SOFT FROM THE 
MELTING WINTER SNOW. DUE TO WET SPOTS ON THE LEFT SIDE, SOME OF THE LEFT 
EDGE CONE MARKERS HAD BEEN MOVED IN TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE 
RUNWAY, MAKING THE TAKEOFF AREA EVEN NARROWER. DURING LIFTOFF THE 
AIRPLANE WEATHERVANED DUE TO A CROSSWIND, AND THE LEFT HORIZONTAL 
STABILIZER AND ELEVATOR COLLIDED WITH ONE OF THE 3-FT HIGH RUNWAY EDGE 
RUBBER CONE MARKERS. THE RUNWAY HAD BEEN REOPENED 4/27 AFTER HAVING 
BEEN CLOSED FOR 10 DAYS BECAUSE OF THE MELTING SNOW. 
THE PILOT'S POOR JUDGEMENT IN ATTEMPTING A TAKEOFF FROM A NARROW, WET, 
SOFT GRAVEL RUNWAY WITH A CROSSWIND. THE RUNWAY CONDITIONS AND THE 
CROSSWIND WERE FACTORS IN THE ACCIDENT.
