THE PILOT ABORTED THE TAKEOFF FROM THE SOD STRIP WHEN THE AIRPLANE DID 
NOT APPEAR TO ACCELERATE SUFFICIENTLY TO EXECUTE A SAFE TAKEOFF.  THE 
AIRPLANE CONTINUED OFF THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY AND COLLIDED 
WITH TERRAIN. EXAMINATION OF THE AIRCRAFT FAILED TO DISCLOSE ANY 
MECHANICAL PROBLEMS, NOR DID THE PILOT REPORT AN AIRCRAFT PROBLEM.  
ACCORDING TO THE AIRCRAFT FLIGHT MANUAL, AT GROSS WEIGHT, 
APPROXIMATELY 2100 FEET OF RUNWAY IS NEEDED FOR A NORMAL TAKEOFF FROM 
A DRY SOD RUNWAY; THE RUNWAY WAS 3100 FEET LONG. 
THE PILOT'S INADEQUATE PREFLIGHT PLANNING WHICH RESULTED IN HIS FAILURE 
TO ABORT THE TAKEOFF WHEN SUFFICIENT RUNWAY WAS AVAILABLE.
