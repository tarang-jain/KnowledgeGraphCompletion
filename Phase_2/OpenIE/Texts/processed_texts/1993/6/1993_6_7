 THE ENGINE LOST POWER AT ABOUT 150 TO 200 FEET AGL, AND THE PILOT WAS 
UNABLE TO REACH A SUITABLE LANDING AREA.  THE AIRPLANE TOUCHED DOWN IN 
A FIELD, BOUNCED INTO THE AIR, AND FLEW INTO TREES.  POST ACCIDENT 
INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT FUEL WOULD NOT FLOW TO THE CARBURETOR 
WITH THE FUEL TURNED ON AND THE ELECTRIC BOOST PUMP ON.  
CONTAMINATION WAS FOUND IN THE CARBURETOR AND FUEL STRAINER.  THE 
PILOT USED AUTO GAS WHICH WAS PLACED INTO CANS AND THEN POURED INTO 
THE WING TANKS WITHOUT BEING RUN THROUGH A FILTER OR STRAINER.  
ACCORDING TO THE STC FOR AUTO GAS, WHEN REFUELING FROM CANS, THE FUEL 
SHOULD BE FILTERED OR RUN THROUGH A CHAMOIS. 
 WAS A POWER LOSS DUE TO FUEL CONTAMINATION, AFTER THE PILOT REFUELED 
FROM CANS AND DID NOT FILTER THE FUEL ACCORDING TO RECOMMENDATIONS.
