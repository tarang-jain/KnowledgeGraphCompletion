ANOTHER SCHOOL AIRPLANE HAD EARLIER MADE A FORCED LANDING IN A FIELD 
NEAR THE AIRPORT, AND SCHOOL PERSONNEL HAD TRAVELLED TO THE SITE OF 
THE DOWNED AIRPLANE. AS THEY WERE EXAMINING THE DOWNED AIRPLANE, 
THEY OBSERVED THIS AIRPLANE CIRCLING THE DOWNED AIRPLANE FROM 500 FEET 
AGL INITIALLY DOWN TO ABOUT 150 FEET AGL IN SLOW FLIGHT WHERE IT STALLED 
AND SPUN TO THE GROUND. 
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AIRSPEED WHILE MANEUVERING 
AT LOW ALTITUDE. A FACTOR WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE 
PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE ALTITUDE FROM WHICH A RECOVERY 
WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE.
