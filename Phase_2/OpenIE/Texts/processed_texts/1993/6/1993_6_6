AERIAL APPLICATION EXPERIENCE CONSISTED OF 5 HOURS, INCLUDING THE 
ACCIDENT FLIGHT.  TOTAL FLIGHT TIME IN TYPE AND MODEL WAS APPROXIMATELY 
7 HOURS. THE PILOT WAS OBSERVED FLYING SEVERAL APPLICATION RUNS PRIOR TO 
THE ACCIDENT.  THE AIRPLANE WAS OBSERVED FLYING UNDER POWER LINES 
DURING ONE OF THE RUNS.  DURING THE PULL UP, AT THE COMPLETION OF THE 
ACCIDENT RUN, A WITNESS OBSERVED THE AIRPLANE'S RIGHT WING STRIKE A 
TREE.  THE AIRPLANE STAGGERED, THEN NOSED OVER AND IMPACTED THE 
GROUND. 
 THE PILOT'S MISJUDGED CLEARANCE FROM OBSTACLES DURING AERIAL

FLYING.
