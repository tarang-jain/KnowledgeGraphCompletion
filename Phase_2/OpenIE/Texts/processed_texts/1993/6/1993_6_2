ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, WHILE ON APPROACH  TO THE DIMLY LIGHTED 
RUNWAY, HE DISCOVERED  THAT THE AIRCRAFT LANDING  LIGHT WOULD NOT  
COME ON. HIS RESEARCH OF THE PROBLEM DISCLOSED  THAT THE LANDING LIGHT 
CIRCUIT BREAKER HAD  POPPED, BUT AFTER RESETTING THE BREAKER,  THE 
LANDING LIGHT STILL FAILED TO OPERATE.  THE PILOT ELECTED TO CONTINUE THE 
APPROACH TO A LIGHTED AREA ON THE AIRPORT.  THE AIRPLANE TOUCHED DOWN 
IN THE GRASS  BETWEEN THE RUNWAY AND TAXIWAY, AND COLLIDED  WITH A 
DEPRESSION IN THE GRASSY AREA. 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO ESTABLISH A FINAL  APPROACH COURSE TO THE RUNWAY 
SURFACE  DURING A NIGHT LANDING. A FACTOR WAS THE INOPERATIVE AIRCRAFT 
LANDING LIGHT.
