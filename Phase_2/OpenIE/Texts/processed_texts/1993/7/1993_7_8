SUDDENLY TO THE LEFT AND BEGAN TO DEPART THE SIDE OF THE RUNWAY. WHILE 
DEPARTING THE RUNWAY, THE AIRCRAFT LIFTED OFF, BUT ACCORDING TO

SPEED. THE PILOT WAS OBSERVED TO MAKE NO MOVEMENT WHILE THE AIRCRAFT 
WAS AIRBORNE, AND HE DID NOT RESPOND ON HIS RADIO WHEN ANOTHER PILOT, 
WHO HAD MADE RADIO CONTACT WITH HIM JUST PRIOR TO THE TAKEOFF, 
TRANSMITTED A RADIO MESSAGE TO HIM TO SEE IF HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE. 
AN IN FLIGHT LOSS OF CONTOL FOR UNKNOWN REASONS.
