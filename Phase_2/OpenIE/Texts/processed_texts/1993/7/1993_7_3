SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF FROM A LAKE, AT ABOUT 40 FEET ABOVE THE LAKE'S 
SURFACE, THE AIRPLANE STALLED, THEN IMPACTED IN A NOSE DOWN ATTITUDE 
AND NOSED OVER.  POST-ACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE AIRFRAME AND ENGINE 
DID NOT REVEAL ANY ANOMALIES. THE AIRPLANE'S CARGO WEIGHED ABOUT 400 
POUNDS.  GROSS WEIGHT OF THE AIRPLANE WAS CALCULATED TO BE ABOUT 3450 
POUNDS, WHICH WAS ABOUT 630 POUNDS OVER ITS MAXIMUM GROSS WEIGHT 
LIMIT.  ALSO, AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF WATER WAS FOUND IN THE AFT 3 
COMPARTMENTS OF THE RIGHT FLOAT. 
THE PILOT'S INADEQUATE PREFLIGHT PLANNING/PREPARATION, HIS FAILURE TO 
ASSURE PROPER WEIGHT AND BALANCE OF THE AIRCRAFT FOR TAKEOFF, AND HIS 
FAILURE TO OBTAIN AND/OR MAINTAIN ADEQUATE AIRSPEED, WHICH RESULTED IN 
A STALL.  A POSSIBLE FACTOR RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WAS: WATER IN THE 
RIGHT FLOAT.
