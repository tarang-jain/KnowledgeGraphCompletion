 THE AIRPLANE DEPARTED A RESTRICTED LANDING AREA RUNWAY FOR A LOCAL 
FLIGHT. SHORTLY AFTER DEPARTING, AT 300 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND, THE 
AIRPLANE'S ENGINE STOPPED RUNNING.  THE PILOT PERFORMED A 180 DEGREE 
TURN TOWARD THE DEPARTURE RUNWAY. DURING THE TURN THE AIRPLANE 
STALLED AND SUBSEQUENTLY COLLIDED WITH THE GROUND.  THE AIRPLANE WAS 
DESTROYED BY A POST IMPACT FIRE.  THE ON-SCENE INVESTIGATION REVEALED A 
CARBURETOR FLOAT WITH MULTIPLE CRACKS IN IT.  LIQUID EMERSION OF THE 
FLOAT REVEALED LIQUID PENETRATION INTO THE FLOAT. THE LAST ANNUAL 
INSPECTION WAS PERFORMED 21 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. 
 THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AIRSPEED.  FACTORS 
CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WERE A CRACKED CARBURETOR FLOAT, FUEL 
STARVATION, AND THE FAILURE TO PERFORM AN ANNUAL INSPECTION.
