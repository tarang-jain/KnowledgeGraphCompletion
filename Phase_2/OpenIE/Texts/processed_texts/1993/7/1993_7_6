 WHILE ON A STUDENT SOLO CROSS COUNTRY TRAINING FLIGHT, THE ALTERNATOR 
FAILED AND THE STUDENT FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE FAILURE.  THE LORAN, 
WHICH HE WAS USING FOR NAVIGATION, FAILED SO HE SWITCHED TO THE VOR.  
THAT ALSO FAILED AND HE THEN NOTICED HIS FUEL GAUGES WERE LOW AND 
THOUGHT HE WAS RUNNING OUT OF FUEL.  THE STUDENT PILOT ATTEMPTED TO 
LAND ON A RURAL ROAD AND WENT OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD INTO A DITCH. THE 
FLIGHT DEPARTED WITH FULL FUEL WHICH PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY 4 HOURS 
AND 30 MINUTES ENDURANCE. THE ACTUAL DURATION OF THE FLIGHT WAS 1 HOUR 
AND 45 MINUTES. 
 FAILURE OF THE STUDENT PILOT TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT 
DURING LANDING ROLL.  FACTORS WERE:  ALTERNATOR FAILURE, FAILURE OF THE 
STUDENT PILOT TO FOLLOW PROCEDURES AND DIRECTIVES, AND FAILURE OF THE 
STUDENT PILOT TO PERFORM FUEL CONSUMPTION CALCULATIONS.
