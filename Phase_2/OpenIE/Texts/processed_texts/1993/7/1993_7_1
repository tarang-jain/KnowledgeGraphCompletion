 THE PILOT IN COMMAND SAID THAT HE BELIEVED THAT HE COMMENCED THE 
WATER TAKEOFF FROM THE GENERAL AREA ON THE LAKE THAT HE NORMALLY DID 
AND THAT THE TAKEOFF RUN, USING TWO NOTCHES OF FLAP, AND THE LIFT OFF 
POINT WERE ROUTINE.  NOT ALL OF THE AVAILABLE LAKE AREA WAS USED FOR THE 
TAKEOFF. THE PLANE CARRIED APPROXIMATELY 75 GALLONS OF FUEL, THE PILOT 
AND A PASSENGER, EACH WEIGHING UNDER 175 POUNDS, A FISHING TACKLE BOX 
AND A SMALL SURVIVAL BAG.  AS THE PLANE CLIMBED TO THE HEIGHT OF THE 
TREES AT THE RAPIDLY APPROACHING SHORELINE, HE ENCOUNTERED A GUST OF 
WIND WHICH REQUIRED A MOMENTARY FLIGHT CONTROL INPUT TO COUNTER.  HE 
DID NOT EXPERIENCE THE SENSATION THAT THE PLANE HAD ENCOUNTERED A 
DOWNDRAFT. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, HE REALIZED THAT HE DID NOT HAVE 
SUFFICIENT ALTITUDE TO CLEAR THE TREES. THE PILOT'S LOG BOOK SHOWED THAT 
PRIOR TO JULY 1993, HIS LAST FLIGHT IN N93018 OCCURRED IN JUNE 1992.  THE 
PILOT REPORTED THAT HE DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY DIFFICULTIES WITH THE 
PLANE'S ENGINE OR FLIGHT CONTROLS. 
THE PILOT IN COMMAND'S FAILURE TO USE ALL OF THE AVAILABLE RUNWAY 
(WATERWAY).  A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT IN COMMAND'S LACK OF 
RECENT EXPERIENCE IN THE TYPE OF OPERATION.
