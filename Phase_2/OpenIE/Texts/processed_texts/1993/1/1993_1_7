 DURING A TOUCH AND GO AT MID STATE AIRPORT, UPON TOUCH DOWN AND 
LOWERING OF THE AIRPLANE'S NOSE ON RUNWAY 24, THE STUDENT PILOT AND CFI 
NOTICED A SNOW BANK ACROSS THE RUNWAY AT THE INTERSECTION OF RUNWAY 
16/34.  THE CFI INSTRUCTED THE STUDENT TO TAKEOFF IMMEDIATELY.  THE 
STUDENT APPLIED FULL TAKEOFF POWER, AND JUST AFTER LIFT OFF THEY HEARD 
A 'THUMP'.  THE AIRPLANE'S LEFT MAIN GEAR IMPACTED THE SNOW BANK AND WAS 
TORN AWAY FROM THE AIRPLANE CAUSING SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE TO THE 
HORIZONTAL STABILIZER AND LEFT WING AND FLAP.  THE STUDENT AND CFI 
CONTINUED THE TAKEOFF AND RETURNED TO THEIR BASE AIRPORT WHERE A FLY 
BY WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND A DAMAGE ASSESSMENT WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY 
GROUND PERSONNEL.  THE CFI MADE AN EMERGENCY LANDING AND THE AIRPLANE 
OCCUPANTS EXITED THE AIRPLANE WITH NO REPORTED INJURIES.  THE CFI STATED 
THAT THEY DID FLY OVER MID STATE AIRPORT PRIOR TO LANDING AND THAT THEY 
DID NOT SEE ANYTHING ON THE RUNWAY. THE MANAGER OF MID STATE AIRPORT 
REPORTED THAT THE PERSON WHO SNOW PLOWED RUNWAY 16/34 WAS NEW TO 
THE AIRPORT AND WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE OTHER RUNWAY WAS IN USE, 
HENCE, DID NOT REMOVE THE PLOWED SNOW FROM THE INTERSECTING RUNWAY.  
THERE WERE NO NOTICES TO AIRMEN PUBLISHED CONCERNING A CLOSURE OF 
RUNWAY 24. 
 THE INADEQUATE REMOVAL OF SNOW FROM THE RUNWAYS BY AIRPORT 
PERSONNEL AND THE PROCEDURES/DIRECTIVES FOR AIRPORT SNOW REMOVAL 
NOT UNDERSTOOD.
