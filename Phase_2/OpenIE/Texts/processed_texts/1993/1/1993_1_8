DURING THE APPROACH, THE 1ST OFFICER (FO) ASKED THE CAPT IF HE WANTED TO 
'...POP THE BOOTS?' TO REMOVE ICE OFF THE WINGS. THE CAPT RESPONDED '...IT'S 
GOING TO THE HANGAR. I'LL RUN'EM ON THE GROUND...' THE FO RETARDED POWER 
OVER THE THRESHOLD AND THE SINK RATE INCREASED; THE CAPT OBSERVED 900 
FPM. THE FO APPLIED ADDITIONAL BACK PRESSURE ON THE YOKE, BUT IT WAS 
INADEQUATE TO ARREST THE HIGH SINK RATE. ADDITIONAL BACK PRESSURE WAS 
APPLIED, AND THE STALL HORN SOUNDED FOLLOWED SHORTLY THEREAFTER BY 
THE CAPT STATING 'I GOT IT.' DURING THE HARD LANDING THE RIGHT MAIN 
LANDING GEAR BROKE, THE FUEL TANK RUPTURED, AND THE RIGHT WING REAR 
SPAR BENT UPWARD. APPROXIMATELY 18 HRS AFTER THE ACCIDENT, 3/16 INCH OF RIME MIXED 
WITH CLEAR ICE WAS OBSERVED ON THE LEADING EDGES OF THE WING, HORIZ 
STAB, AND VERT STAB. THE ICE HAD FINGER-LIKE PROTRUSIONS POSITIONED 
VERTICALLY TO THE WING SURFACES. THE COMPANY'S LINE OPS MANUAL DOES NOT 
DISCUSS FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS OR LANDING TECHNIQUES SPECIFIC TO WING 
ICE. NEITHER PILOT HAD RECEIVED COMPANY'S CURRENT CRM TRAINING. 
THE FIRST OFFICER'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN A PROPER DESCENT RATE DURING THE 
LANDING, AND THE CAPTAIN'S INADEQUATE SUPERVISION BY NOT TAKING TIMELY 
ACTION TO ENSURE A SAFE LANDING. FACTORS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE 
ACCIDENT WERE: THE COMPANY'S FAILURE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE TRAINING ON 
THE AIRPLANE'S FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS AND/OR HANDLING TECHNIQUES 
UNDER CONDITIONS OF WING ICE CONTAMINATION, THE COMPANY'S FAILURE TO 
ASSURE THAT BOTH PILOTS HAD RECEIVED THE CURRENT CREW RESOURCE 
MANAGEMENT (CRM) TRAINING, AND THE EXISTING WEATHER CONDITIONS WHICH 
RESULTED IN AN ACCUMULATION OF ICE ON THE AIRPLANE'S WING.
