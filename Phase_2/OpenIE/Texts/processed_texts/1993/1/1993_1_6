 ABOUT 30 MINUTES INTO THE LOCAL FLIGHT, THE PRIVATE PILOT REPORTED THAT 
TOTAL ELECTRICAL POWER WAS LOST. HE COULD NOT LOWER THE FLAPS, AND 
WHEN HE LOWERED THE GEAR HANDLE, NO GREENS LIGHTS ILLUMINATED. HE 
ELECTED TO RAISE THE GEAR HANDLE AND LAND. THE AIRCRAFT WAS 
STRUCTURALLY DAMAGED DURING THE LANDING. WHEN THE AIRCRAFT WAS 
REMOVED FROM THE RUNWAY, AN FBO EMPLOYEE LOWERED THE GEAR HANDLE, 
AND THE GEAR EXTENDED AND LOCKED. HE THEN TURNED ON THE MASTER 
SWITCH, AND OBSERVED 3 GREEN GEAR DOWN LIGHTS ILLUMINATED. THE PILOT 
REPORTED THAT HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THE MANUAL ALTERNATE GEAR 
EXTENSION METHOD. THE PILOT ALSO REPORTED THAT THE LOSS OF ELECTRICAL 
POWER COULD HAVE RESULTED FROM HIS FAILURE TO TURN ON THE GENERATORS 
DURING THE FLIGHT. 
 THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO FOLLOW CHECKLIST PROCEDURES IN THAT HE DID NOT 
UTILIZE THE ALTERNATE GEAR EXTENSION METHOD WHEN ELECTRICAL POWER 
WAS LOST. A FACTOR WAS HIS FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE CHECKLIST WHEN HE 
FAILED TO TURN ON THE GENERATORS PRIOR TO FLIGHT, WHICH RESULTED IN 
ELECTRICAL FAILURE.
