 AFTER TAKEOFF FOLLOWING THE THIRD TOUCH AND GO LANDING ON RUNWAY 36, 
DURING THE DOWNWIND LEG WHERE THE FLIGHT WAS ABOUT 1 MILE WEST OF THE 
DEPARTURE RUNWAY, THE STUDENT ADVISED THE CFI THAT HE SMELLED SOMETHING 
BURNING AND THAT THE ENG WASN'T PRODUCING POWER.  THE CFI ADVANCED AND 
RETARDED THE THROTTLE AND OBSERVED THAT THE MANIFOLD PRESSURE NEEDLE 
MOVEMENT FOLLOWED THE THROTTLE MOVEMENT, THEN GAVE CONTROL OF THE 
AIRCRAFT BACK TO THE STUDENT.  THE STUDENT AGAIN STATED THAT THE ENG WASN'T 
PRODUCING POWER AND THE CFI TOOK CONTROL, TURNED TO THE EAST TO LAND ON 
A TAXIWAY, AND LANDED HARD SHORT OF THE TAXIWAY. FUEL QUANTITY WAS 
SUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN ENG OPERATION AND THE FUEL SUPPLY DID NOT CONTAIN 
CONTAMINANTS. THE ENG WAS STARTED AFTER THE ACCIDENT AND OPERATED ONLY 
TO 1,500 RPM DUE TO DAMAGE TO THE PROPELLER ASSY. THE ENG WAS THEN SENT 
TO THE MANUFACTURER'S FACILITY OPERATED WITH THE ONLY DISCREPANCY 
NOTED THAT THE FUEL FLOW AT 80 PPH WAS 9 PPH LEANER THAN SPECIFICATION. 
NO DETERMINATION COULD BE MADE AS TO THE REASON FOR THE LOSS OF ENG 
POWER. 
 LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DURING THE DOWNWIND LEG FOR UNDETERMINED 
REASONS, POOR IN-FLIGHT PLANNING/DECISION BY THE DUAL STUDENT, AND 
INADEQUATE SUPERVISION BY THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND (CFI).
