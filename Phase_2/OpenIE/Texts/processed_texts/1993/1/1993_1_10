 THE AIRPLANE WAS IN CRUISE FLIGHT AT ABOUT 9,500 FEET MEAN SEA LEVEL 
WHEN THE ENGINE HAD A TOTAL LOSS OF POWER.  THE PILOT ENTERED A POWER 
OFF FORCED LANDING AND PERFORMED EMERGENCY PROCEDURES ATTEMPTING 
TO RE START THE ENGINE.  HE COULD NOT GET THE ENGINE STARTED.  THE PILOT 
LANDED THE AIRPLANE ON A TWO LANE ROAD ADJACENT TO AN INTERSTATE 
HIGHWAY. THE PILOT ENCOUNTERED AN UNFAVORABLE LEFT CROSSWIND WHICH 
CAUSED THE AIRPLANE TO DRIFT TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD. DURING 
LANDING ROLL THE AIRPLANE'S RIGHT WING CONTACTED METAL FENCE POSTS AND 
SPUN THE AIRPLANE INTO AN EMBANKMENT. DURING AN FAA SUPERVISED ENGINE 
RUN FUEL WAS NOTED AS LEAKING FROM THE CARBURETOR.  AN EXAMINATION OF 
THE CARBURETOR REVEALED THAT THE INLET FUEL FITTING HAD GALLED OR 
CROSSFED THREADS.  METAL SHAVINGS FROM THE THREADS BYPASSED THE FUEL 
SCREEN AND TRAVELED DIRECTLY INTO THE FUEL FLOAT VALVE WITHOUT GOING 
THROUGH THE FILTER SCREEN.  THIS CAUSED THE FLOAT VALVE TO BECOME 
INOPERATIVE, WHICH RESULTED IN FLOODING THE ENGINE WITH FUEL CAUSING A 
TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER.  THE AIRPLANE'S ENGINE HAD A TOTAL TIME OF 7 
HOURS SINCE OVERHAUL. 
 1) THE CARBURETOR INLET FUEL LINE BEING IMPROPERLY INSTALLED BY 
MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL WHICH ALLOWED THE CARBURETOR TO BECOME 
CONTAMINATED WITH METAL PARTICLES, AND 2) THE CARBURETOR FLOAT VALVE 
BEING JAMMED BY METAL PARTICLES WHICH ALLOWED EXCESSIVE FUEL TO BE 
INTRODUCED INTO THE CARBURETOR RESULTING IN FLOODING AND THE TOTAL 
LOSS OF ENGINE POWER. A FACTOR IN THIS ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT 
ENCOUNTERING AN UNFAVORABLE CROSSWIND DURING FINAL APPROACH WHICH 
LED TO THE AIRPLANE'S WING COLLIDING WITH FENCE POSTS DURING LANDING 
ROLL.
