The pilot reported that while cruising at 3,800 feet mean sea level he suddenly detected a 'very 
strong smell of aviation gasoline and the engine stopped running.'  The pilot attempted to 
restart the engine, but was not successful. The pilot further reported that he did not have 
sufficient altitude to glide to any airport, so he made an emergency landing in a nearby river 
bed.  During rollout, the airplane collided with vegetation.  An examination of the engine 
revealed it had stopped as a result of being flooded with excessive fuel.  The cause of the 
flooding related to the improper functioning of the carburetor's needle valve pin. 
was the failure of the needle valve pin assembly in the airplane's carburetor.  A factor which 
contributed to the accident was the lack of suitable terrain for the emergency landing.
