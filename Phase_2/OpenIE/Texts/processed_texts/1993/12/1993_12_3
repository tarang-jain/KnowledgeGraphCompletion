THE PILOT OF AN AGRICULTURAL AIRPLANE EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF ENGINE 
POWER WHILE THE AIRPLANE WAS ON INITIAL TAKEOFF CLIMB. THE PILOT STATED 
THAT DUE TO HIS LOW AIRSPEED AND ALTITUDE, HE ELECTED TO LAND STRAIGHT 
AHEAD IN AN OPEN WHEAT FIELD. THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER AS THE MAIN 
LANDING GEAR TIRES DUG INTO THE SOFT GROUND, AND THE AIRPLANE CAME TO 
REST IN THE INVERTED POSITION. A DETAILED EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE AND 
ITS COMPONENTS FAILED TO PRODUCE ANY MECHANICAL PROBLEM THAT WOULD 
HAVE PREVENTED NORMAL ENGINE OPERATION. 
THE TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS. A FACTOR WAS 
THE LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN AVAILABLE TO THE PILOT FOR THE FORCED 
LANDING.
