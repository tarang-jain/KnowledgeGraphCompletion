THE PILOT STATED THAT THE AIRPLANE STARTED TO WEATHERVANE WHILE 
TURNING OFF THE RUNWAY ONTO THE TAXIWAY. NOSEWHEEL STEERING WAS 
INITIATED WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS. FULL POWER WAS APPLIED ON THE THRUST 
REVERSERS; THE AIRPLANE DEPARTED THE TAXIWAY AND CAME TO A STOP IN THE 
GRASS. THE PILOT THEN TAXIED FORWARD, AND THE NOSEWHEEL COLLIDED WITH 
A CEMENT PAD COLLAPSING THE NOSE GEAR. EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT THE 
LEFT HAND MAIN GEAR ASSEMBLY TRAILING LINK CONNECTORS PW21 AND PW 23 
ANTI-SKID TRANSDUCERS WERE CROSSED, AND RESPONDED OPPOSITE OF HOW 
THEY SHOULD HAVE OPERATED. 
THE PIC'S IMPROPER DECISION TO TAXI THE AIRPLANE OFF THE TAXIWAY. 
CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE IMPROPER WIRING OF THE ANTI-SKID 
SYSTEM.
