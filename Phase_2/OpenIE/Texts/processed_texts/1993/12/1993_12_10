THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH TREES ON A HILL, ABOUT 1/2 MILE FROM THE 
AIRPORT (LEB). THE ACCIDENT SITE WAS ABOUT 250 FEET ABOVE THE AIRPORT 
ELEVATION. THE PILOT WAS ON A CLEARANCE, IN PART, TO CLIMB TO 6000 FEET; HE 
WAS IN RADIO CONTACT WITH THE LEB TOWER CONTROLLER. THE CONTROLLER 
REPORTED HE NOTICED THE AIRPLANE HAD TURNED TOO FAR LEFT AFTER 
TAKEOFF AND IT WAS HEADED TOWARD A HILL. HE ASKED THE PILOT IF HAD HAD 
THE HILL IN SIGHT, AND THE PILOT RESPONDED 'SAY AGAIN.'  THE SURVIVING 
PASSENGER REPORTED HE OVERHEARD THE CONTROLLER CALLING THE PILOT TO 
ALERT HIM OF THE HILL AND THEREAFTER THE COLLISION OCCURRED. A SECOND 
PILOT WAS ABOARD, AS A SAFETY PILOT; HE WAS AN INSTRUMENT RATED FLIGHT 
INSTRUCTOR. ALTHOUGH BOTH PILOTS HAD PREVIOUSLY DEPARTED THE AIRPORT 
SEVERAL TIMES, ACCORDING TO THEIR LOGBOOKS, THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT WAS 
THEIR FIRST NIGHT DEPARTURE FROM THE AIRPORT. THE DEPARTURE PROCEDURE 
FOR THE AIRPORT, IN PART STATES, '...CLIMB VISUALLY OVER AIRPORT, TO CROSS 
THE AIRPORT AT OR ABOVE 1500 FEET, THEN PROCEED ON COURSE.' 
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate terrain clearance which resulted in an inflight collision 
with the terrain.  A factor was a dark night condition.
