EN ROUTE AT FL 240, THE PLANE ENTERED A LEFT SPIRALING DESCENT AND 
SUBSEQUENTLY EXPERIENCED AN INFLIGHT BREAK-UP AT 7000' WITH SEPARATION 
OF OUTBOARD WINGS, TAIL SECTIONS AND INTERNAL VINYL FROM THE NOSE 
BAGGAGE DOOR.  THERE WAS NO DISTRESS CALL.  WITNESSES HEARD THE ENGINES 
AND AN EXPLOSIVE SOUND, THEN THEY SAW THE PLANE IN A SPIN, TRAILED BY 
FALLING DEBRIS. DEBRIS WAS STREWN OVER A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 3.5 MI.  LIGHT 
WEIGHT PIECES INCLUDING VINYL FROM THE BAGGAGE DOOR, WING SKIN, AND TAIL 
SKIN PIECES WERE AMONG THE 1ST DEBRIS ON THE WRECKAGE PATH. TAIL 
SECTIONS WERE FOUND ABOUT 2.5 MI FROM THE MAIN WRECKAGE WITH EVIDENCE 
OF OVERLOAD FAILURE; PIECES OF THE WINGS WERE FOUND WITH EVIDENCE OF 
DOWNWARD/OVERLOAD SEP- ARATION.  NO PREEXISTING AIRFRAME FAILURE WAS 
FOUND THAT WOULD HAVE LED TO LOSS OF CONTROL, INFLIGHT BREAKUP, LOSS OF 
PRESSURIZATION OR HYPOXIA. THE PLANE WAS INACTIVE FOR ABOUT 2 YRS BEFORE 
BEING PURCHASED 2 MONTHS BEFORE ACCIDENT. LAST ANNUAL INSPECTION WAS 
ON 6/8/92.  ICING WAS FORECAST FROM 9000' TO 17,000'MSL; TURBULENCE WAS 
FORECAST BELOW 8000' MSL. 
THE PILOT'S LOSS OF AIRCRAFT CONTROL FOR AN UNKNOWN REASON, AND 
SUBSEQUENT FLIGHT THAT EXCEEDED THE DESIGN STRESS LIMITS OF THE 
AIRPLANE, WHICH RESULTED IN AN IN-FLIGHT AIRFRAME BREAKUP.
