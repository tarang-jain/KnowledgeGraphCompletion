THE PILOT COULD NOT ACTIVATE THE RUNWAY LIGHTS DURING A NIGHT LANDING.  
HE MADE TWO PASSES OVER THE RUNWAY TO SEE IF THE RUNWAY WAS CLEAR.  HE 
THEN ELECTED TO LAND ON THE RUNWAY WITHOUT THE RUNWAY LIGHTS 
AVAILABLE.  HE HAD COMPLETED THE LANDING AND DURING THE ROLL OUT THE 
LEFT HORIZONTAL STABILIZER STRUCK THE VASI LIGHT. 
the pilot's improper inflight decision to conduct a night landing at an airport without runway 
lights, and the subsequent misalignment with the runway and collision with an object.
