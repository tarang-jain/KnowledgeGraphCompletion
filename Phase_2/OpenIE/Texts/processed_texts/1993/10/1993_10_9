RADAR DATA SHOWED THE AIRPLANE WAS CRUISING AT ABOUT 7500' MSL AND 190 KTS 
GROUND SPEED AND TRACKING ABOUT 140 DEGREES, WHEN IT BEGAN TO DESCEND.  
THE LAST RECORDED ALTITUDE WAS ABOUT 6500' MSL.  WITNESSES HEARD A LOUD 
NOISE, THEN SAW THE AIRPLANE AND DEBRIS FROM THE PLANE FALLING TO THE 
GROUND.  THEY WERE UNABLE TO JUDGE THE AIRPLANE'S ALTITUDE WHEN IT 
BROKE UP.  WRECKAGE WAS SCATTERED OVER A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 1.3 MILES.  AN 
EXAM REVEALED THE V-TAIL STABILIZERS AND WINGS HAD SEPARATED IN FLIGHT.  
THERE WAS EVIDENCE THE STABILIZERS HAD FAILED IN A DOWNWARD DIRECTION.  
THE RIGHT WING SEPARATED FROM THE FUSELAGE AT THE WING ROOT, AND THE 
LEFT WING HAD SEPARATED IN 3 MAIN PIECES; THERE WAS EVIDENCE ON THE 
FRONT SPAR CARRY-THROUGH STRUCTURE THAT THE WINGS HAD FAILED IN A 
DOWNWARD DIRECTION.  BOTH FRONT SEAT BELTS WERE INTACT, BUT 
UNLAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLHED, WITH NO EVIDENCE OF DEFORMATION; THE PILOT WAS THROWN 
FROM THE AIRPLANE DURING THE ACCIDENT. NO PRE-ACCIDENT ANOMALIES OF 
THE AIRFRAME WERE FOUND. 
IN-FLIGHT BREAKUP OF THE AIRPLANE FOR AN UNDETERMINED REASON.
