The front and then rear engines lost partial power during initial climb from the Ryan Field near 
Tucson, Arizona. Unable to continue climbing, the pilot made a forced landing in rough terrain 
about two miles east of the airport.  An examination of the airplane's fuel system revealed two 
of the front engine's six fuel injectors were partially clogged with a foreign substance.  No 
clogging of the rear injectors was found.  Prior to the accident (ferry) flight, the airplane had 
been idle for several years.  In preparation for the flight, recent maintenance which included 
limited purging of the fuel system had reportedly been accomplished by contractor 
maintenance personnel. 
was the partial loss of engine power during initial climb due to partial clogging of the engine's
