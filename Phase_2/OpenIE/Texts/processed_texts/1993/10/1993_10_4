The pilot reported that he had just purchased the airplane, and the accident occurred during 
his familiarization flight.  The pilot took off and, along with the previous owner, flew to a local 
practice area.  The previous owner demonstrated airwork and then demonstrated a takeoff and 
a landing.  According to the pilot, he then attempted to land the airplane.  During his first 
approach, he 'waved off.'  The pilot further reported that during his second approach he was 
low.  The pilot added full engine power, and the airplane's main landing gear collided with the 
airport's perimeter fence short of the runway.  The pilot had not flown any airplane during the 
previous 90 days.  Also, he had no previous piloting experience in the accident make and model 
airplane. 
was the pilot's failure to maintain an adequate approach path to the runway and his inadequate 
altitude.  Contributing factors were the pilot's delayed remedial action and his lack of recent 
experience in the airplane.
