THE PILOT WAS PERFORMING HIS FIRST WHEEL LANDING IN THE AIRPLANE. 
DURING THE LANDING, THE AIRPLANE BOUNCED TWICE AND TURNED ABOUT 40 
DEGREES TO THE LEFT OF THE RUNWAY CENTERLINE.  DURING THE GO-AROUND 
ATTEMPT PERFORMED BY THE PILOT, THE PLANE COLLIDED WITH TREES. 
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND DID NOT MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL OF THE 
AIRPLANE.  A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT WERE THE TREES ADJACENT TO THE SIDE 
OF THE RUNWAY.
