THE AIRPLANE WAS FLOWN ON A CHECK FLIGHT AFTER MAINTENANCE FOR AN OIL-
AND-FILTER CHANGE AND REPLACEMENT OF LEAKING GASKETS.  DURING THE 
INITIAL CLIMB AFTER TAKEOFF, THE PILOT NOTED A MOMENTARY LOSS OF POWER, 
PROMPTING A TURN TOWARDS THE AIRPORT.  THE ENGINE LOST ALL POWER IN THE 
TURN.  DURING A LANDING SHORT OF THE RUNWAY, THE AIRPLANE HIT A FENCE. 
THE MAIN FUEL LINE CONNECTION TO THE FUEL PUMP WAS FOUND LOOSE.  WHEN 
THE BOOST PUMP WAS ENERGIZED, THE LOOSE FITTING LEAKED SUBSTANTIALLY. 
A LOOSE FUEL LINE FITTING, DUE TO IMPROPER MAINTENANCE, WHICH RESULTED 
IN AN INTERUPTION OF FUEL TO THE ENGINE.
