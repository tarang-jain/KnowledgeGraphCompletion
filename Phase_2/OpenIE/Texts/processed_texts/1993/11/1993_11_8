THE PILOT AND HIS PASSENGER WERE RETURNING HOME ON A NIGHT, VFR, BUSINESS 
FLIGHT.  WITNESSES REPORTED THAT LOW CEILINGS AND FOG PREVAILED.  
SUBSEQUENTLY, THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH TREES AND TERRAIN ABOUT 2 MI 
SOUTH-SOUTHEAST OF THE DESTINATION (A VFR-ONLY AIRPORT).  THE WRECKAGE 
PATH WAS ABOUT 500' IN LENGTH. THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT INITIAL IMPACT 
WAS IN A LEFT DESCENDING TURN.  NO PREIMPACT PART FAILURE OR 
MALFUNCTION OF THE AIRPLANE WAS FOUND. A TOXICOLOGY CHECK OF THE 
PILOT'S BLOOD SHOWED 6.114 UG/ML OF CHLORPHENIRAMINE, 0.272 UG/ML OF 
DIPHENHYDRAMINE, 13.5 UG/ML OF ACETAMINOPHEN, 30 MG/DL OF 
ACETALDEHYDE, AND 10.3 UG/ML OF SALICYLATE (ASPIRIN).  ALSO, 0.61 UG/ML OF 
HYDROCODONE WAS DETECTED IN THE PILOT'S BILE. AN AVIATION MEDICAL 
EXAMINER (AME) REPORTED THE PILOT HAD SUFFERED FROM ALLERGIES AND 
DEPRESSION.  THE AME WAS ALSO THE PILOT'S PERSONAL PHYSICAN AND PART 
OWNER OF THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE. HE HAD REPEATEDLY PRESCRIBED 
MEDICATIONS TO THE PILOT, AS THOSE FOUND DURING THE TOXICOLOGY TESTS, 
THAT WERE NOT APPROVED FOR USE WHILE OPERATING AN AIRCRAFT. 
THE PILOT'S IMPAIRED JUDGEMENT AND PERFORMANCE BY FLYING WHILE UNDER 
THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS, THAT RESULTED IN HIS CONTINUATION OF VFR FLIGHT 
AT NIGHT IN INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS (IMC) AND HIS FAILURE 
TO MAINTAIN PROPER ALTITUDE (OR CLEARANCE) FROM THE TERRAIN.
