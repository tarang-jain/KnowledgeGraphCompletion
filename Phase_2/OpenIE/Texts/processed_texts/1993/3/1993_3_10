 THE PILOT OBSERVED THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS NOT PRODUCING EXPECTED 
POWER, AND ASSURED DURING THE TAKEOFF GROUND RUN THAT THE PROPELLER, 
THROTTLE, AND MIXTURE CONTROLS WERE FULL FORWARD.  THE TAKEOFF USED 
ABOUT HALF THE LENGTH OF THE 8202 FOOT RUNWAY.  THE AIRCRAFT LIFTED OFF, 
CLIMBED TO ABOUT 50 FEET AND WOULD NOT CLIMB.  THE AIRCRAFT STRUCK A 
LIGHT POLE AND CRASHED IN A FIELD ABOUT 1.5 MILES FROM THE AIRPORT.  
ALTHOUGH THE PILOT NOTED THAT HE HAD EXPECTED TO TAKEOFF GROUND RUN 
TO BE ABOUT 2000 FEET, HE FAILED TO ABORT THE TAKEOFF. 
 THE PILOT DID NOT PERFORM AN ABORT OF THE TAKEOFF AFTER OBSERVING A 
PARTIAL LOSS OF POWER.  FACTORS INCLUDE IMPROPER USE OF THE MIXTURE 
CONTROL.
