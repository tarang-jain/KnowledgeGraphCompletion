 WHILE RETURNING TO THE AIRPORT FROM AN INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT, THE 
ENGINE 'HAD A SUDDEN POWER DROP OF 1300 TO 1400 RPM,'  ACCORDING TO THE 
CFI.  THE CFI 'WENT THROUGH THE EMERGENCY CHECKLIST' AND 'COULD NOT 
HOLD ALTITUDE.' THE ENGINE LOST ALL POWER WHEN THE LEFT MAGNETO WAS 
SELECTED.  THE CFI PERFORMED A FORCED LANDING ON SHORT, SOFT, HILLY 
TERRAIN, AND THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER. THE FLAPS WERE FOUND IN THE 
RETRACTED POSITION, ALTHOUGH THE FLAP SELECTOR SWITCH WAS FOUND IN 
THE FULLY EXTENDED POSITION.  AN EXAMINATION OF THE AIRPLANE DID NOT 
REVEAL ANY MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS. BOTH MAGNETOS WERE 
FUNCTIONALLY TESTED AND MET MANUFACTURER'S TOLERANCES. THE 
TEMPERATURE AND DEW POINT WERE 38 AND 20 DEG, RESPECTIVELY.  ACCORDING 
TO CARBURETOR ICING PROBABILITY CHARTS, CONDITIONS WERE CONDUCIVE TO 
VISIBLE ICING AT GLIDE AND CRUISE POWER; THE CARBURETOR HEAT WAS FOUND 
IN A MIDWAY POSITION. 
 LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DUE TO UNDETERMINED REASONS.  A FACTOR RELATED 
TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE SHORT, SOFT, HILLY TERRAIN CONDITION IN THE 
EMERGENCY LANDING AREA.
