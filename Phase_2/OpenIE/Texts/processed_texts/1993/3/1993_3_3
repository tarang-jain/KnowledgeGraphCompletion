THE INSTRUMENT RATED PILOT DEPARTED DURING MARGINAL VFR CONDITIONS.  
ABOUT  48 MINUTES LATER, THE PILOT CONTACTED THE AIR ROUTE TRAFFIC 
CONTROL CENTER  AND ADVISED HIM THAT HE WAS UNSURE OF HIS POSITION AND 
REQUESTED ASSISTANCE. THE SECTOR CONTROLLER COULD NOT RADAR IDENTIFY 
THE AIRPLANE AND INSTRUCTED  THE PILOT TO CONTACT ANOTHER SECTOR 
CONTROLLER.  THE PILOT BECAME CONFUSED  AND ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT 
VARIOUS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS WITHOUT SUCCESS.   AN AIRCRAFT IN THE 
VICINITY OF THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE MADE INITIAL VISUAL  CONTACT, BUT THE 
ACCIDENT AIRPLANE ENTERED INTO THE CLOUDS AND COULD NOT BE RELOCATED.  
THE AIRLANE'S LEFT WING STRUCK SOME TREES IN A MOUNTAINOUS AREA WHILE 
IN A STEEP DESCENDING ATTITUDE.  THE WRECKAGE EXAMINATION DISCLOSED NO 
EVIDENCE OF ANY PREEXISTING MALFUNCTIONS OR FAILURES. 
THE PILOT'S POOR WEATHER EVALUATION AND CONTINUED FLIGHT INTO 
INSTRUMENT METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. THE LOW CEILING WAS A FACTOR.
