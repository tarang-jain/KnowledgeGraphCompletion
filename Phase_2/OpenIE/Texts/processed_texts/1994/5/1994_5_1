THE PILOT SWITCHED FROM HIS AUXILIARY FUEL TANK TO HIS LEFT MAIN FUEL 
TANK WHEN THE ENGINE STOPPED PRODUCING POWER. HE HAD TO DITCH IN THE 
BAY. THE PILOT SAID HE THOUGHT THE ENGINE FAILED DUE TO FUEL 
MISMANAGEMENT. 
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S DELAY IN SELECTING THE MAIN FUEL TANK POSITION. 
THE LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN FOR A FORCED LANDING WAS A FACTOR.
