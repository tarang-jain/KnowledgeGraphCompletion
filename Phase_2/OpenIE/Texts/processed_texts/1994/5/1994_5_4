THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND HAD FLOWN APPROXIMATELY 2.3 HOURS AFTER HIS 
INITIAL DEPARTURE WITH 45 GALLONS OF FUEL IN THE AMPHIBIOUS FLOAT 
EQUIPPED AIRPLANE.  HIS ESTIMATION OF FUEL CONSUMPTION WAS 39 GALLONS 
PER HOUR (GPH) AT TAKEOFF POWER AND 23 GPH AT CRUISE. SEVERAL TOUCH AND 
GO LANDINGS WERE PERFORMED DURING THE FLIGHT.  WHILE IN CRUISE FLIGHT A 
TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER OCCURRED AND A FORCED LANDING WAS MADE ON 
A GRAVEL ROAD.  DURING LANDING, THE FLOAT NOSE WHEELS DUG INTO SOFT 
GRAVEL AND THE AIRPLANE FLIPPED OVER.  POST CRASH INVESTIGATION 
REVEALED NO ENGINE ANOMOLIES, NO EVIDENCE OF FUEL IN THE TANKS, NOR ANY 
INDICATION OF FUEL SPILLAGE ON THE GROUND.  THE PILOT STATED HE BELIEVED 
HE EXHAUSTED HIS FUEL SUPPLY. 
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S FAILURE TO PERFORM ACCURATE FUEL CONSUMPTION 
CALCULATIONS.  A FACTOR WAS THE SOFT GRAVEL ROAD LANDING AREA.
