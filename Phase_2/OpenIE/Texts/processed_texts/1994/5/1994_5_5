SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF, THE PILOT REQUESTED CLEARANCE TO RETURN FOR AN 
IMMEDIATE LANDING.  A WITNESS SAID THAT HE HEARD A METALLIC NOISE FROM 
THE PLANE AS IT PASSED OVERHEAD.  HE SAID THE PILOT MADE A STEEP RIGHT 
BANK TO LAND ON RUNWAY 29L; HOWEVER, THE PLANE IMPACTED BETWEEN THE 
PARALLEL RUNWAYS. AN EXAM OF THE ENGINE REVEALED 2 FINGER-TIGHT 
CYLINDER BASE NUTS AND UNDERTORQUED BASE NUTS AND CRANKCASE THROUGH-
NUTS. A TEARDOWN REVEALED THE CRANKSHAFT HAD FAILED FROM FATIGUE 
BETWEEN THE #3 AND #4 CONNECTING ROD JOURNALS. A METALLURGICAL EXAM OF 
THE CRANKSHAFT REVEALED HIGH LOCALIZED STRESS-INDUCED FATIGUE CRACKS. 
THE ENGINE HAD ACCUMULATED 266 HRS OF FLIGHT TIME SINCE MAJOR 
OVERHAUL ON 1/11/91. THE PLANE HAD BEEN MODIFIED WITH 2 STC'S, 1 FOR 
INSTALLATION OF A RAYJAY TURBOCHARGER, ANOTHER FOR INSTALLATION OF A 
'BLACKMAC' PROPELLER. THE HOLDER OF THE PROPELLER STC REPORTED THE 
COMPANY WOULD NOT HAVE INSTALLED THE PROPELLER ON A TURBOCHARGED 
ENGINE, SINCE CERTIFICATION VIBRATORY TESTS WERE ONLY MADE ON NORMALLY 
ASPIRATED ENGINES. AFTER INSTALLATION ON 1/17/91, THE PROPELLER WAS 
REMOVED ON 3/19/91 FOR STATIC BALANCE AND 'RE-INDEX PROP #1 BLADE 180 
DEGREES;' ON 3/28/91, IT WAS REMOVED FOR A BLADE ANGLE CHECK; AND ON 
5/23/91, IT RECEIVED A DYNAMIC BALANCE. 
FATIGUE FAILURE OF THE ENGINE CRANKSHAFT; AND FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO 
MAINTAIN ADEQUATE AIRSPEED, WHILE MANEUVERING TO LAND, WHICH 
RESULTED IN A STALL AND COLLISION WITH THE TERRAIN.  FACTORS RELATED TO 
THE ACCIDENT WERE: THE UNDESIRABLE ENGINE/PROPELLER VIBRATION, AND 
THE LOOSE CRANKCASE AND CYLINDER BASE NUTS.
