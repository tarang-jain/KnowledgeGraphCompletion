DURING THE INITIAL CLIMB AFTER TAKEOFF, THE ENGINE QUIT. A FORCED 
LANDING WAS ATTEMPTED, WHICH RESULTED IN A COLLISION WITH A DITCH AS 
THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO RE-LAND ON THE REMAINDER OF THE DEPARTURE 
RUNWAY. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE MOVED THE FUEL SELECTOR FROM THE 
AUXILIARY TANK POSITION TO THE OFF POSITION  INSTEAD OF THE MAIN TANK 
POSITION. 
The pilot's improper positioning of the fuel selector, which resulted in fuel starvation during 
the initial climb after takeoff. A factor was a ditch adjacent to the runway.
