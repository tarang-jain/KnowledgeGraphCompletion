Witnesses stated that the student pilot, who had no confirmed flight experience, assembled the 
aircraft on the day of the accident at the airport from a kit of preassembled major components. 
The pilot told the witnesses that he was going to perform some taxi tests and proceeded to do 
several taxi runs along the runway. The aircraft was then observed to line up on the runway, 
add what was described as full power, then takeoff. The witnesses said the aircraft leveled off 
about 30 feet above the runway and flew down the complete length of the pavement. Past the 
departure end of the runway, the aircraft abruptly pitched nose down and impacted the ground 
about 1,000 feet from the runway end. An FAA inspector reported that control system 
continuity was established throughout the aircraft during his examination. The witnesses 
reported that the engine sounds were consistent and strong up to the point of ground impact. A 
review of FAA system records revealed no evidence of a registration or airworthiness certificate 
application by the pilot. 
the pilot's failure to maintain control of the aircraft.  A factor in the accident was his complete 
lack of any flight experience or instruction.
