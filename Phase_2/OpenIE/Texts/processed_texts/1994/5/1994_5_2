THE FLIGHTCREW REPORTED THAT WHILE EXTENDING THE LANDING GEAR, THE 
NOSE GEAR DID NOT INDICATE DOWN AND LOCKED. AFTER FURTHER ATTEMPTS TO 
LOWER THE NOSE GEAR WERE UNSUCCESSFUL, THE AIRCRAFT WAS LANDED WITH 
THE NOSE GEAR NOT DOWN AND LOCKED. INSPECTION REVEALED THAT THE 
NOSEWHEEL STEERING SYSTEM WAS INCORRECTLY RIGGED; THE NOSE GEAR 
WOULD NOT PROPERLY CENTER ITSELF, AND THE NOSEWHEEL STEERING CABLE 
TENSIONS WERE BELOW REQUIRED LIMITS. THIS RESULTED IN A SITUATION 
WHERE THE NOSE GEAR WOULD IMPINGE ON THE SIDE WALL OF THE GEAR WELL, 
PREVENTING EXTENSION. THE AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURER REPORTED THAT IT 
REQUIRED A COMBINATION OF NOSE GEAR MISRIGGING, WITH REDUCED CABLE 
TENSIONS, TO DUPLICATE THIS SCENARIO. ABOUT TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO THE 
INCIDENT, THE NOSEWHEEL STEERING CONTROL VALVE WAS REPLACED, WHICH 
WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A CHECK OF THE NOSE GEAR RIGGING. 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
THE IMPROPER RIGGING OF THE NOSE WHEEL STEERING SYSTEM BY COMPANY 
MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL.
