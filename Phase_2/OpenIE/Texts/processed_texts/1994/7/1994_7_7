THE PILOT STATED THAT AS HE WAS MAKING HIS TURN AT THE END OF HIS SECOND 
AERIAL APPLICATION PASS, THE ENGINE LOST POWER WITHOUT WARNING, WHILE 
THE AIRPLANE WAS AT ABOUT 200 FEET AGL. HE SUBSEQUENTLY ATTEMPTED A 
FORCED LANDING BETWEEN TWO TREE LINES; HOWEVER, THE AIRPLANE STALLED 
PRIOR TO TOUCHDOWN AND ONE WING DUG INTO THE GROUND AND THE 
AIRPLANE CART WHEELED.  THE REASON FOR THE POWER LOSS WAS NOT 
DETERMINED. 
THE POWER LOSS FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS. FACTORS WERE THE PILOT'S 
INADVERTENT ENTRY INTO A STALL AND THE LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN ONTO 
WHICH TO EXECUTE THE LANDING.
