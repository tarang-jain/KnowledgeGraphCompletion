THE PILOT REPORTED HE WAS FLYING AN AERIAL APPLICATION SWATH RUN ALONG 
THE SIDE OF A HILL.  HE SAID HE FLEW THROUGH A WHIRLWIND AND THE BOOM 
STRUCK THE WHEAT. THE AIRPLANE SWUNG AROUND AND STOPPED IN 
APPROXIMATELY 300 FEET 
the pilot's failure to maintain clearance from the wheat field.  A factor was the turbulence.
