APPROACHING THE AIRPORT, THE FLIGHTCREW OF THE B-737, N769AS, MADE 
INITIAL CONTACT WITH THE LOCAL CONTROLLER, AND WAS ADVISED OF A LEFT 
DOWNWIND FOR RUNWAY 26. AT ABOUT 5 MI SW OF THE ARPT, THE FLIGHTCREW 
WAS ADVISED OF PATTERN TRAFFIC THAT INCLUDED THE DEPARTING C-185, 
N1470Q, STARTING A LEFT DOWNWIND. THE PILOT OF THE C-185 WAS ALSO ADVISED 
OF THE B-737 ENTERING DOWNWIND, TO WHICH THE PILOT REPLIED '...ROGER 
HAVE TRAFFIC IN SIGHT WILL STAY LOW.' THE PILOT WAS NOT INSTRUCTED TO 
ADJUST HIS FLIGHTPATH TO REMAIN CLEAR OF THE B-737. THE FLIGHTCREW OF 
THE B-737 SUBSEQUENTLY REPORTED A 'NEAR MISS' TO THE TOWER. THE B-737 
FLIGHTCREW AND THE C-185 PILOT ESTIMATED THEIR SEPARATION AS LESS THAN 
50 FEET, AT APPROXIMATELY 800 FEET AGL. THE PILOT OF THE B-737 TOOK 'MAX NOSE UP...' EVASIVE 
ACTION. 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
THE FAILURE OF THE LOCAL CONTROLLER TO EXERCISE HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO 
HAVE EACH AIRCRAFT ADJUST ITS FLIGHTPATH TO REMAIN CLEAR OF THE OTHER, 
AND THE FAILURE OF THE PILOT OF THE CESSNA 185 TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE 
VISUAL SEPARATION FROM THE BOEING 737.
