THE PILOT OF THE EXPERIMENTAL HOMEBUILT AIRPLANE WAS OBSERVED 
MANEUVERING ALONG THE SHORELINE AT ABOUT 20 FEET ABOVE THE WATER. THE 
SURVIVING PASSENGER STATED THE PILOT WAS LOWERING THE FLAPS TO SLOW 
THE AIRPLANE TO POINT OUT AN APARTMENT. AS THE PILOT QUICKLY LOWERED 
THE FLAPS THE AIRPLANE PITCHED DOWN, HIT THE WATER, AND SANK. 
THE PILOT'S ABRUPT LOWERING OF THE FLAPS WHICH RESULTED IN A LOSS OF 
CONTROL AT AN ALTITUDE INSUFFICIENT FOR RECOVERY, AND THE PILOT'S 
UNWARRANTED LOW FLYING.
