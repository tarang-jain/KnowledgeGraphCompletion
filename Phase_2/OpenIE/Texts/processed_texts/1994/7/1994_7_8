SHORTLY AFTER LIFTING OFF, THE PILOT LIGHT ON THE BALLOON'S PROPANE 
BURNER EXTINGUISHED FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS, AND ATTEMPTS TO 
RELIGHT IT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. BECAUSE THE BALLOON WAS DESCENDING NEAR 
POWERLINES, THE PILOT 'VENTED' IN ORDER TO RAPIDLY LOSE ALTITUDE. THE 
BALLOON TOUCHED DOWN ON A HIGHWAY, BOUNCED BACK UP, AND THE 
ENVELOPE CONTACTED POWERLINES, BURNING SEVERAL ENVELOPE PANELS. 
A TOTAL FAILURE OF THE BALLOON'S HEATER SYSTEM (PILOT LIGHT) FOR 
UNDETERMINED REASONS. A FACTOR WAS UNSUITABLE TERRAIN ON WHICH TO 
MAKE A FORCED LANDING.
