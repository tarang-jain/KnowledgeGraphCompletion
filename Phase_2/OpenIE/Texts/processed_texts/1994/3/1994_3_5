THE STUDENT PILOT WAS RECEIVING INSTRUCTION IN THE BELL 47 HELICOPTER 
FROM A CERTIFIED FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR (CFI).  AFTER A  1.5 HOUR DUAL 
INSTRUCTION FLIGHT, THE STUDENT AND THE CFI  RETURNED TO THE DEPARTURE 
AIRPORT TO REFUEL, AND WERE PLANNING TO DEPART AGAIN FOR ANOTHER 
TRAINING FLIGHT.  AFTER LANDING, THE HELICOPTER WAS LEFT IDLING WITH THE 
RSP AT THE CONTROLS WHILE THE CFI EXITED THE HELICOPTER TO RETRIEVE THE 
FUEL TRUCK.  THE CFI RETURNED WITH THE FUEL TRUCK, RE-FUELED THE 
HELICOPTER AND WAS RETURNING THE FUEL HOSE TO THE TRUCK WHEN THE 
TURNING ROTOR BLADES STRUCK THE HOSE AND FUEL TRUCK.  THE HOSE IN TURN 
STRUCK THE CFI.  THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE TRUCK HAD BEEN 
PARKED ABOUT 3.5 FEET FROM THE TURNING ROTOR BLADES, AND COMPANY 
POLICY MANDATED A MINIMUM OF A 10 FOOT CLEARANCE.  RE-ENACTMENT OF THE 
HOSE STOWAGE TO THE SIDE OF THE FUEL TRUCK SHOWED A TENDENCY FOR THE 
HOSE TO DEFLECT UP INTO THE ROTOR TIP PATH PLANE. 
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate clearance of the fuel truck from the aircraft, which 
resulted in the main rotor striking the fuel hose and truck during refueling operation.  A factor 
was the pilot's failure to follow company policy pertaining to the refueling of aircraft.
