THE PILOT RECEIVED A FULL WEATHER BRIEFING BEFORE THE IFR FLIGHT. 
CONVECTIVE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WAS FORECAST FOR THE ROUTE OF 
FLIGHT, THERE WERE NUMEROUS THUNDERSTORMS IN THE AREA AT THE TIME OF 
DEPARTURE, AND A TORNADO WAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLH WAS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE 
ACCIDENT. AFTER LEVELING AT FL210, HE REPORTED THAT CONDITIONS WERE 
'GETTING ROUGH.'  SHORTLY THEREAFTER, HE REPORTED PROBLEMS WITH THE 
AIRCRAFT GYRO SYSTEM, THEN SAID ALL GYRO'S WERE 'OUT.'  HE ELECTED TO 
DESCEND IN AN ATTEMPT TO LOCATE VFR WEATHER. AS THE AIRCRAFT 
DESCENDED, RADIO AND RADAR CONTACT WERE LOST. WRECKAGE WAS FOUND 
DISTRIBUTED OVER AN AREA ABOUT 4-1/2 MILES IN LENGTH. AN EXAM OF THE 
WRECKAGE REVEALED EVIDENCE THAT THE WINGS HAD FAILED IN AN UPWARD 
DIRECTION. DURING AN EXAM OF THE VACUUM POWERED ATTITUDE GYRO, NO 
ROTATIONAL SCRAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLHING WAS FOUND ON THE GYRO OR IN THE GYRO HOUSING. 
AN EXAM OF THE LEFT VACUUM PUMP REVEALED THAT THE PLASTIC DRIVE 
COUPLING HAD SIGNS OF HEAT STRESS AND MELTING, THAT THE INTERNAL VEINS 
WERE BROKEN AND CRACKED AND THAT THERE WAS A DEPOSIT OF CARBON MATERIAL 
INSIDE THE HOUSING. THE RIGHT VACUUM PUMP HAD EVIDENCE OF ROTATIONAL 
SCRAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLHING. THE GYROS SHOULD HAVE OPERATED WITH 1 VACUUM PUMP IN 
OPERATION. 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT DUE TO SPATIAL 
DISORIENTATION, AND EXCEEDING THE DESIGN STRESS LIMITS OF THE AIRCRAFT.  
FACTORS RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: THE PILOT'S FLIGHT INTO KNOWN 
ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS, OVERCONFIDENCE IN HIMSELF AND THE 
AIRPLANE, FAILURE OF THE LEFT VACUUM PUMP, PARTIAL LOSS OF THE VACUUM 
SYSTEM, AND AN INOPERATIVE ATTITUDE INDICATOR.
