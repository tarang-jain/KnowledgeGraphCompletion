SWITCHED FUEL TANKS SEVERAL TIMES IN AN ATTEMPT TO REGAIN POWER.  HE 
WAS UNABLE TO SUSTAIN ENGINE POWER AND RESORTED TO A FORCED LANDING 
ON A ROAD, WHERE THE WING STRUCK A SIGN.  SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION 
REVEALED ONLY UNUSABLE FUEL REMAINING IN THE TANKS.  THE PILOT STATED 
THAT HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD FIVE HOURS OF FUEL ON BOARD THE AIRPLANE 
FOR THE INTENDED FLIGHT, BUT AFTER 4.4 HOURS ON THE HOBBS METER THE 
ENGINE BEGAN TO LOSE POWER FROM FUEL EXHAUSTION. 
was the pilot-in-command's failure to refuel the airplane during the flight.  Factors were fuel 
exhaustion, the sign, and the pilot-in-command's lack of total experience in type of airplane.
