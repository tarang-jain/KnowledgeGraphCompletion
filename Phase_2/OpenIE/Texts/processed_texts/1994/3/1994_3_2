THE PILOT CANCELED IFR AND FLEW TO HIS PRIVATE STRIP, WHERE HE ENTERED A 
RIGHT TRAFFIC PATTERN FOR LANDING ON RUNWAY 36 IN DARK NIGHT 
CONDITIONS.  THE STRIP WAS LOCATED IN A RURAL AREA WITH FEW GROUND 
LIGHTS, EXCEPT FOR THE FIRST 1500 FEET OF THE STRIP, WHICH HAD MEDIUM 
INTENSITY RUNWAY LIGHTING (MIRL).  SOUTH OF THE STRIP WAS A LARGE 
MILITARY MANEUVERING AREA THAT HAD NO LIGHTING. AS THE PILOT WAS 
MANEUVERING TO LAND, WITNESSES OBSERVED THE AIRPLANE ENTER A STEEP 
DESCENT. SUBSEQUENTLY, IT CRASHED IN A STEEP NOSE DOWN, RIGHT WING LOW 
ATTITUDE. AN EXAM OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED EVIDENCE THAT THE SPOILERS 
WERE EXTENDED.  TOXICOLOGY TESTS OF THE PILOT'S LIVER AND KIDNEY TISSUE 
SHOWED 0.74 UG/ML AND 0.159 UG/ML, RESPECTIVELY, OF BROMPHENIRAMINE (AN 
ANTIHISTAMINE).  AN FAA TOXICOLOGIST STATED THESE WERE WITHIN A 
THERAPEUTIC RANGE. ACCORDING TO THE PILOT'S SON, HE TOOK DRIXORAL FOR 
SINUS PROBLEMS AND A SLIGHT HEAD COLD; THE MEDICATION WAS NOT APPROVED 
FOR FLYING. 
FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT, WHILE 
MANEUVERING TO LAND.  FACTORS RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: DARKNESS 
AND POSSIBLE SPATIAL DISORIENTATION.
