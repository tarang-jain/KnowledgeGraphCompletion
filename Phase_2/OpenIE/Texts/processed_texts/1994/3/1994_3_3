  DURING INITIAL CLIMB FOLLOWING TAKEOFF, THE AIRCRAFT STALLED AND 
IMPACTED TERRAIN OFF THE END OF THE RUNWAY. EXAMINATION BY THE LOCAL 
POLICE, WITHIN 20 MINUTES FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT, PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF 
ICE ON ALL AIRCRAFT SURFACES.  THE PILOT ALSO STATED THAT HE HAD FAILED TO 
PROPERLY REMOVE ICE FROM THE AIRCRAFT. 
AN INADVERTENT STALL DUE TO IMPROPER PREFLIGHT AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE 
TO ADEQUATELY REMOVE ICE FROM THE AIRCRAFT. A FACTOR WAS AIRFRAME 
ICING.
