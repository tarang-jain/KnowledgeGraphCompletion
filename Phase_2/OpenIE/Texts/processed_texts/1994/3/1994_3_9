THE AIRPLANE RAN OFF THE END OF THE RUNWAY DURING A REJECTED TAKEOFF, 
COMING TO REST ON A DIKE AND A TIDAL MUD FLAT. FDR DATA CONFIRMED THAT 
THE PITOT HEAT HAD NOT BEEN SELECTED 'ON' BY THE FLIGHTCREW. A BUILDUP 
OF SNOW AND/OR ICE IN THE PITOT/STATIC SYSTEM TUBES AND PORTS RESULTED 
IN ERRONEOUS AIRSPEED READINGS DURING THE ATTEMPTED TAKEOFF. 
SUBSTANTIAL DEVIATIONS FROM CHECKLIST PROCEDURES WERE RECORDED ON 
THE CVR. 19 SECONDS ELAPSED BETWEEN THE TIME THAT THE AIRPLANE ACTUALLY 
ACCELERATED THROUGH 60 KIAS (THE FIRST MARK ON THE AIRSPEED INDICATOR) 
AND THE START OF THE REJECTED TAKEOFF. 
THE FAILURE OF THE FLIGHTCREW TO COMPLY WITH CHECKLIST PROCEDURES TO 
TURN ON AN OPERABLE PITOT/STATIC HEAT SYSTEM, RESULTING IN ICE AND/OR 
SNOW BLOCKAGE OF THE PITOT TUBES THAT PRODUCED ERRONEOUS AIRSPEED 
INDICATIONS, AND THE FLIGHTCREW'S UNTIMELY RESPONSE TO ANOMALOUS 
AIRSPEED INDICATIONS WITH THE CONSEQUENT REJECTION OF TAKEOFF AT AN 
ACTUAL SPEED OF 5 KNOTS ABOVE V1. (NTSB REPORT AAR-95/01)
