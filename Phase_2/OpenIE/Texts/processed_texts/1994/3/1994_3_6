DURING AN ATTEMPTED LANDING IN A CROSSWIND, THE PRIVATE PILOT, WHO WAS 
FLYING FROM THE RIGHT SEAT, ALLOWED THE AIRCRAFT TO DRIFT OFF THE SIDE 
OF THE RUNWAY DURING THE FLARE. HIS ATTEMPTED REMEDIAL ACTION WAS NOT 
ADEQUATE TO CORRECT THE SITUATION, AND THE AIRCRAFT IMPACTED A RUNWAY 
DESIGNATOR SIGN AND A RUNWAY LIGHT. 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PROPER ALIGNMENT WITH THE RUNWAY. THE 
CROSSWIND WAS OF FACTOR.
