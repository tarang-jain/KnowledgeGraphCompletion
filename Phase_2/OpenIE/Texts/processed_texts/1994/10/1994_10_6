THE PILOT TOOK OFF AND REMAINED IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN. WITNESSES SAID 
HE HAD DIFFICULTY LOWERING THE LANDING GEAR AND BY THE TIME IT WAS 
FULLY EXTENDED, THE AIRPLANE HAD TURNED FINAL AND WAS HALFWAY DOWN 
THE RUNWAY. WITNESSES SAID POWER WAS INCREASED, THE NOSE PITCHED UP, 
THE LEFT WING DROPPED, AND THE AIRPLANE DOVE OR SPUN TO THE GROUND. 
THE PILOT'S BROTHER SAID THAT ON A PREVIOUS TEST FLIGHT, THE PILOT HAD 
MADE A FORCED LANDING WHEN THE PROPELLER FEATHERED, AND IT APPEARED 
TO HIM THE SAME THING HAPPENED ON THIS FLIGHT. THE PROPELLER 
DISASSEMBLY REPORT INDICATED THE BLADE ANGLE WAS '40 DEGREES TO 45 
DEGREES. . . CONSIDERED HIGH FOR A SLOW SPEED IMPACT.' THIS WOULD BE 
POSSIBLE IF 'THE CONFIGURATION'S OUTPUT CONTROL PRESSURE WAS NOT 
CAPABLE OF MAINTAINING BLADE ANGLE, AND THAT THE PROPELLER WAS 
SLIPPING TO COARSE PITCH.' NO OIL LEAKS NOR PROPELLER GOVERNOR 
ANOMALIES WERE FOUND. 
AN INADVERTENT PILOT-INDUCED STALL AT TOO LOW AN ALTITUDE TO EFFECT A 
SAFE RECOVERY. FACTORS WERE THE MALFUNCTIONING PROPELLER SYSTEM AND 
THE UNCOMMANDED FEATHERING OF THE PROPELLER.
