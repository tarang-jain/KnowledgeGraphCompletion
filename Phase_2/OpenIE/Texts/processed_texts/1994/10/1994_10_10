THE PILOT MADE TWO ATTEMPTS TO LAND ON A DARK NIGHT TO AN UNLIGHTED 
GRASS STRIP.  ON HIS THIRD ATTEMPT HE ALLOWED THE AIRCRAFT TO SINK TOO 
LOW AND SLOW. A PASSENGER WARNED THE PILOT TO 'GET IT UP' AND THE PILOT 
APPLIED FULL POWER; HOWEVER, IT STRUCK A FENCE.  FOLLOWING THE FENCE 
STRIKE THE PILOT PULLED OFF POWER AND THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH THE 
TERRAIN, COMING TO REST 30 YARDS FROM THE FENCE. 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN A PROPER GLIDEPATH RESULTING IN A 
COLLISION WITH AN OBJECT. FACTORS WERE THE DARK NIGHT AND THE PILOT'S 
DISREGARD FOR THE LACK OF LIGHTS.
