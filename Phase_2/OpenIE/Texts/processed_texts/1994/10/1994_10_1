THE FLIGHT WAS DEPARTING AN AIRSTRIP THAT WAS IN POOR CONDITION.  THE 
PILOT STATED THE LEFT MAIN GEAR 'SLIPPED' INTO A DEPRESSION IN THE 
RUNWAY'S SURFACE DURING THE TAKEOFF ROLL.  THE AIRPLANE CONTINUED TO 
SLIP OFF THE RUNWAY UNTIL THE LEFT WHEEL STRUCK THE WILLOWS GROWING 
ON THE RUNWAY'S EDGE.  THE PILOT STATED IT WAS TOO LATE TO ABORT THE 
TAKEOFF AND THE AIRPLANE OVERRAN THE END OF THE RUNWAY. 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PROPER RUNWAY ALIGNMENT DURING THE 
TAKEOFF ROLL.  A FACTOR ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACCIDENT WAS THE 
ROUGH/UNEVEN CONDITION OF THE RUNWAY'S SURFACE.
