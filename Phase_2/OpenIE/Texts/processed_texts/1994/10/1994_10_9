AS THE LEVEL 6 THUNDERSTORM PASSED OVER THE AIRPORT FROM NORTHWEST 
TO SOUTHEAST, THE CAPTAIN ELECTED NOT TO TAKE OFF BECAUSE OF THE 
FALLING HAIL. AFTER WAITING ABOUT 30 MINUTES, THE FLIGHT TOOK OFF ON 
RUNWAY 35L. THE CAPTAIN REQUESTED A RIGHT TURN, AND WAS ASSIGNED A 
HEADING OF 080 DEGREES AND CLEARED TO CLIMB TO 20,000 FEET. THE AIRPLANE 
ENTERED THE OVERCAST AND ENCOUNTERED 'LIGHT HAIL.' AS IT TURNED ONTO ITS 
ASSIGNED HEADING, THE AIRBORNE WEATHER RADAR INDICATED HEAVY 
PRECIPITATION AHEAD. A REQUEST WAS MADE FOR A TURN FURTHER RIGHT. 
SUDDENLY, THE RIGHT WINDSHIELD SHATTERED, SENDING GLASS PARTICLES INTO 
THE FIRST OFFICER'S EYES. THE AIRPLANE IMMEDIATELY DESCENDED TO VISUAL 
METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, RETURNED TO THE AIRPORT, AND LANDED. 
THE CAPTAIN'S INACCURATE EVALUATION OF WEATHER CONDITIONS, AND HIS 
DECISION TO FLY INTO KNOWN ADVERSE WEATHER. A FACTOR WAS THE HAIL.
