PRIVATE PILOTS, ENROLLED IN A PROFESSIONAL PILOT COURSE, WERE BUILDING 
CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT TIME FOR THEIR COMMERCIAL CERTIFICATION. ON THE 
RETURN FLIGHT FROM CALIFORNIA TO TEXAS, ROUTING WAS PLANNED THROUGH 
COLORADO FOR THE INSTRUCTIONAL PORTION OF THE MOUNTAIN CURRICULUM. 
AIRMETS INCLUDED WEATHER ADVISORIES FOR TURBULENCE. THE FLIGHT 
INSTRUCTOR AMENDED THE FLIGHT ROUTE AND CONTINUED EVEN THOUGH 
FLIGHT WAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLH ISSUED THE AIRMET FOR TURBULENCE AND THAT VFR WAS NOT 
RECOMMENDED. COMPANY PERSONNEL REPORTED THAT THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR 
HAD MADE NUMEROUS FLIGHTS ALONG THE REGULAR MOUNTAIN FLYING 
CURRICULUM ROUTE (HIGHEST ELEVATION 9,927 FEET); HOWEVER, 'THIS WAS THE 
INSTRUCTOR'S FIRST TRIP CROSSING THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE THROUGH THE 
CANYON AT ELWOOD PASS' AN ELEVATION OF 11,875 FEET. DENSITY ALTITUDE WAS 
CALCULATED AT 14,000 FEET. THIS WAS THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR'S SECOND 
DEMONSTRATION THAT DAY FOR A 180 DEGREE TURN- AROUND PROCEDURE IN A 
BOX CANYON ENVIRONMENT. THE INSTRUCTOR STATED THAT 'NEAR THE 
COMPLETION OF THE TURN, WE EXPERIENCED A SEVERE UNEXPECTED 
DOWNDRAFT' WITH A RESULTING RATE OF DECENT OF '6,000 FPM' AND THE 
AIRPLANE HIT THE TREES. 
THE PILOT'S CONTINUED FLIGHT INTO KNOWN ADVERSE WEATHER. FACTORS WERE 
THE PILOT'S LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA, THE 
TURBULENCE AND HIGH DENSITY ALTITUDE.
