THE COMMUTER AIRPLANE WAS PARKED AT THE GATE WITH 50 SEATED  
PASSENGERS, AND A CREW OF THREE.  THE ENGINES WERE STOPPED, THE CHOCKS 
WERE IN PLACE, THE PILOTS WERE SEATED IN THE COCKPIT COMPLETING PAPER 
WORK, AND THE AIRSTAIR DOOR WAS OPEN.  A BAGGAGE TRACTOR (DH4) HAD 
BROKEN DOWN, AND THE OPERATOR ASKED ANOTHER BAGGAGE TRACTOR 
OPERATOR (DH65), TO PUSH HIM TO THE END OF THE RAMP TO AWAIT SERVICE.  
DH65 BEGAN PUSHING DH4, WHICH STEERED TO PASS 15 TO 20 FEET TO THE LEFT 
OF THE AIRPLANE.  AS DH4 ENTERED THE SERVICE ROAD, IT BEGAN TO TURN RIGHT 
TO HEAD WEST.  AT THIS POINT, DH65 HAD NOT YET ENTERED THE SERVICE ROAD 
AND CONTINUED SOUTHWESTERLY FOR AN ADDITIONAL FEW FEET.  AT THIS TIME, 
THE LEFT SIDE OF DH65'S FRONT HITCH, CONTACTED THE RIGHT SIDE OF DH4'S 
REAR HITCH.  THE HITCH CONTACT JERKED THE FRONT OF DH65 TO THE RIGHT 
WHICH CAUSED THE DRIVER TO BE PITCHED HALFWAY OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF DH65.  
AS THE DRIVER FELL, HIS HAND PULLED DOWN ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND HIS 
FOOT PRESSED DOWN ON THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL.  DH65 THEN VEERED INTO THE 
NOSE OF THE AIRPLANE. 
THE VEHICLE OPERATOR'S IMPROPER HANDLING OF THE BAGGAGE TRACTOR 
RESULTING IN LOSS OF CONTROL OF A SECOND BAGGAGE TRACTOR BEING PUSHED 
AND ITS SUBSEQUENT COLLISION WITH THE AIRPLANE.
