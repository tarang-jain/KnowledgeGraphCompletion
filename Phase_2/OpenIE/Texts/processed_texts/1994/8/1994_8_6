AERIAL APPLICATION WORK WAS COMPLETED AT ONE LOCATION. THE AIRPLANE 
WAS IN CRUISE FLIGHT AT 700 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND TO ANOTHER LOCATION, 
WHEN A TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER OCCURRED. AN EMERGENCY DESCENT AND 
APPROACH WAS MADE TO A COTTON TURN ROW. DURING THE LANDING ROLL ON 
THE ROUGH TURN ROW, THE AIRPLANE GROUND LOOPED. EXAMINATION OF THE 
ENGINE REVEALED THE FAILURE OF A BEARING IN THE BLOWER SECTION CAUSED 
THE ENGINE TO SEIZE. 
TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER AS THE ENGINE SEIZED DUE TO A BLOWER BEARING 
FAILURE. A FACTOR WAS THE LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN FOR THE FORCED 
LANDING.
