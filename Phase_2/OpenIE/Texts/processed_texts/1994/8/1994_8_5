THE HELICOPTER EXPERIENCED A COMPLETE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DURING AN 
IGNITION FIRE CONTROL FLIGHT AT 100 FEET AGL. THE PILOT ENTERED 
AUTOROTATION TO THE ONLY AVAILABLE FORCED LANDING AREA. THE AIRCRAFT 
TOUCHED DOWN HARD AND SUSTAINED STRUCTURAL DAMAGE. POSTACCIDENT 
EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REALED THAT BOTH CONNECTING ROD BOLTS IN 
THE #1 CYLINDER WERE FRACTURED. A SAFETY BOARD METALLURGICAL 
EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT ONE OF THE CONNECTING ROD BOLTS HAD FAILED 
DUE TO A PREEXISTING FATIGUE CRACK THAT EMANATED FROM THE HEAD-TO-
SHOULDER FILLET RADIUS OF THE BOLT. THE ENGINE WAS LAST OVERHAULED IN 
1970. THE ENGINE MANUFACTURER ADVISES IN THEIR SERVICE INSTRUCTION 
LETTER DATED 7/1/92 THAT 'ALL ENGINES THAT DO NOT ACCUMULATE THE 
RECOMMENDED TIME OPERATING HOURS BETWEEN OVERHAULS IN A TWELVE 
YEAR PERIOD, MUST BE OVERHAULED DURING THE TWELFTH YEAR.' TEXTRON 
LYCOMING MANDATORY SERVICE BULLETIN NO. 240M REQUIRES REPLACEMENT OF 
THE CONNECTING ROD BOLTS AND NUTS EACH TIME THE ENGINE IS SUBJECT TO 
OVERHAUL. 
INADEQUATE MAINTENANCE AND A FATIGUE FAILURE OF A #1 CYLINDER 
CONNECTING ROD BOLT. A FACTOR WAS THE LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN 
AVAILABLE TO THE PILOT FOR A FORCED LANDING.
