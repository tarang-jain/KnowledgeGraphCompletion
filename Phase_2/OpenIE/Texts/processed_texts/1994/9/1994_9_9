AFTER A LOCAL FLIGHT, THE PILOT WAS ON FINAL TO THE PRIVATE GRASS STRIP 
WHERE THE FLIGHT ORIGINATED.  HE HELD LEFT CONTROL CORRECTION ON FINAL 
FOR A LEFT QUARTERING HEAD WIND.  ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, AT GROUND 
LEVEL THE WIND 'QUIT.' THE AIRPLANE TOUCHED DOWN WITH THE LEFT MAIN 
GEAR OFF OF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY.  THE PILOT WAS NOT ABLE TO 
DIRECT THE AIRPLANE TO THE CENTER OF THE RUNWAY.  THE AIRPLANE TRAVELED 
ABOUT 90 FEET, THE LEFT GEAR WENT INTO A DITCH, AND THE LEFT WING STRUCK 
A WOODEN POST.  THE AIRPLANE THEN DID A LEFT GROUND LOOP.  WINDS 
REPORTED 11 MILES FROM THE ACCIDENT SITE WERE AT 060 DEGREES AT 8 KNOTS. 
The pilot's (1) inadequate compensation for wind conditions and (2) failure to align with the 
runway during landing touch down.
