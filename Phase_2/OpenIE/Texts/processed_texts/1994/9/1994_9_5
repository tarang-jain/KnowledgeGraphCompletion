DURING RECURRENT TRAINING, NIGHT AUTOROTATIONS WERE BEING CONDUCTED. 
THE COMMERCIAL PILOT UNDER INSTRUCTION WAS HAVING DIFFICULTIES 
KEEPING THE HELICOPTER ALIGNED WITH THE RUNWAY PRIOR TO TOUCH DOWN.  
HE HAD COMPLETED 3 AUTOROTATIONS WITH A 180 DEGREE TURN. ON THE 
FOURTH AUTOROTATION, THE HELICOPTER WAS NOT ALIGNED. WHILE THE 
INSTRUCTOR PILOT ATTEMPTED TO CORRECT THE HELICOPTER'S ALIGNMENT, IT 
TOUCHED DOWN HARD WITH THE NOSE LEFT OF CENTERLINE. THE TAILBOOM 
FLEXED, RESULTING IN WRINKLES TO THE TAILBOOM SKIN. 
THE CERTIFICATED FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR'S INADEQUATE SUPERVISION. A FACTOR 
WAS THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PROPER LANDING ALIGNMENT.
