According to the pilot, as he approached his destination airport in his hot air balloon, the 
balloon encountered a downdraft from a dissipating thunderstorm.  He intended to bring the 
hot air balloon down to the ground quickly to avoid the wind from blowing the balloon across 
the ground. Although he continued burning all the way to the ground, the pilot was unable to 
stop the balloon's high rate of descent.  The gondola impacted the ground hard, rebounded into 
the air to approximately 100 feet above the ground, and then impacted the ground again.  The 
balloon continued along the ground until it struck power lines where it came to rest. 
the pilot's excessive rate of descent to landing.  Factors in the accident were the gusts and 
downdraft.
