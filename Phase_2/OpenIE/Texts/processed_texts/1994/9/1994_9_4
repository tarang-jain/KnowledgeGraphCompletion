DURING A SERIES OF TOUCH AND GO LANDINGS THE STUDENT PILOT OBSERVED A 
STORM APPROACHING FROM THE SOUTH SO HE ELECTED TO MAKE THE NEXT 
APPROACH TO A FULL STOP. DURING FINAL APPROACH THE STUDENT PILOT HAD 
TROUBLE MAINTAINING CONTROL WHEN THE WIND 'SUDDENLY SHIFTED AND THE 
AIRPLANE REACTED VIOLENTLY TO THE TURBULENCE.' THE PILOT WAS ABLE TO 
LAND BUT THE AIRPLANE DEPARTED THE RUNWAY AND NOSED OVER. AN 
INSTRUCTOR PILOT/WITNESS CONFIRMED THE SUDDEN SHIFT IN THE WIND. THE 
APPROACHING STORM AND CHANGE IN WIND CONDITIONS WERE UNFORCASTED. 
THE UNFAVORABLE GUSTING WINDS. A FACTOR WAS THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO 
MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL.
