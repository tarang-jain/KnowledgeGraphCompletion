THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH TWO MOTOR VEHICLES NEAR THE THRESHOLD OF 
AND DURING THE APPROACH TO RUNWAY 28L.  THE PILOT CANCELED HIS IFR 
FLIGHT PLAN 5 MILES FROM THE AIRPORT.  ACCORDING TO THE PILOT,'...THE 
AIRPORT WAS LOST FROM VIEW ON DOWNWIND.'  HE TURNED BASE, AND 
DESCRIBED THE TURN AS BEING MADE, '...AT A POINT WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO 
BE SOME WHAT PREMATURE IN ORDER TO REGAIN SIGHT OF THE AIRPORT.'  HE 
REGAINED SIGHT OF THE AIRPORT AFTER TURNING BASE, AND WROTE '...BUT THE 
ALTITUDE WAS PERCEIVED TO BE SLIGHTLY LOW FOR THE POSITION OF THE 
AIRCRAFT RELATIVE TO THE AIRPORT.' THE PILOT ADDED POWER, AND THE SINK 
RATE SUBSIDED. ON SHORT FINAL, AS THE AIRPLANE FLEW OVER A NORTH-SOUTH 
ORIENTED ROAD, AT THE APPROACH END OF THE RUNWAY, THE RIGHT WING TIP 
TANK STRUCK THE WINDSHIELD OF A DUMP TRUCK IN THE SOUTHBOUND LANE; 
THE LEFT WING STRUCK THE ROOF OF A VAN IN THE NORTHBOUND LANE. THE 
AIRPLANE LANDED ON A GRASS RUNWAY, THE LANDING GEAR COLLAPSED, AND THE 
AIRPLANE SKIDDED ON THE GROUND, COMING TO REST ON THE SIDE OF THE 
RUNWAY. 
The pilot misjudged altitude and distance which resulted in a undershoot of the runway and 
collision with objects.
