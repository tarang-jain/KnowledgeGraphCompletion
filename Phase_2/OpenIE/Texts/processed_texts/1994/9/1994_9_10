THE PILOT STATED THAT DURING A LANDING: 'AIRCRAFT FLARED...AND ROSE DUE 
TO GROUND EFFECT.'  THE AIRPLANE FLOATED DOWN THE RUNWAY, AND THE 
TOUCHDOWN OCCURRED FAR DOWN THE RUNWAY.  THE AIRPLANE EXITED THE 
END OF THE RUNWAY, AND THE PILOT APPLIED RIGHT BRAKE TO AVOID IMPACTING 
A FENCE.  THE NOSE GEAR COLLAPSED, AND THE AIRPLANE IMPACTED THE ROUGH 
TERRAIN. THE FAA INSPECTOR STATED IN HIS REPORT: '...THE AIRCRAFT TOUCHED 
DOWN AT HIGH SPEED ON THE LAST 268 FEET OF USABLE RUNWAY.  AFTER 
CONTINUING OFF THE RUNWAY AT HIGH SPEED, THE PILOT PLACED THE AIRCRAFT 
INTO A HARD RIGHT TURN.' 
The pilot maintaining excessive airspeed during the landing, resulting in a touchdown on the 
runway with insufficient distance to stop, and a subsequent intentional ground loop and 
collision with the terrain.  Also causal was the pilot's failure to abort the landing.
