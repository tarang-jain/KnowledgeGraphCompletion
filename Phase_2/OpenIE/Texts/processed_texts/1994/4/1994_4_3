DURING THE INITIAL CLIMB THE ENGINE LOST POWER AND THE PILOT EXECUTED A 
FORCED LANDING IN A FIELD OFF THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY.  THE 
AIRCRAFT STRUCK A FENCE. AN EXAMINATION OF THE AIRCRAFT REVEALED THAT 
THE MUFFLER BAFFLE HAD COME LOOSE. 
THE PARTIAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER. A FACTOR WAS THE LACK OF SUITABLE 
TERRAIN.
