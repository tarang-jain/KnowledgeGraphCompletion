THE PILOT WAS IN A HOVER AT 125 FEET AGL AND ZERO HORIZONTAL VELOCITY 
WHEN THE ENGINE QUIT. HE HAD BEEN CONDUCTING LOGGING OPERATIONS FOR 
APPROXIMATELY 40 MINUTES ON A 200 POUND FUEL LOAD. HE EXECUTED AN 
AUTOROTATION BUT LANDED HARD WITH THE HELICOPTER ROLLING OVER. THE 
PILOT REPORTED THAT HE RAN OUT OF FUEL WHILE IN THE HOVER. 
AUTOROTATION FROM 125 FEET AT ZERO AIRSPEED WAS OUTSIDE THE PARAMETERS 
OF THE AIRCRAFT'S 'HEIGHT - VELOCITY' DIAGRAM. 
FUEL EXHAUSTION, THE PILOT IN COMMAND'S FAILURE TO REFUEL THE AIRCRAFT, 
AND THE INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE AN AUTO- ROTATION LANDING 
BECAUSE OF THE LOW ALTITUDE.
