THE PRIVATE PILOT AND FOUR PARACHUTISTS WERE ON BOARD THE AIRPLANE AS 
IT TAXIED FOR TAKEOFF.  THE WIND CONDITIONS WERE REPORTED BETWEEN 14 
AND 16 KNOTS.  THE PILOT STATED THAT HE ADDED FULL POWER, ACHIEVED 
FLYING SPEED, ROTATED, AND BEGAN TO CLIMB OUT.  HE STATED THAT THE 
AIRPLANE THEN ENCOUNTERED WIND SHEAR.  HE LOST CONTROL OF THE 
AIRPLANE AND IT DRIFTED INTO A TREE LOCATED ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE 
RUNWAY.  THE PILOT DID NOT REPORT ANY MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS AND 
STATED THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE INITIATED THE FLIGHT BECAUSE OF THE HIGH 
WINDS. 
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE AIRSPEED DURING 
THE TAKEOFF.  A FACTOR RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT IS THE GUSTY WIND 
CONDITIONS.
