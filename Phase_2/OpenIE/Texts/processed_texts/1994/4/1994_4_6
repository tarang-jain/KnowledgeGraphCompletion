THE PILOT WAS ATTEMPTING A LANDING ON THE SHORT RUNWAY. HE STATED THAT 
HE USED 85 KNOTS INDICATED AIRSPEED ON FINAL APPROACH. THE AIRPLANE 
FLOATED DOWN THE RUNWAY, AND DID NOT TOUCH DOWN UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 
ONE HALF OF THE RUNWAY HAD BEEN USED. THE AIRCRAFT RAN OFF THE END OF 
THE RUNWAY, AND IMPACTED TREES BEFORE COMING TO REST ON A GOLF COURSE 
PAST THE DEPARTURE END OF RUNWAY 31. 
The excessive speed used on final approach to the short runway by the pilot, and the failure of 
the pilot to use the proper touchdown point on the runway for landing.
