AS AN INSTRUCTOR (CFI) AND STUDENT IN A CESSNA 172 WERE MAKING TOUCH-AND-GO'S 
ON RUNWAY 14R, A BM-4 PILOT TRANSMITTED ON UNICOM THAT HE WAS 
APPROACHING FROM THE WEST FOR A BASE ENTRY.  REPORTEDLY, THE CESSNA 
PILOTS WERE TRANSMITTING THEIR POSITIONS ON UNICOM, ALSO.  THE BM-4 
SUBSEQUENTLY TURNED BASE TO FINAL BEHIND THE CESSNA AND WAS SEEN 
CONVERGING ON THE CESSNA IN DISTANCE AND ALTITUDE. IMPACT OCCURRED ON 
SHORT FINAL.  WITNESSES SAID THE AIRPLANES REMAINED TOGETHER, ROTATED 
TO THE LEFT AND DESCENDED VERTICALLY TO THE GROUND.  THE BM-4 COLOR WAS 
WHITE WITH YELLOW TRIM AND THE CESSNA WAS COLORED WHITE WITH BROWN 
TRIM.   YELLOW PAINT TRANSFER WAS OBSERVED ON THE UPPER LEFT WING 
SURFACE, AFT CABIN SUPPORT POST AND AFT WINDSHIELD OF THE CESSNA.  LEADING 
EDGE DAMAGE OF THE RIGHT WING OF THE BM-4 WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO 
THE WIDTH OF THE AFT CABIN WINDOW OF THE CESSNA.  AN IMPACT SIGNATURE 
MEASUREMENT AT THE OUTBOARD PORTION OF THE LEFT FLAP OF THE CESSNA 
WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE BM-4 RIGHT LANDING GEAR STRUT WIDTH.
INADEQUATE VISUAL LOOKOUT BY THE PILOT OF THE HAWK BM-4, WHICH 
RESULTED IN HIS FAILURE TO SEE-AND-AVOID THE CESSNA 172. THE BM-4 PILOT'S 
NON-STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR ENTERING THE TRAFFIC PATTERN WAS A 
RELATED FACTOR.
