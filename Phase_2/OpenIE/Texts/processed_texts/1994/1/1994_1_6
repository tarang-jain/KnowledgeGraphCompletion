ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTOR PILOT, THE STUDENT PILOT MADE THREE GOOD 
LANDINGS. ON THE FOURTH LANDING, AS THE AIRPLANE STARTED ITS LANDING 
ROLL, IT VEERED TO THE RIGHT, DEPARTED THE RUNWAY ONTO ROUGH TERRAIN, 
AND CAME TO REST IN A DITCH. THE INSTRUCTOR APPLIED FULL LEFT RUDDER, BUT 
IT HAD NO EFFECT. 
WAS THE DUAL STUDENT PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL.  A 
FACTOR WAS THE CERTIFICATED FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR'S INADEQUATE 
SUPERVISION.
