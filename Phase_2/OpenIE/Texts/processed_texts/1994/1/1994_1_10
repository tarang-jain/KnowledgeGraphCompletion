AFTER DEPARTING THE AIRPORT, THE PILOT ELECTED TO FLY LOW BETWEEN TWO 
MOUNTAIN RANGES. WHILE FLYING THROUGH THE CANYON THE AIRPLANE STRUCK 
POWERLINES ABOUT 180 FEET AGL. THE PILOT WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF 
THE AIRPLANE, AND RETURNED AND LANDED AT THE DEPARTURE AIRPORT 
WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO SEE AND AVOID THE POWERLINES. A RELATED FACTOR 
WAS THE PILOT'S POOR JUDGMENT IN FLYING AT LOW ALTITUDE.
