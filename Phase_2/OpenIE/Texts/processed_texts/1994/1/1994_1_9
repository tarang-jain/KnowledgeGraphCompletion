THE PILOT WAS ATTEMPTING A TAKEOFF FROM AN 800 FOOT LONG OPEN FIELD 
WHEN HE ENCOUNTERED A GUSTING QUARTERING TAILWIND. THE AIRCRAFT LOST 
AIRSPEED, AND ITS RATE OF CLIMB DECREASED JUST AFTER LIFT OFF. THIS 
RESULTED IN THE AIRCRAFT IMPACTING A TREE THAT WAS JUST OFF THE 
DEPARTURE END OF THE FIELD. 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CLEARANCE. FACTORS INCLUDE A TAILWIND, 
GUSTS, AND A TREE JUST OFF THE DEPARTURE END OF THE FIELD USED FOR 
TAKEOFF.
