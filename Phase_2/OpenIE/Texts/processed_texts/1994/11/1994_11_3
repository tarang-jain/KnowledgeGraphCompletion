The pilot was in cruise flight at about 1,000 feet msl when he experienced smoke entering the 
cockpit from beneath the floor. A precautionary landing was made to a harvested cotton field. 
On landing roll-out the pilot observed a tree line to his front, he applied heavy braking, the 
airplane nosed down on the propeller and rocked back on its landing gear. The airplane was 
destroyed by a post crash fire. Examination of the wreckage by the FAA revealed there was no 
evidence of an in-flight fire. The origin of the post crash fire, and the smoke reported by the 
pilot could not be determined. 
THE PILOTS IMPROPER USE OF BRAKES DURING A PRECAUTIONARY LANDING.
