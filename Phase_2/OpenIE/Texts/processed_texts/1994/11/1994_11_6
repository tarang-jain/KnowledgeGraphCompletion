WHILE ON A LOCAL SOLO TRAINING FLIGHT, THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH 
ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION LINES THAT WERE ABOUT 30 FEET ABOVE THE 
GROUND. THE AIRPLANE ROTATED 180 DEGREES AND CAME TO REST IN A RIVER, 
UPRIGHT AND PARTIALLY SUBMERGED. WATER DEPTH WAS ABOUT FOUR FEET.  THE 
UNINJURED, STUDENT PILOT WADED TO SHORE AND AWAITED RESCUE. HE STATED 
IN HIS REPORT THAT HE SUFFERED A TOTAL LAPSE OF JUDGEMENT, AND DECIDED 
TO BUZZ A DESERTED STRETCH OF THE RIVER. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE 
AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH THE WIRES. 
THE STUDENT PILOT'S POOR JUDGEMENT AND HIS FAILURE TO MAINTAIN 
CLEARANCE FROM OBSTACLES.
