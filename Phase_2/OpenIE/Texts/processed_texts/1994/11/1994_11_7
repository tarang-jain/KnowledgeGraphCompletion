THE FLIGHT CREW DISCONNECTED THE NUMBER ONE ENG CONSTANT SPEED DRIVE 
(CSD) DURING A FLIGHT ON THE DAY PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT WHEN ITS OIL PRESSURE 
LIGHT ILLUMINATED.  DUE TO OTHER, UNRELATED MAINTENANCE, THE AIRPLANE'S 
NEXT REVENUE FLIGHT WAS CANCELLED.  SECOND SHIFT MECHANICS WERE ASSIGNED 
MAINTENANCE ON THE AIRPLANE.  THE MECHANICS DECIDED TO TROUBLESHOOT 
THE UNIT.  THE CSD WAS MECHANICALLY RECOUPLED AND THE ENG WAS STARTED.  
AFTER THE ENG START, THE START VALVE LIGHT FAILED TO GO OUT AND THE 
ENGINE WAS SHUT DOWN.  A MECHANIC REMOVED THE MAIN CSD WIRING 
HARNESS CANNON PLUG TO HELP WITH THE TROUBLE SHOOTING PROCESS.  THE 
START VALVE WAS REPLACED AND THE ENG WAS RUNUP.  THE CSD CANNON PLUG 
WAS NOT CONNECTED AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE ENG RUNUP.  AFTER 
SHUTDOWN THE START VALVE CHANGE WAS ENTERED INTO THE AIRPLANE 
MAINTENANCE RECORDS.  THE MECHANIC WHO RECOUPLED THE CSD INFORMED 
THE LEAD MECHANIC OF HIS ACTION BEFORE HE LEFT FOR THE DAY.  ACCORDING 
TO THE COMPANY, THE THIRD SHIFT MECHANICS DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO 
CHANGE THE CSD.  THE NUMBER ONE ENG WAS '...CLOSED UP [AND] THE AIRCRAFT 
WAS DISPAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLHED.'  DURING TAXI FROM LANDING THE CSD CAUGHT FIRE. 
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
inattentive maintenance service of the airplane by the mechanic who failed to disengage the 
constant speed drive (CSD) after the engine runup had been completed.  A factor in this 
incident was the lead mechanic not performing maintenance record keeping after being 
informed that the CSD had been recoupled.
