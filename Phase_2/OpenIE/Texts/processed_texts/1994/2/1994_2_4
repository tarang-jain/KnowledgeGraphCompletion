THE PILOT STATED THAT HE WAS IN CRUISE FLIGHT WHEN HE HEARD A LOUD BANG 
FROM THE TAIL AND THE AIRPLANE ENTERED A SPIN TO THE LEFT. THE PILOT 
REGAINED CONTROL AND INITIATED A FORCED LANDING NEAR AN AIRSTRIP 
WHERE THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH TREES. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE 
RUDDER WAS BENT 90 DEGREES TO THE LEFT AND SUSPECTED THAT THE AIRPLANE 
HAD COLLIDED WITH A BIRD. A WITNESS REPORTED THAT HE OBSERVED THE 
AIRPLANE FLYING IN FORMATION WITH ANOTHER AIRPLANE WHEN A COLLISION 
OCCURRED. THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE DESCENDED RAPIDLY, WHILE THE OTHER 
AIRPLANE CONTINUED OUT OF THE AREA AND WAS NOT IDENTIFIED. 
THE PILOT FAILED TO MAINTAIN CLEARANCE WHILE MANEUVERING NEAR 
ANOTHER AIRPLANE.
