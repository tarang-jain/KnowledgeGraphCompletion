WHILE DESCENDING FOR LANDING AT BATON ROUGE, THE CAPTAIN ACTIVELY 
MOVED THE POWER LEVERS FROM THE FLIGHT IDLE GATE INTO THE BETA RANGE 
FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS. THE PROPELLERS AND ENGINES EXPERIENCED 
EXTREME OVERSPEED, NECESSITATING A POWER-OFF EMERGENCY LANDING AT 
NIGHT AND THE AIRPLANE RAN OFF THE END OF A 5,000-FT RUNWAY. ALTHOUGH 
THE DESIGN AND CERTIFICATION OF THE POWER LEVERS MET EXISTING 
REQUIREMENTS, THOSE REQUIREMENTS WERE INADEQUATE BECAUSE THEY 
PERMITTED A DESIGN THAT DID NOT PREVENT MOVEMENT INTO THE BETA RANGE 
IN FLIGHT. THE AIRFRAME AND ENGINE INDUSTRY, THE FAA, AND THE CERTIFICATION 
AUTHORITIES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WERE SLOW IN REACTING TO SEVERAL 
PREVIOUS IN-FLIGHT BETA OCCURRENCES THAT LED TO SERIOUS INCIDENTS AND 
ACCIDENTS. 
THE CAPTAIN'S MOVEMENT OF THE POWER LEVERS BELOW FLIGHT IDLE IN FLIGHT, 
THE INADEQUATE CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND CONSEQUENT DESIGN OF 
THE AIRPLANE'S POWER LEVERS THAT PERMITTED THEM TO BE MOVED BELOW THE 
FLIGHT IDLE POSITION INTO THE BETA RANGE, EITHER INTENTIONALLY OR 
INADVERTENTLY, WHILE IN FLIGHT, AND THE INADEQUATE ACTION TAKEN TO 
REQUIRE A POSITIVE MEANS TO PREVENT BETA OPERATION ON AIRPLANES FOR 
WHICH SUCH OPERATION IS PROHIBITED. (NTSB REPORT AAR=94/06)
