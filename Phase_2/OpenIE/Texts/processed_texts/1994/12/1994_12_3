THE AIRCRAFT WAS BEING OPERATED AS A FLIGHT OF TWO ON A FERRY FLIGHT 
FROM THE MARSHALL ISLANDS TO HONOLULU, HAWAII. THE AIRPLANE WAS 
EQUIPPED WITH AUXILIARY FUEL TANKS AND WAS OPERATED ON A SPECIAL 
AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATE THAT ALLOWED FOR 10 PERCENT OVER GROSS 
WEIGHT OPERATIONS.  ABOUT 2 HOURS AFTER DEPARTURE, WHILE AT AN ALTITUDE 
OF 7,000 FEET MEAN SEA LEVEL, THE ACCOMPANYING AIRPLANE NOTICED SMOKE 
TRAILING FROM THE LEFT ENGINE OF THE ACCIDENT AIRCRAFT.  THE TWO 
AIRCRAFT TURNED AROUND AND THE PILOT DECLARED AN EMERGENCY.  THE LEFT 
ENGINE OF THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE QUIT AND THE PILOT FEATHERED THE 
PROPELLER.  THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN LEVEL FLIGHT AND THE 
AIRCRAFT WAS DITCHED IN ROUGH WATER AND SUBSEQUENTLY SANK. THE PILOT 
WAS RESCUED ABOUT 20 HOURS AFTERWARDS. 
An undetermined failure of the left engine.  The inability of the airplane to maintain level flight 
and exceeding the one-engine capability was a factor in the accident.
