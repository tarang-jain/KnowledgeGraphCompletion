THE FLIGHT HAD BEEN AIRBORNE FOR TWO MINUTES WHEN THE PILOT 
REQUESTED LANDING PERMISSION STATING, IN PART, 'I'D LIKE TO PROCEED 
INBOUND...SINGLE ENGINE LANDING, PLEASE.' HE CANCELLED THIS REQUEST 
IMMEDIATELY AND REPORTED '...I'M GOING DOWN AT THIS TIME.' HE THEN 
CONTACTED THE DISPAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLH WHERE HE HAD DEPARTED AND REPORTED THE 
POSITION OF HIS INTENDED LANDING. AFTER THIS RADIO CALL, 23 TO 25 SECONDS 
PASSED BEFORE HIS LAST COMMUNICATION INDICATING AN IMMINENT CRASH. 
WITNESSES REPORTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS NEARLY SILENT JUST PRIOR TO 
GROUND IMPACT AND THAT THERE WAS NO ENGINE NOISE AT ALL AFTER IMPACT. 
SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT NEITHER ENGINE WAS OPERATING 
AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT; HOWEVER, NO MECHANICAL REASON FOR THE 
LOSS OF ENGINE POWER OR NECESSITY FOR AN ENGINE SHUTDOWN BY THE PILOT 
WAS DETERMINED. DAMAGE TO THE ROTOR SYSTEM INDICATED THAT RPM WAS 
EXTREMELY LOW AT THE TIME OF IMPACT. 
the pilot's failure to obtain/maintain a successful autorotation.  Factors were: a loss of engine 
power of one engine for undetermined reasons, and the pilot's shutdown of the wrong engine.
