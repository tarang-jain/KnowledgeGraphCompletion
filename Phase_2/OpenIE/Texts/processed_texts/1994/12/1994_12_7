THE PILOT WAS CONDUCTING THE FOURTH TOUCH AND GO LANDING, UNDER THE 
SUPERVISION OF AN INSTRUCTOR PILOT, WHEN THE RIGHT MAIN LANDING GEAR 
FAILED. FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE OF THE LANDING GEAR THE AIRCRAFT VEERED 
RIGHT OF THE RUNWAY AND GROUND LOOPED. AN EXAMINATION OF THE LANDING 
GEAR REVEALED A PRE-EXISTING CRACK IN A WELD AREA. THE PILOT HAD 
RECENTLY PURCHASED THE AIRCRAFT. 
THE INADEQUATE MAINTENANCE BY UNKNOWN MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL. A 
FACTOR WAS THE COLLAPSED LANDING GEAR.
