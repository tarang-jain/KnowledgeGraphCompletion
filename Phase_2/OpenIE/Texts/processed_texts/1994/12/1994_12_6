THE EXPERIMENTAL AIRPLANE WAS PERFORMING TOUCH AND GO LANDINGS.  THE 
ENGINE WAS A 330 HORSEPOWER BUICK V-8, APPROVED FOR THE USE OF 
AUTOMOTIVE GASOLINE FUEL.  THE LOCATION OR TIME OF THE LAST REFUELING IS 
UNKNOWN.  SEVERAL WITNESSES DESCRIBED A CESSATION OF ENGINE NOISE, AND 
THE AIRPLANE DESCENDING VERTICALLY IN A SPIN.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF 
ROTATION ON THE PROPELLER AT IMPACT, AND WATER WAS FOUND IN THE 
CARBURETOR. 
The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane, resulting in a stall-spin.  Factors were an 
inadequate preflight and the loss of engine power resulting from water contamination in the 
automotive fuel.
