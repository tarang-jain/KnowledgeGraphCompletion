THE PURPOSE OF THE FLIGHT WAS TO ENTERTAIN A NON-PILOT MEMBER OF THE 
GENERAL PUBLIC BY PERMITTING HIM TO FLY HANDS-ON A HIGH PERFORMANCE 
MILITARY FIGHTER-LIKE LIGHT AIRPLANE DURING A SIMULATED DOG FIGHT. THE 
OPERATOR HAD EQUIPPED THE AIRPLANE WITH A VIDEO RECORDER FROM WHICH 
BOTH COCKPIT AUDIO AND VIDEO DATA WAS PRESERVED. THE PASSENGER WAS 
CALLED A 'GUEST FIGHTER PILOT,' AND HE WAS HANDLING THE FLIGHT CONTROLS 
DURING A SIMULATED AIR COMBAT MANEUVER INITIATED AROUND 5,500 FEET 
MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL). THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND (PIC) ISSUED REPEATED VERBAL 
WARNINGS TO THE PASSENGER TO 'STAY OUT OF THE BUFFET.' HOWEVER, DURING 
A LEFT CLIMBING TURN THE PASSENGER STALLED THE AIRPLANE AND IT BEGAN 
SPINNING.  AS THE AIRPLANE DESCENDED IN THE SPIN, THE PIC TOLD THE 
PASSENGER THREE TIMES 'I'VE GOT THE AIRPLANE.' THE AIRPLANE IMPACTED 3,600 
TO 3,700-FOOT MSL TERRAIN IN A NOSE LOW AND WINGS LEVEL ATTITUDE DURING 
THE INITIATION OF THE PULLUP RECOVERY.  THE PIC WAS AN EX-MILITARY 
FIGHTER PILOT AND HIS CIVILIAN FLYING EXPERIENCE IN THE AIRPLANE WITH 
PASSENGERS WAS LIMITED, HAVING ONLY ACQUIRED EMPLOYMENT WITH THE 
OPERATOR 1.5 MONTHS EARLIER. THE PIC DID NOT HOLD A CFI CERTIFICATE. 
the pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane by inadvertently allowing the flying 
passenger to enter a stall/spin.  Factors in the accident were the passenger's interference with 
the pilot's attempted recovery from the spin, and the pilot's lack of experience in small general 
aviation airplanes.
