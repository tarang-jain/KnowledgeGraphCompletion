The pilot reported that he was in cruise flight at 5,000 feet agl and had slowed to 70 mph. The 
passenger stated that she was taking off her headset and moving her seat back so she could get 
a good photograph. The pilot heard what sounded like a yell, and simultaneously felt wind and 
noise in the cabin. He looked towards the sound, and observed the passenger partially out of 
the airplane. When their eyes met, she jumped. Review of AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL transcripts verified that the 
pilot departed and returned to the departure airport without any intermediate stops. Another 
pilot wrote a letter to the Safety Board describing a similar incident that occurred 4 days prior 
to the accident with the same passenger. During that flight, she unlatched the door gunner's 
safety belt while sitting on the floor with her feet outside the airplane on the landing gear. At 
the time, she was wearing a parachute with a hidden automatic opener on the reserve 
parachute. She was subsequently pulled back into the airplane by a safety crewmember and 
restrained for the return flight. The passenger's airman and medical certificates had been 
revoked 8/12/91 for failing to disclose a history of, among other conditions, a personality 
disorder and for the taking of numerous prescribed medications. 
The passenger committed suicide.
