WHILE EN ROUTE FROM DEMING, NM, TO WACO, TX, THE PILOT ENCOUNTERED 
DETERIORATING WEATHER AND ELECTED TO DIVERT TO BROWNWOOD, TX, HIS 
ALTERNATE. PRIOR TO HIS DEPARTURE FROM DEMING, NEW MEXICO, HE HAD 
RECEIVED A COMPLETE WEATHER BRIEFING. THE BRIEFER INFORMED HIM THAT 
THE WEATHER ALONG HIS PROPOSED ROUTE OF FLIGHT WOULD BE 
DETERIORATING. THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE THE ALTERNATE AIRPORT 
DUE TO REDUCED VISIBILITY AND THE LIGHT CONDITIONS, SO HE DECIDED TO 
LAND IN A COW PASTURE. DURING THE LANDING ROLL, THE AIRPLANE STRUCK A 
BARBED WIRE FENCE AND NOSED OVER INTO A CREEK. 
THE PILOT'S ATTEMPTED FLIGHT INTO KNOWN ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS. 
FACTORS WERE THE UNSUITABLE TERRAIN, REDUCED VISIBILITY DUE FOG AND 
LOW CEILINGS, AND THE REDUCED LIGHT CONDITIONS.
