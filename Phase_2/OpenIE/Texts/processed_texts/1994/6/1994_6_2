THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE GLIDER SUDDENLY PITCHED UP AS HE DESCENDED 
THROUGH THE 'START GATE' AT A GLIDER COMPETITION.  HE ADMITTED THAT THE 
PITCH-UP WAS 'PROBABLY PILOT INDUCED.'  HE STATED THAT HE THEN HEARD A 
LOUD CRACKING NOISE AND HIS HAND-HELD RADIO FELL LOOSE IN THE COCKPIT.  
HE ATTEMPTED TO RETRIEVE THE RADIO, BUT IT BROKE THROUGH THE CANOPY.  
THE PILOT DECIDED TO EXIT THE AIRPLANE AFTER FAILED ATTEMPTS TO REGAIN 
CONTROL.  HE RELEASED HIMSELF FROM THE SEAT RESTRAINTS AND FELL 
THROUGH THE PLEXIGLASS CANOPY.  HE DEPLOYED HIS PARACHUTE AND LANDED 
IN A TREE, AND THEN FELL FROM THE TREE ONTO THE GROUND, CAUSING SERIOUS 
INJURIES.  THE UNMANNED GLIDER IMPACTED TERRAIN INVERTED AND WAS 
SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED.  NO MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS WITH THE FLIGHT 
CONTROLS, CANOPY, OR SEAT RESTRAINT SYSTEMS WERE FOUND. 
THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE 
DURING THE MANEUVER.
