THE STUDENT PILOT REPORTED THAT HE USED HIS FATHER'S AIRPLANE TO 
PRACTICE FLYING IN PREPARATION FOR THE FAA FLIGHT EXAM.  HE LANDED ON A 
DIRT AIRSTRIP AND THEN ATTEMPTED TO TAKE OFF.  ACCORDING TO THE STUDENT, 
AS THE AIRPLANE WAS LIFTING OFF AT AN AIRSPEED OF ABOUT 70 KNOTS, THE 
AIRPLANE DRIFTED LEFT AND COLLIDED WITH A TREE NEAR THE RUNWAY.  THE 
PILOT HAD NOT RECEIVED DUAL FLIGHT INSTRUCTION IN 5 MONTHS, AND HAD NOT 
RECEIVED A LOGBOOK ENDORSEMENT AUTHORIZING SOLO FLYING IN 7 MONTHS. 
THE STUDENT PILOT'S FAILURE TO PROPERLY ALIGN THE AIRPLANE'S FLIGHTPATH 
OVER THE RUNWAY DURING INITIAL CLIMB. A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR WAS THE 
STUDENT PILOT'S TOTAL LACK OF RECENT FLYING EXPERIENCE.
