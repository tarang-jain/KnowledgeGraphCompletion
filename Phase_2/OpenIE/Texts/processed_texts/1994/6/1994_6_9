     THE PILOT HAD RETURNED AFTER AN UNEVENTFUL 40-MINUTE FLIGHT WITH A 
PASSENGER.  ABOUT 15 MINUTES LATER, AFTER THE PASSENGER HAD 
DISEMBARKED, THE PILOT TOOK OFF AGAIN.  WITNESSES OBSERVED THE 
AIRPLANE'S TAKEOFF ROLL AND REPORTED NOTHING UNUSUAL.  DURING THE 
INITIAL CLIMB, THE AIRPLANE WAS OBSERVED TO DRIFT TO THE LEFT AND 
SUDDENLY PITCH DOWN AS ITS WINGS ROCKED BACK AND FORTH.  THE AIRPLANE 
STALLED AND DESCENDED INTO TERRAIN IN A NOSE-DOWN ATTITUDE.  AN 
EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE DID NOT REVEAL ANY EVIDENCE OF PRE-IMPACT 
MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS OR FAILURES.  AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, THE 
SUN WAS POSITIONED NEAR THE DIRECTION OF THE TAKEOFF. 
THE FAILURE OF THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE AIRSPEED.  
THIS LED TO A STALL DURING THE INITIAL TAKEOFF AND CLIMB AT AN ALTITUDE 
THAT DID NOT PERMIT A RECOVERY.  A FACTOR RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WAS 
THE PRESENCE OF SUNGLARE DURING THE TAKEOFF, WHICH RESTRICTED VISUAL 
CUES.
