The instructor and student had completed instrument instruction and afterwards, the student, 
who was a private pilot, requested and they practiced crosswind landings.  According to the 
instructor 'I was distracted by his perfomance and remiss in verification of fuel status in 
execution of before landing checklist.  Power was lost on climbout. Additional check futile. 
Committed to off-field landing.  Damage occurred on rollout through a ditch in terrain.' The 
FAA examined the airplane and revealed the left fuel tank was empty.  An undetermined 
amount of fuel was in the right tank. 
The pilot's mismanagement of the fuel supply with an improper fuel selector position which 
resulted in fuel starvation and the loss of engine power.  A factor is the instructor's inadequate 
supervision of the flight.
