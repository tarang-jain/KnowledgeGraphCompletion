THE PILOT STATED HE OVERFLEW THE LANDING AREA AND DID NOT SEE ANY 
OBSTRUCTION.  HE TOUCHED DOWN ON THE LANDING AREA INTENDING TO 'DRAG 
THE LANDING AREA' BUT BECAUSE THE LANDING WAS SMOOTH HE ELECTED TO 
REMAIN ON THE GROUND. APPROXIMATELY 2/3 OF THE WAY DOWN THE LANDING 
AREA HE SAW A DITCH AND THE AIRPLANE STRUCK THE DITCH.  HE STATED HE WAS 
TOO SLOW TO ATTEMPT A GO AROUND AND HE WAS UNABLE TO STOP THE 
AIRPLANE. THE MAIN GEAR SEPARATED FROM THE FUSELAGE AND THE PLANE 
SKIDDED TO A STOP. 
THE PILOT'S SELECTION OF AN UNSUITABLE LANDING AREA.
