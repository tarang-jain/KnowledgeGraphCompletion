DURING THE TAKEOFF ROLL, THE PILOT REPORTED A VIBRATION IN THE 
TAILWHEEL ASSEMBLY. HE CONTINUED THE TAKEOFF PROCEDURE BUT ELECTED 
TO RETURN TO THE AIRPORT FOR A PRECAUTIONARY LANDING BEFORE DISPENSING 
OR DUMPING THE 1500 POUNDS OF CHEMICALS. AT TOUCHDOWN THE TAILWHEEL 
ASSEMBLY COLLAPSED AND SEPARATED FROM THE AIRFRAME. THE PILOT LOST 
CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE AS IT SKIDDED TO A STOP ON THE RUNWAY. 
EXAMINATION OF THE AIRCRAFT FAILED TO DISCLOSE A MATERIAL FAILURE OR 
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION. ACCORDING TO THE OPERATOR, THE PILOT HAD NOT MADE 
A LANDING WITH THE AIRPLANE IN A HEAVY OR LOADED CONFIGURATION WITHIN 
THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. THE OPERATOR HAD NO FORMAL EMERGENCY 
DUMP POLICY TO PREVENT LANDING WITH CHEMICALS ONBOARD DURING AN 
EMERGENCY. 
THE PILOT'S IMPROPER LANDING FLARE WHICH RESULTED IN A HARD LANDING. A 
FACTOR WAS THE OPERATORS FAILURE TO PROVIDE A FORMAL EMERGENCY DUMP 
PROCEDURE.
