The pilot stated 'Upon takeoff, the engine died.  I believe from fuel starvation.'  The airplane 
was substantially damaged during the emergency landing to a rocky ravine.  The pilot reported

the pilot's failure to visually check the fuel quantity during the preflight inspection.  A factor 
was the unsuitable terrain for the forced landing. 
 On May 1, 1996, at 1300 central daylight time, a Piper PA-28, N9869K, registered to and 
operated by a private owner as a Title 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight, was substantially 
damaged during a forced landing following a loss of engine power during takeoff.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed.  The private pilot and his 
passenger received minor injuries.  The flight originated from a private airstrip near Mountain 
Home, Arkansas.
Shortly after takeoff, at approximately 100 feet AGL, the engine lost power.  During the 
emergency landing to a rocky ravine, the fuselage and both wings were damaged.  Both fuel 
tanks were compromised.
The pilot reported that during his preflight inspection, he did not visually check the fuel 
quantity.  The airplane had been fueled 5 days earlier, and approximately 2 to 3 hours had been 
flown since then.  The pilot also reported that the accident "possibl[y] could have been 
prevented by a more thorough preflight."  He further reported that he did not know, at the time 
of departure, what the total fuel on board was.  The pilot stated that "upon takeoff, the engine 
died. I believe from fuel starvation."
Inspection of the airplane by the pilot revealed that the fuel sump valve was missing.  The pilot 
reported that "the interior threads inside the AN fitting were all intact."  However, the attached 
photograph shows thread damage.
