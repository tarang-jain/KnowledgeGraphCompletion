The certified flight instructor (CFI) stated the airplane hit a bump on the takeoff roll, and 
became airborne prematurely. The airplane veered to the right at a very slow airspeed. At that 
point, the CFI elected to continue the takeoff, rather than land. He lowered the nose to gain 
airspeed; however, he was unable to attain sufficient airspeed and altitude to clear trees that 
were ahead. The airplane collided with the trees, then impacted the terrain. 
failure of the flight instructor (CFI) to maintain directional control of the airplane during 
takeoff, when the airplane encountered an uneven area on the airstrip and becoming airborne 
prematurely; and his failure to maintain clearance (or altitude) from trees, which were adjacent 
to the airstrip.  The uneven surface of the airstrip and proximity of trees were related factors. 
 On May 1, 1996, at about 1915 eastern daylight time, a Piper PA-22-135, N1209C, 
registered to a private owner, operating as a 14 CFR Part 91 instructional flight crashed on 
initial takeoff climb in the vicinity of Cochran, Georgia. Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The commercial pilot/certified flight instructor and 
student pilot reported no injuries. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The flight 
originated from Wimberly Strip, Cochran, Georgia, about 1 minute before the accident. 
The certified flight instructor stated  the airplane hit a bump on the takeoff roll, and 
became airborne prematurely. The airplane veered to the right at a very slow airspeed. He 
lowered the nose to gain airspeed, however he did not obtain the proper climb rate. The 
airplane collided with trees and crashed into the terrain.
