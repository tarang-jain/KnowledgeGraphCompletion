After completing a fish spotting flight, the pilot landed the airplane at the Dillingham Airport. 
While taxiing back from landing, the pilot applied the brakes. During the deceleration, a tire 
rotated on the rim shearing the valve stem. The tire and portions of the rim separated from the

rotation (slippage) of the tire on the rim, and shearing of the valve stem, which allowed the rim 
to contact the ground and then separate. 
 On May 1, 1996, at 1200 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Cessna 170 airplane, 
N1828C, registered to and operated by the pilot, lost a tire while taxiing after landing and 
dragged a wingtip at the Dillingham Airport, Dillingham, Alaska.  The business flight, 
operating under 14 CFR Part 91 for the purpose of fish spotting, departed Togiak, Alaska, and 
the destination was Dillingham.  No flight plan was filed and visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed.  The certificated commercial pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured and the 
airplane received substantial damage.
During a telephone conversation with the pilot on May 4, 1996, he stated that after 
landing, while taxiing to the ramp and applying the brakes, the tire rotated on the rim and 
sheared off the valve stem.  The tire and rim then separated from the landing gear and the 
wingtip dragged the ground. 
According to the NTSB form 6120.1/2, submitted by the pilot, he stated that the bonding 
failed and the rim separated.  He did not submit the rim for examination.  The airplane was 
equipped with 8:50 size tires.
