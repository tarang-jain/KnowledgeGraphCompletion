The pilot and two passengers were departing on a cross-country on-demand charter flight. The 
airplane was 120 pounds below maximum gross weight. The pilot departed runway 11, but after 
lift off, the airplane would not climb. The airplane collided with snow covered tundra terrain 
about 1/8 mile from the departure end of the runway. The operator indicated the pilot and a 
mechanic passenger observed the airplane lights flicker on and off, and smelled an odor of 
overheated electrical wiring. An inspection of the airplane by the FAA did not reveal any 
mechanical malfunction. The wind conditions at the airport, from just before and just after the 
accident, varied from 300 to 312 degrees at 9 knots. 
the pilot's improper planning/decision, and resultant failure to obtain/maintain sufficient 
airspeed during takeoff.  A factor related the accident was: taking off with a tailwind.
