The pilot reported she was attempting to land at an off airport beach site with a load of cargo.  
The airplane bounced on the initial touchdown.  On the following touchdown, the pilot said she 
became concerned about the proximity of the water at the end of the landing area and applied 
the brakes.  The airplane decelerated, and then nosed over. 
The pilot's excessive application of the brakes during the landing roll. 
 On August 2, 1996, about 1349 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Cessna 185 airplane, 
N20752, owned and operated by Cape Smythe Air Service, sustained substantial damage while 
landing at Point Franklin, located about 25 miles northeast of  Wainwright, Alaska. The solo 
airline transport certificated pilot was not injured.  The 14 CFR Part 135 cargo flight operated 
in visual meteorological conditions.  The flight originated at Barrow, Alaska, about 1300.
According to a written statement issued by the pilot, she said she was landing on hard sand in 
light and variable wind conditions. The airplane bounced on landing, and touched down again 
in a tail low attitude. She then applied the brakes because she was concerned about the water 
in front of her. The tail of the airplane rose, and the airplane nosed over onto the sandy landing 
surface.
The Director of Operations for the operator described the landing area as a section of leveled 
beach situated behind sand dunes.
