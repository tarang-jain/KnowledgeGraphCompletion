 On August 1, 1996, about 1308 central daylight time, a Cessna 172N, N737DK, registered 
to Dayton Aviation Inc., leased by Air Venture Flying Club, operating as a 14 CFR Part 91 
personal flight,  experienced a loss of engine power in cruise flight in the vicinity of Victoria, 
Mississippi, and crashed.   Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a visual rules flight 
plan was filed. The airplane sustained substantial damage, and the pilot reported minor 
injuries. The flight originated from Columbia, Mississippi, 2 hours 26 minutes before the 
accident.
The pilot stated he initially departed New Orleans, Louisiana, en route for Olive Branch, 
Mississippi, and diverted into Columbia, Mississippi due to weather. He obtained a weather 
briefing and departed for his destination airport. He was in cruise flight at 4,000 feet, in 
contact with Memphis  tower, when the engine quit. He informed Memphis  tower that he had 
run out of gas. He made a forced landing to an open field. The airplane collided with trees on 
the final approach, nosed over, and came to rest inverted.
Examination of the airframe, flight controls, and engine assembly revealed no evidence 
of a precrash mechanical failure or malfunction. The left and right fuel tanks were not 
ruptured. About  1 1/2 gallons of fuel was drained from the right fuel tank, and about 3 quarts 
of fuel was drained from the left fuel tank.
