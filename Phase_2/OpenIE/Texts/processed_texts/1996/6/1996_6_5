During a dual instructional lesson, the CFI initiated a practice autorotation from 1,000 feet 
above ground level (agl) while in the traffic pattern.  The CFI reported that as the helicopter 
descended through 800 feet agl, all engine power was suddenly lost and the practice maneuver 
turned into a forced landing.  Just prior to experiencing the engine power loss, all instruments 
had been in the green.  The CFI further stated that the helicopter touched down softly at the 
approach end of the runway with a forward speed between 2 and 3 miles per hour.  Thereafter, 
the helicopter tipped forward, shook violently, and the main rotor blade contacted the airframe 
which resulted in substantial damage.
