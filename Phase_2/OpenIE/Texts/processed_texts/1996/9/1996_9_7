According to the operator, during the landing on a private ag-strip, a slight crosswind resulted 
in the airplane diverting into an adjacent cotton field.  The airplane bounced across soft crop 
rows for 60 feet to 70 feet until the left landing gear collapsed, at which point the left wing 
struck the ground and the motor/prop struck the ground subsequently flipping the aircraft 
completely over. 
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing roll.  A factor was the 
crosswind. 
 On September 1, 1996, at 1145 central daylight time, an Air Tractor AT-401, N1502F, was 
substantially damaged during landing near Brownfield, Texas.  The commercial pilot, the sole 
occupant of the airplane, was not injured.  The airplane was registered to and operated by 
Foshee Flying Service under Title 14 CFR Part 137.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed 
for the local aerial application flight which originated from a private Ag-strip approximately 45 
minutes before the accident.  A flight plan was not filed.
The operator stated, in the NTSB Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report, that during the 
landing on a private ag-strip, a "slight crosswind" resulted in the airplane diverting into an 
adjacent cotton field.  "The plane was bouncing across soft crop rows for 60 feet to 70 feet until 
the left landing gear collapsed, at which point the left wing struck the ground and the 
motor/prop struck the ground subsequently flipping the aircraft completely over."
