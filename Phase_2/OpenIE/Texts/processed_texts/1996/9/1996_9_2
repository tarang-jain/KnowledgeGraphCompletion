 On September 1, 1996, at 2400 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Piper PA-18 
airplane, N4393Z, registered to Allen Douglas Hulen, of Anchorage, Alaska, and operated by 
the pilot, crashed during takeoff from an off airport site adjacent to the Theodore River, located 
near Tyonek, Alaska.  The personal flight, operating  under 14 CFR Part 91, was departing 
during dusk, and the destination was Anchorage, Alaska.  No flight plan was filed and visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed.  The certificated private pilot and the passenger were not 
injured.  The airplane was substantially damaged.
During a telephone conversation with the pilot, he stated that he was taking off from a 
road near the Theodore River.  The airplane became airborne prematurely and drifted off the 
right side of the road.  He was unable to stop the drift, despite the application of full left aileron 
and rudder.  The left wing struck the muskeg and the airplane settled into the brush.  He stated 
that the airplane was not ready to fly, and believes the right wing stalled.
