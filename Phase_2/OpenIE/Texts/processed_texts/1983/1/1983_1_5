PILOT CHECKED BRAKING ON ICY SOD RUNWAY BEFORE TAKEOFF AND IT SEEMED 
TO BE ALL RIGHT. UPON RETURNING TO LAND THE PILOT NOTICED A FARMER 
DRIVING CATTLE NEAR THE LANDING THRESHOLD SO HE DECIDED TO LAND LONG 
INSTEAD OF GOING AROUND. USING HALF FLAPS HE LANDED 835 FEET DOWN THE 
2200 FOOT RUNWAY. AFTER LANDING HE DISCOVERED BRAKING WAS NOT 
HOLDING. HE BRACED HIMSELF AND SLID OFF THE END OF THE RUNWAY. THE 
AIRCRAFT WENT OVER A DIKE AND INTO A DITCH. THE ICY RUNWAY WAS 
PARTIALLYMELTED AND MORE SLIPPERY THAN IT HAD BEEN BEFORE TAKEOFF.
