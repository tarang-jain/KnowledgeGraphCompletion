THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH THE TOP TWO WIRES OF A POWERLINE DURING A 
LOW ALTITUDE SIGHT-SEEING FLIGHT ALONG THE POTOMAC RIVER. THE PILOT 
STATED HE WAS MAINTAINING VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE GROUND SHOULD AN 
EMERGENCY LANDING BECOME NECESSARY. HE WAS STAYING HIGH ENOUGH FOR 
CLEARANCE OF THE TREES. HE STATED THAT APPARENTLY THE TERRAIN WAS 
GETTING HIGHER WITHOUT HIS AWARENESS AND SUDDENLY THE WIRES BECAME 
VISIBLE JUST BEFORE THE COLLISION. ONE WIRE CONTACTED THE LANDING GEAR 
AND THE AIRCRAFT PITCHED DOWN OUT OF CONTROL AND CRASHED ON A ROCKY LEDGE 
ON AN ISLAND IN THE RIVER. THE FREE END OF ONE OF THE WIRES RECOILED 
ONTO HIGHWAY I-70 AND STRUCK TWO CARS CAUSING MINOR INJURIES TO 2 
PERSONS.
