THE ENGINE LOST POWER WHEN THE PILOT WAS ON AN EXTENDED BASE LEG FOR 
LANDING. FROM THAT POSITION, HE COULD NOT GLIDE TO THE RUNWAY, SO HE 
ELECTED TO LAND ON A NEARBY BEACH. THE LOCATION OF PEOPLE WALKING ON 
THE BEACH PREVENTED AN UPWIND LANDING, SO THE PILOT TURNED TO LAND 
DOWNWIND. THIS REQUIRED A STEEP TURN AT LOW ALTITUDE TO AVOID LANDING 
IN THE OCEAN. THE PILOT STATED THAT THE UPPER WING MAY HAVE STALLED 
SOMEWHAT AS THERE WAS VIRTUALLY NO CONTROL FOR THE LAST 20 FEET OF 
DESCENT. THE PLANE LANDED ON THE BEACH ON ALL THREE WHEELS, BUT THE 
NOSE AND RIGHT MAIN GEAR COLLAPSED. AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE 
CARBURETOR CHAMBERS AND FUEL FILTER BOWL CONTAINED WATER.
