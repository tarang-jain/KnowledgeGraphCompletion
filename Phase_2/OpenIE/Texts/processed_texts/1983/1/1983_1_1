THE AIRCRAFEET COLLIDED WITH A FOUR FEET SNOWBANK AT THE RUNWAY THRESHOLD DURING 
LANDING. THIS WAS A DUAL INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT WITH THE STUDENT IN THE 
RIGHT SEAT. THE CFI HAD MADE NO LANDINGS IN THIS MAKE AND MODEL OF AIRCRAFT 
IN THE PREVIOUS 90 DAYS. THE PILOT STATED THAT DUE TO THE LIGHTING AND 
SNOW IN THE BACKGROUND THE DEFINITION OF THE SNOWBANK WAS HARD TO 
DISTINGUISH DURING THE APPROACH.
