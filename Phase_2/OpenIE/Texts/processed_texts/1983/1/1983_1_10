PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT THE AIRCRAFT FLEW OVER THE ARPT AT TREE-TOP LEVEL 
WITH THE GEAR RETRACTED. THE AIRCRAFT THEN LANDED. AFTER SPENDING ABOUT 15 
MIN ON THE GROUND THE PILOTS TOOK OFF TO THE WEST. THE GEAR WAS 
RETRACTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER TAKEOFF AND THE AIRCRAFT REMAINED BETWEEN 
TREE-TOP LEVEL AND 500 FEET AGL EXECUTING STEEP BANKS. A WITNESS DESCRIBED 
THE SECOND STEEP BANK AS THOUGH THE PILOT WAS EXECUTING A BARREL ROLL. 
THE AIRCRAFT NEVER RECOVERED FROM THE BANK AND DESCENDED RAPIDLY TO THE 
GROUND.
