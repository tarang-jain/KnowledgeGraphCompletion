THIS WAS THE FIRST FLIGHT OF THE HOMEBUILT. SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF THE 
ENG QUIT DUE TO INADEQUATE GROUNDING. THE PILOT RETURNED TO THE FIELD AND 
MADE A SMOOTH LANDING. AT THE END OF THE ROLL OUT THE ANCHOR PLATE FOR 
THE LANDING GEAR TRUSS FAILED CAUSING THE LEFT GEAR TO COLLAPSE. THE PILOT 
STATED THAT THE 3/4 INCH X 0.049, 4130 SQUARE TUBING USED FOR THE ANCHOR 
PLATE WAS TOO LIGHT TO CARRY THE AIRCRAFT LOADING AND THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN 
PREVIOUSLY CRACKED FROM HIGH SPEED TAXI TESTS.
