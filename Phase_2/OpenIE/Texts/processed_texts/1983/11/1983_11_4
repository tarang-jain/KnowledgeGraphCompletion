AFTER REFUELING AT ITHACA, NY, THE PILOTS OF TWO PIPER PA-28 AIRCRAFT DEPARTED 
AS A FLIGHT OF TWO. THEY HAD PLANNED TO CONTINUE THEIR FLIGHT BACK TO 
CINCINNATI, OH WITH ANOTHER EN ROUTE STOP AT COLUMBUS, OH. THE NON-
INSTRUMENT RATED PILOT OF N8163P WAS FOLLOWING THE LEAD AIRCRAFT, N6888W. 
AFTER CHECKING THE WX AND OBSERVING LIGHTNING AHEAD, THE FLIGHT LEADER 
RADIOED THAT HE WAS TURNING BACK TO BRADFORE, PA TO LAND. AT THIS TIME 
(1915 EST) IT WAS DARK AND THE AIRCRAFEET WERE AT ABOUT 3000 TO 3300 FEET MSL. THE #2 
PILOT TRIED TO KEEP THE LEAD AIRCRAFT IN SIGHT, DURING THE TURN, BUT WAS 
UNSUCCESSFUL. WHILE SEARCHING FOR THE LEAD PLANE, THE #2 PILOT BECAME 
DISORIENTED AND LOST CONTROL OF HIS AIRCRAFT. DURING THE ATTEMPTED RECOVERY, 
THE AIRCRAFEET COLLIDED WITH TREES ON THE CREST OF A HILL AT APPROXIMATELY 2240 FEET MSL. 
THE AIRCRAFT WAS DESTROYED, BUT THE 2 OCCUPANTS OF THAT AIRCRAFT RECEIVED ONLY 
MINOR INJURIES. THEY SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE FOREST.
