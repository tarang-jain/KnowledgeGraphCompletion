DURING THE FLIGHT, HYDRAULIC FAILURE OF THE LANDING SYS OCCURRED AND THE 
AIRCREW WERE UNABLE TO GET THE GEAR LOCKED IN THE DOWN POSITION. AFTER 
ORBITING FOR OVER AN HOUR, A LANDING WAS MADE. DURING TOUCHDOWN, THE 
GEAR COLLAPSED. AN EXAM REVEALED THAT AN AILERON BALANCE CABLE HAD 
CHAFED AGAINST A HYDRAULIC LINE IN THE LANDING GEAR SYS UNTIL A HOLE WAS 
WORN THRU THE LINE. THIS ALLOWED THE HYDRAULIC FLUID TO LEAK OUT.
