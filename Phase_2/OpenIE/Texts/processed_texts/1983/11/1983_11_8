THE PILOT HAD JUST PURCHASED THE AIRCRAFT AND FLEW A PREVIOUS CO-OWNER TO 
MONTPELIER, IN, WHERE HE LANDED AT ABOUT DUSK. THE PREVIOUS CO-OWNER 
DEPLANED. HE SAID THAT AFTER THE AIRCRAFT TOOK OFF, HE SAW IT TURN TO THE 
WEST AND DEPART TOWARD MARION. A SHORT TIME LATER, THE AIRCRAFT WAS OBSERVED 
BY NUMEROUS RESIDENTS, CIRCLING OVER PORTLAND, IN, APPROXIMATELY 16 MI SOUTHEAST 
OF MONTELIER, AT LOW ALT. THE RESIDENTS REPORTED THAT IT WAS MAKING 
FREQUENT DIVES, CLIMBS AND CIRCLES AT LOW ALTITUDES. AT APPROXIMATELY 1830, IT 
CRASHED WHILE IN A STEEP DIVE. AN EXAM OF THE WRECKAGE WAS MADE, BUT NO 
PREIMPACT MALFUNCTION OR FAILURE WAS FOUND. HOWEVER, THERE WAS 
EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT AND EVIDENCE THAT IT HAD IMPACTED AT A HIGH 
RATE OF SPEED. PATHOLOGICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL EXAMS REVEALED NO 
SIGNIFICATNT FACTORS.
