THE PILOT STATED THAT HE CIRCLED AND LOOKED FOR WIRES AND OBSTRUCTIONS PRIOR 
TO SPRAYING. DURING A RUN HE FLEW OVER A FIRST SET OF WIRES BUT STRUCK A 
SECOND SET OF WIRES WHICH WERE NOT MARKED AND THE POLES WERE DIFFICULT 
TO SEE BECAUSE THEY WERE IN TREES. FROM THE DIRECTION THE AIRCRAFT WAS 
FLYING, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR THE PILOT TO SEE THE WIRES THE 
AIRCRAFT STRUCK.
