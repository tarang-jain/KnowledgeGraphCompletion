THE CFI STATED THAT WHILE PRACTICING EMERGENCY LANDINGS, SMOKE 
STARTED BILLOWING INTO THE COCKPIT. SHE ALSO NOTICED A LOT OF HEAT NEAR 
HER LEGS. THINKING THAT THERE MIGHT BE A FIRE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
FIREWALL, THE CFI DECIDED TO LAND IN A CORN FIELD. THE CORN WAS 12 FEET TALL 
AND THE AIRCRAFT NOSED OVER ON ITS BACK. THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF SMOKE, HEAT OR 
FIRE WAS THAT THE WIRE LEAD FROM THE ELECTRICAL BUS BAR TO A RADIO WAS 
BURNED AND MELTED AT THE END, AS WAS THE JUMPER WIRE BETWEEN THE BUS 
BARS. A SHOPOWNER AT THE ARPT STATED THAT THE JUMPER WIRE WAS 
UNDERSIZED AND BECAME OVERLOADED CAUSING THE INSULATION TO BURN. THE 
CABIN HEATER VALVE WAS FOUND POSITIONED TO THE ON POSITION WHICH 
WOULD ALLOW ENGINE HEAT TO ENTER THE COCKPIT NEAR THE FLOOR LEVEL.
