THE AIRCRAFT NOSED DOWN IN A CROP OF CORN DURING A FORCED LANDING AFTER 
THE ENGINE LOST POWER AT 200 FEET AGL DURING TAKEOFF CLIMB. DURING THE 
TURN BACK TO THE AIRSTRIP THE LEFT WING STALLED. THE PILOT SAID HE 
RECOVERED ABOUT 10 FEET AGL BUT THE CORN STALKS SLOWED THE AIRCRAFEET AND 
FORCED THE NOSE DOWN. AFTER THE ACCIDENT AN INSPECTION SHOWED A FUEL 
LINE CRIMPED AGAINST THE TANK CAUSING A PARTIAL BLOCKING OF FUEL FLOW. 
THIS IS A HOMEBUILT AIRCRAFT.
