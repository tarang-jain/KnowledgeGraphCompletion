THE AIRCRAFT EXPERIENCED THE SEPARATION OF A FLAP VANE WHILE ON FINAL 
APPROACH TO LAND. 50 INCHES OF THE RIGHT FLAP VANE SEPARATED AND CAUSED 
SLIGHT DAMAGE TO A PARKED AUTO ON THE STREET BELOW. THE AIRCRAFT CONTINUED 
ON TO AN UNEVENTLY LANDING. THE INCIDENT WAS NOT NOTICED UNTIL A LOCAL 
RESIDENT CALLED TO REPORT THE FALLEN ARTICLE. ALL DC-10 OPERATORS WERE 
NOTIFIED BY TELEX OF THE FAILURE DUE TO DELAMINATION OF THE VANE FROM 
MOISTURE INGESTION. A SKIN REPAIR HAD BEEN MADE INTHIS CASE AND A COLD 
BOND METHOD WITH INADEQUATE SURFACE PREPARATION AND INSUFFICIENT 
PRESSURE DURING BONDING WERE MAJORFACTORS IN THE FAILURE OF THE BOND. 
THE IDENTITY OF THE FACILITY THAT MADE THE BOND REPAIR TO THE VANE WAS 
NOT DETERMINED.
