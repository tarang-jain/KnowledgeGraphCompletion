THE PILOT LANDED AT PORTALES, NM WITH ABOUT 7 GAL OF JET FUEL REMAINING IN 
THE FUEL TANK. SINCE JET FUEL WAS NOT AVAILABLE, HE ADDED 15 GAL OF 100 
LOW LEAD AVGAS, WHICH WAS AN APPROVED ALTERNATE FUEL. SHORTLY AFTER 
TAKING OFF, THE ENG FLAMED OUT AND THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO OBTAIN A RESTART. 
DURING AN EMERENCY LANDING, THE TAIL BOOM AND MAIN ROTOR BLADES WERE 
DAMAGED. THE PILOT STATED THAT THE START FUEL PUMP WAS IN THE 'ON' 
POSITION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FLIGHT MANUAL AND THAT THE AUTORELIGHT SYS 
WAS ARMED. THE ENG WAS DISASSEMBLED BUT NO CAUSE FOR THE FLAMEOUT WAS 
FOUND.
