THE PILOT REPORTED THAT DURING HIS APPROACH TO LAND, THE GLIDER ENCOUNTERED 
TURBULENCE. HE STATED THAT HE WAS 'UNABLE TO MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL 
CONTROL ON LANDING CONTACT WITH GROUND.' THE GLIDER TOUCHED DOWN IN 
A LEFT YAW. SHORTLY AFTER TOUCHDOWN, HE REGAINED DIRECTIONAL CONTROL 
AND CONTINUED THE LANDING TO A NORMAL STOP. A POST FLIGHT EXAM REVEALED 
DAMAGE TO THE GLIDER'S GEAR BOX. THE PILOT BELIEVED THAT THE TURBULENCE 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH A ROTOR IN THE 3RD STANDING WAVE CYCLE 
OF A MOUNTAIN WAVE.
