EARLIER IN THE DAY, AN ANNUAL INSPECTION HAD BEEN COMPLETED. THERE 
WERE NO REFUELING FACILITIES ON THE ARPT, SO THE PILOT/MECHANIC DROVE TO 
ANOTHER LOCATION AND PURCHASED A CAN OF GASOLINE (6 GALS) WHICH HE ADDED 
TO THE TANKS. HE THEN STARTED THE ENG AND SATISFACTORILY COMPLETED A TEST 
FLIGHT. AT ABOUT 1425 EST, A POTENTIAL BUYER WAS BOARDED AND A DEMONSTRATION 
FLIGHT WAS BEGUN. DURING THE INITIAL CLIMB, AT ABOUT 300 FEET AGL, THE ENG 
BEGAN SPUTTERING. THE PILOT TRIED TO RETURN TO THE RUNWAY, BUT THE ENG LOST 
ALL POWER. DURING A FORCED LANDING, THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH A FENCE. THE 
FUEL SYS WAS CHECKED AND APPEARED TO OPERATE NORMALLY. NOTHING WAS 
FOUND IN THE GASCOLATOR OR FUEL SCREEN TO BLOCK THE FUEL FLOW. THE PILOT 
SUSPECTED THAT ICE MAY HAVE FORMED IN A LOW POINT IN THE FUEL PLUMBING 
THAT COULD NOT BE DRAINED. HOWEVER, THE TEMP ROSE ABOVE FREEZING 
ABOUT 2.4 HRS BEFORE THE FLIGHT. WATER WAS DRAINED FROM A T-FITTING THAT 
ACTED AS A SUMP, BUT COULD ONLY BE DRAINED BY REMOVING A PLUG.
