THE AIRCRAFT RAN INTO A CREEK BED DURING AN OFF ARPT LANDING AND THE 
LANDING GEAR COLLAPSED. THE PILOT WAS CONDUCTING AN AERIAL HUNT OF 
COYOTES. AFTER SHOOTING ONE HE SOUGHT A PLACE TO LAND TO PICK UP THE 
CARCASS AND STATED THAT ALTHOUGH HE INSPECTED THE AREA FROM THE AIR 
HE APPARENTLY DID NOT SEE THE CREEK BED.
