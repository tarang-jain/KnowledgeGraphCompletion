AFTER TAKING OFF AND WHILE CLIMBING THRU ABOUT 100 TO 300 FT, THE ENG LOST 
POWER. DURING A FORCED LANDING, THE AIRCRAFT IMPACTED A FENCE AND A BERM, AND 
WENT OVER RAILROAD TRACKS, THEN CAME TO REST INVERTED IN A DITCH. AN 
EXAM OF THE AIRCRAFT REVEALED CORROSION IN THE FUEL STRAINER. ABOUT 1 1/2 
CUPS OF WATER WAS DRAINED FROM THE RIGHT FUEL TANK LINE AND ABOUT 1/8 CUP 
OF WATER WAS DRAINED FROM THE LEFT FUEL TANK LINE. THIS WAS THE 1ST FLIGHT 
SINCE THE ENG HAD BEEN REBUILT AND INSTALLED.
