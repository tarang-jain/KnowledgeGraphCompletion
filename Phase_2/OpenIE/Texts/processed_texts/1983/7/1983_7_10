THE AIRCRAFT LANDED WHEELS-UP DURING A TRAINING FLIGHT. THE CFI WAS SIMULATING 
A SINGLE-ENGINE LANDING. THE CFI SAID HE AND THESTUDENT WERE ENGROSSED 
IN CONVERSATION AND FORGOT TO LOWER THE LANDING GEAR PRIOR TO 
LANDING. THE WARNING HORN DID NOT SOUND UNTIL JUST BEFORE TOUCHDOWN 
BECAUSE OF THE POWER-ON LANDING (12 INCHES HG SIMULATED ZERO THRUST ON 
THE DEAD ENGINE).
