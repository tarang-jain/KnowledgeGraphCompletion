THE AIRCRAFT STALLED, DRAGGED THE LEFT WING AND COLLIDED WITH A FENCE 
DURING LANDING. A 2ND PILOT WITH LIMITED MULTI-ENGINE EXPERIENCE WAS 
MAKING THE LANDING. WHEN POWER WAS REDUCED ABOUT 10 FEET ABOVE THE 
THRESHOLD, THE AIRCRAFT STALLED. THE LEFT MAIN GEAR AND THE LEFT WING TIP 
MADE GROUND CONTACT. THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND TOOK CONTROL AND TRIED TO 
CORRECT THE SITUATION WITH POWER, BRAKE AND RUDDER. IN SPITE OF HIS 
EFFORTS, THE LEFT WING STRUCK A FENCE POLE AND THE AIRCRAFT ROTATED LEFT 
INTO THE FENCE. DUE TO THE TERRAIN, A LEFT TURN (DOG LEG) WAS REQUIRED ON 
FINAL APPROACH, JUST PRIOR TO LANDING. THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND STATED THAT 
HE DID NOT SEE THE GRASS RUNWAY UNTIL THE OTHER PILOT MADE A TURN TO 
LAND.
