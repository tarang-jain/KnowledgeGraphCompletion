WITNESSES REPORTED THAT AFTER TAKEOFF, THE PILOT FLEW BY A CABIN AT 
APPROXIMATELY 200 FT, SIGNALED BY ROCKING THE AIRCRAFT'S WINGS, THEN BEGAN A 
GRADUAL CLIMB. THE CLIMB INCREASED IN STEEPNESS UNTIL 1 WITNESS COULD 
SEE THE ENTIRE TOP OF THE AIRCRAFT. IT THEN NOSED OVER, MADE 1 1/2 TO 2 1/2 
TURNS AND CRASHED. AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED NO SPECIFIC PREIMPACT 
MALFUNCTION OR FAILURE. HOWEVER, AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT AIRCRAFT 
HAD RECEIVED 3 MAJOR MODIFICATIONS, 2 OF WHICH WERE UNDER 
SUPPLEMENTAL TYPE CERTIFICATES (STC'S).  A MODIFIED ELEVATOR BELLCRANK 
HAD BEEN INSTALLED, BUT THERE WAS NO FLOOR OR PROTECTIVE COVERING 
INSTALLED OVER THE BELLCRANK. ONLY A CANVAS BARRIER PROTECTED THE 
BELLCRANK FROM ITEMS PLACED IN THE BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT. THE EDGES OF 
THE CANVAS DID NOT EXTEND TO THE SIDES, TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE FUSELAGE, 
BUT INSTEAD, THERE WAS A 2 TO 3 INCH CAP, LACED WITHE STRING TO HOLD THE 
CANVAS SECURE. A WHISK BROOM WAS FOUND IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE 
ELEVATOR BELLCRANK.
