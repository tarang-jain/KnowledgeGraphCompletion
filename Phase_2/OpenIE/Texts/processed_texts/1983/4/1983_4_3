THE AIRCRAFT WAS ON A FLIGHT TO A PRIVATE RANCH LANDING STRIP AT NIGHT. THE STRIP 
HAD AN UNLIGHTED WINDSOCK AT MIDFIELD AND PORTABLE RUNWAY EDGE LIGHTS 
WERE IN USE. DURING ARRIVAL, THE AIRCREW ESTIMATED THE VISIBILITY WAS 3 
TO 4 MI AND REPORTED THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO LAND. PERSONNEL AT THE RANCH 
HEARD THE AIRCRAFT FLY OVER. ONE OF THEM REPORTED THAT EARLIER, THE WIND 
HAD BEEN BLOWING HARD AND THE AIR WAS FULL OF DUST, BUT AT THE TIME THE 
AIRCRAFT ARRIVED, DUST HAD SETTLED. A DEPUTY SHERIFF NOTED THAT AT TIMES, THE 
VISIBILITY WAS GOOD, BUT AT OTHER TIMES, IT WAS POOR. THE AIRCRAFT OWNER, WHO 
WAS AT THE RANCH, SAID HE COULD SEE THE AIRCRAFT LIGHTS AT TIMES (IN THE 
TRAFFIC PATTERN), BUT AT TIMES, HE COULD NOT SEE THEM. AFTER MAKING 2 
PASSES, THE AIRCRAFT CRASHED IN THE AREA WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON A BASE 
LEG. AN EXAM OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED IT WAS IN A LEFT TURN DURING 
IMPACT. AFTER INITIAL IMPACT, IT BOUNCED/SLID 663 FT, THEN HIT A TREE 
COVERED CANAL LEVEE AND BURNED. NO EVIDENCE OF A PREIMPACT/MECHANICAL 
MALFUNCTION OR FAILURE WAS FOUND.
