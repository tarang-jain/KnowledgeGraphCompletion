THE THROTTLE FULL BACK TO DESCEND, THEN THE ENG STOPPED. HE STATED THAT 
HE TRIED TO START THE ENG, BUT WAS UNABLE, SO HE LANDED STRAIGHT AHEAD 
IN TREES. THE AIRCRAFT WAS DESTROYED DURING IMPACT WITH THE TREES. 
WITNESSES REPORTED THAT BOTH OCCUPANTS OF THE AIRCRAFT APPEARED TO BE 
INTOXICATED, WERE DRINKING WHILE THE AIRCRAFT WAS BEING REFUELED, AND HAD 
MADE A 100 DOLLAR WAGER THAT THE PILOT COULD GLIDE THE AIRCRAFT FROM PIONEER 
PEAK TO FINGER LAKE WITH THE ENG SHUT OFF. ONE WITNESS OBSERVED THE 
AIRCRAFT WITH BINOCULARS AND SAW THAT THE ENG WAS STOPPED. ACCORDING TO HIM, 
THE ENG HAD NOT BEEN STARTED BY THE TIME THE AIRCRAFT WENT OUT OF SIGHT 
BEHIND TREES. MEDICAL PERSONNEL REPORTED THAT AT THE CRASH SITE, THE 
PILOT APPEARED INTOXICATED, HOSTILE AND UNCOOPERATIVE. A BLOOD SAMPLE 
TAKEN ABOUT 2 1/2 HRS AFTER THE ACCIDENT WAS FOUND TO HAVE AN ALCOHOL 
LEVEL OF 0.204.
