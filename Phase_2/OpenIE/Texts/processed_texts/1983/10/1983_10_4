THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH TREES DURING LANDING ROLL. THE PILOT HAS 
RECOUNTED SEVERAL VARIATIONS OF THE ACCIDENT FROM LOCKED BRAKES 
(PARKING) TO A FLAT LEFT TIRE WITH FULL RIGHT RUDDER TO MAINTAIN 
DIRECTIONAL CONTROL. THERE WAS A LEFT TIRE SKID MARK FROM TOUCHDOWN 
ACCORDING TO THE PILOT. THE RIGHT TIRE LEFEET A SKID MARK ALSO ABOUT 100 FEET 
LATER. ACCORDING TO THE INSURANCE ADJUSTERS ACCOUNT THE PILOT SAID HE DID 
NOT USE THE BRAKES DURING LANDING. ANOTHER WITNESS SAYS BOTH TIRES LEFT 
SKID MARKS STARTING 800 FEET FROM THE RUNWAY THRESHOLD.
