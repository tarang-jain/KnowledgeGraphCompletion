THE INSTRUCTOR PILOT (CFI) KNEW THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS GETTING LOW ON FUEL, BUT 
HE WANTED THE STUDENT TO MAKE ONE MORE TAKEOFF AND LANDING. WHEN THE 
AIRCRAFEET WAS CLIMBING THRU ABOUT 200 FEET AFEETER TAKEOFF, THE ENG BEGAN LOSING 
POWER. THE CFI ASSUMED CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT AND SWITCHED THE FUEL 
SELECTOR TO THE LEFT TANK WHICH INDICATED 1/4 FULL. HOWEVER, THE ENG 
WOULD NOT RESTART. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE AIRCRAFT WAS DAMAGED DURING A 
LANDING ON ROUGH TERRAIN.
