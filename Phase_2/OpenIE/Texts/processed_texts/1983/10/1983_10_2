THE HELICOPTER WAS BEING USED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF ELECT 
TRANSMISSION LINES. A 150-FT LONGLINE CABLE HAD BEEN UTILIZEDON AN 
EARLIER FLIGHT FOR LIFTING EXTERNAL LOADS. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO 
REASON FOR THE LONGLINE TO BE ATTACHED ON THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT AS THE 
PAX WERE BEING TRANSPORTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR CONSTRUCTION AND 
INSPECTION DUTIES. THE HELICOPTER TOOK OFF WITH THE LONGLINE ATTACHED 
AND NO EXTERNAL LOAD. AFTER TAKEOFF, THE HELICOPTER MOVED FORWARD ABOUT 
200 FEET TO A TREELINE AND BEGAN A LEFEET TURN, AWAY FROM TOWER 51 WHERE THE 
TAKEOFF WAS INITIATED, TOWARD A POINT WHERE ONE OF THE PAX WAS TO BE 
DISCHARGED. AS THE HELICOPTER FLEW OVER THE TREES THE LONGLINE BECAME 
ENTANGLED IN THE TREES.
