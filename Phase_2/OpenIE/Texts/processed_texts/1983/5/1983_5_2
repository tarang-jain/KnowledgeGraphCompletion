THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH THE GROUND DURING A SIMULATED FORCED LANDING 
AND GO-AROUND. THE AIRCRAFT'S LEFT MAIN LANDING GEAR WASSHEARED AND THE 
LEFT WING DRAGGED DURING GROUND CONTACT. THE CFI HAD GIVEN THE 
STUDENT A SIMULATED FORCED LANDING DURING THE APPROACH AND SINCE THE 
STUDENT WAS NOT MAKING THE INTENDED LANDING AREA A GO-AROUND WAS 
INITIATED. AS THE AIRCRAFEET WAS CLIMBING THROUGH 1100 FEET POWER WAS AGAIN CUT 
OFF FOR A LANDING. THE STUDENT DID NOT REACT PROMPTLY AND AIRCRAFT ENTERED 
AN EXCESSIVE RATE OF DESCENT WHICH WAS NOT CORRECTED BEFORE CONTACT 
EVEN THOUGH THE CFI HAD ORDERED A 2ND GO-AROUND.
