THE AIRCRAFT CRASHED SHORTLY AFTER DECLARING AN 'EMERGENCY.' A WITNESS SAW 
THE AIRCRAFT, BUT HEARD NO ENG SOUND PRIOR TO THE CRASH. EXAMINATION OF ENG 
FAILED TO REVEAL ANY DISCREPANCIES. HOWEVER, WHEN THE CARBURETOR WAS 
EXAMINED NO FUEL WAS FOUND IN THE LINE BETWEEN THE ENG DRIVEN FUEL 
PUMP AND THE CARB. THE CARB WAS EMPTY OF USEABLE FUEL.
