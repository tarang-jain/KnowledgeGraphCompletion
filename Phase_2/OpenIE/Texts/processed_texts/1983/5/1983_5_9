AROUND. THE RUNWAY IN USE WAS 17 AND THE WIND WAS FROM 250 DEGREES AT 
15 KTS GUSTING TO 24 KTS. THE PILOT STATED HE COULD NOT GET ALIGNED WITH 
THE RUNWAY SO HE RETRACTED THE LANDING GEAR AND STARTED A GO-AROUND. 
THE AIRCRAFT WOULD NOT CLIMB OUT OF GROUND EFFECT AND SETTLED BACK TO THE 
GROUND 100 FEET OFF THE SIDE OF THE RUNWAY. AFTER SKIDDING 100 TO 150 FEET 
THE WIND LIFTED THE WING AND THE AIRCRAFT WENT OVER ON ITS BACK
