DURING A WX BRIEFING, THE NON-INSTRUMENT RATED PILOT WAS TOLD TO EXPECT 
NO SIGNIFICANT EN ROUTE WX, BUT WAS ADVISED OF LOWER CEILINGS ALONG THE 
COASTLINE, LATER THAT NIGHT. THERE WERE NO RECORDS OF EN ROUTE WX 
BRIEFINGS. WHEN THE AIRCRAFT WAS ABOUT 40 MI NORTHWEST OF THE DESTINATION, 
THE PILOT CONTACTED CORPUS CHRISTI APPROACH CONTROL AND WAS ADVISED OF IFR WX 
IN THE VICINITY. HE REQUESTED AND WAS PROVIDED RADAR VECTORS TO HIS 
DESTINATION, BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN FINDING THE ARPT. THE PILOT THEN 
REPORTED THAT HE WAS 'UNABLE TO GET DOWN' AND REQUESTED VECTORS TO 
CORPUS CHRISTI. HE WAS AGAIN ADVISED OF IFR CONDITIONS AT CORPUS CHRISTI. 
WHEN ASKED IF HE COULD FLY AN IFR APCH, HE GAVE A NEGATIVE REPLY. HE ALSO 
REPORTED THAT HE WAS IN IFR CONDITIONS AND HAD INSUFFICIENT FUEL TO FLY TO 
SAN ANTONIO. SUBSEQUENTLY, RADAR CONTACT WAS LOST APPROXIMATELY 2 MI SOUTHEAST 
OF THE ARPT. LATER, BOTH OCCUPANTS AND AIRCRAFT DEBRIS WERE FOUND WHERE THE 
HAD WASHED ON OR NEAR THE SHORE FORM THE GULF OF MEXICO.
