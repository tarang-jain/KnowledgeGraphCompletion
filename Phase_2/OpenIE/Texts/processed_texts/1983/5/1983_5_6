PRIOR TO TAKEOFF, THE AIRCRAFT WAS FULLY FUELED WITH 100 GAL OF AVIATION 
GASOLINE AND WAS LOADED WITH 300 GAL OF NON-TOXIC FUNGICIDAL MIX. THE PILOT 
TOOK OFF, FLEW APPROXIMATELY 5 MI TO A FIELD, AND AFTER CIRCLING OVER THE FIELD, 
MADE 2 SWATH RUNS. DURING A PROCEDURE TURN AFTER THE 2ND SWATH RUN, 
THE ENGINE LOST POWER. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE AIRCRAFT CRASHED IN A STEEP, NOSE 
DOWN ATTITUDE. AN INVESTIGAITON REVEALED THAT A PORTION OF THE #5 
CYLINDER WAS MISSING AND WAS NOT WITH THE MAIN WRECKAGE. A VISUAL EXAM 
OF THE FRACTURE SURFACE INDICATED EVIDENCE OF FATIGUE.
