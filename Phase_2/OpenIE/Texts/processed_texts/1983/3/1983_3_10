WHILE ON A SOLO CROSS-COUNTRY, THE STUDENT PILOT BECAME DISORIENTED ON 
THE 3RD LEG OF THE FLIGHT. HE REORIENTED HIMSELF, BUT THE ENG LOST POWER 
BEFORE HE REACHED HIS INTENDED DESTINATION. DURING AN EMERGENCY 
LANDING, THE AIRCRAFT ENCOUNTERED SOFT TERRAIN AND WAS DAMAGED WHEN IT 
ROLLED ACROSS A 3 FEET DEEP DITCH. APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 6 GAL OF FUEL WAS FOUND IN THE 
LEFT TANK AND ONLY ABOUT 1 GAL WAS REMAINING IN THE RIGHT TANK. UNUSABLE 
FUEL WAS 1 GAL PER TANK. THE STUDENT SAID THAT WHEN THE ENG LOST POWER, 
HE MOVED THE FUEL SELECTOR TO THE LEFT TANK, THEN SWITCHED TO THE 
RIGHT TANK AND BACK TO THE LEFT TANK AGAIN WHILE HE WAS TRYING TO RESTART 
THE ENG.
