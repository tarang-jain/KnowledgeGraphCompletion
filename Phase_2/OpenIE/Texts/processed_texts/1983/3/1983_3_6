THE PASSENGER WAS IN THE BACK SEAT WITH A 35 MM CAMERA, A POCKET 
CAMERA, A PAIR OF BINOCULARS IN A CASE AND A WINDBREAKER. WHILE FLYING 
AT DUSK, THEY FLEW BY A HERD OF DEER, BUT THE PASSENGER DID NOT GET A 
PHOTOGRAPH. REPORTEDLY, THE PILOT MADE A 180 DEG TURN AND MADE A 2ND PASS 
TOWARD RISING TERRAIN. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE WAS SLIGHTLY BELOW A 
CREST WHEN HE APPLIED BACK PRESSURE ON THE CONTROL STICK BUT THE STICK 
WOULD NOT MOVE AFT. HE BELIEVED THAT ONE OF THE PASSENGER'S CAMERAS 
BECAME WEDGED BETWEEN THE REAR SEAT AND THE REAR CONTROL STICK. HE 
FURTHER STATED THAT THE TOP OF ONE OF THE CAMERAS WAS DAMAGED. THE 
PASSENGER STATED THAT THE POCKET CAMERA 'MUST HAVE FALLEN OUT OF MY 
POCKET IN THE CRASH.' ACCORDING TO HIM, HE HEARD SCRAPING NOISES, WHICH 
HE BELIEVED WERE TREES HITTING THE AIRCRAFT; THEN SAW THE STICK COME BACK 
BEFORE THE NOISES BECAME LOUDER AND HARDER. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE AIRCRAFT 
CRASHED BEYOND THE CREST. REPORTEDLY, THE PILOT WAS UNCONSCIOUS AND 
BLOCKED THE DOOR FOR A SHORT TIME AFTER THE AIRCRAFT CAME TO REST.
