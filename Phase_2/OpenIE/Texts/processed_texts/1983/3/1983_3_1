THE AIRCRAFT CRASHED INTO AN OPEN FIELD LEAVING NO GROUND SCARS OTHER 
THAN THE PRINCIPAL IMPACT. ONE WITNESS SAW THE AIRCRAFT STALL AT THE TOP OF A 
LOOP AND GO INTO A SPIN (TAIL-DOWN). HE STATED THE AIRCRAFT ROTATED 6-8 TIMES 
PRIOR TO IMPACT WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING. THE AIRCRAFT OWNER STATED THAT 'IF 
THE PLANE GOES INTO A VERY FLAT SPIN INVERTED, THE ONLY WAY OUT IS TOCUT 
THE POWER.'
