THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH A TELEPHONE POLE WHILE ATTEMPTING A 
TAKEOFF ON SKIS. THE SNOW WAS WET, SPARSE AND STICKY AND THE TAKEOFF 
WAS BEING PERFORMED ON A TAXIWAY BECAUSE IT HAD MORE SNOW. THIS WAS A 
DUAL INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT WITH THE STUDENT AT THE CONTROLS. THE 
STUDENT ROTATED PREMATURELY, STALLED AND SETTLED BACK ON THE SNOW. 
THE TAKEOFF WAS CONTINUED AND AFTER A 2ND LIFT OFF THE AIRCRAFT AGAIN 
ENTERED A STALL. THE CFI TOOK OVER AND IN LOWERING THE NOSE TO GAIN 
AIRSPEED AND TURNING TO AVOID TREES THE WING HIT A TELEPHONE POLE. THE 
AIRCRAFT THEN CARTWHEELED AND WAS DAMAGED BEYOND ECONOMICAL 
REPAIR.
