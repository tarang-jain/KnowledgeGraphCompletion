DURING AN APPROACH TO AN OIL DRILLING RIG PLATFORM, THE ENGINE 
DECELERATED AS THE PILOT STARTED TO ALL POWER. WITH THE AIRCRAFT BELOW THE 
LANDING AREA, HE MANEUVERED TO MISS THE PLATFORM AND INITIATED AN 
AUTOROTATIVE LANDING. HE MADE A MAYDAY CALL AND TRIED TO ELECTRICALLY 
DEPLOY THE EMERGENCY FLOATS; HOWEVER, THE RIGHT FLOAT FAILED TO 
INFLATE AND THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT TIME FOR MANUAL DEPLOYMENT. 
IMMEDIATELY ON TOUCHDOWN, THE HELICOPTER ROLLED OVER AND BEGAN TO FILL 
WITH WATER. REPORTEDLY, THERE WAS ONLY MINOR DAMAGE FROM WATER 
IMMERSION. NO PREIMPACT DISCREPANCIES WERE FOUND THAT WOULD HAVE 
CAUSED THE POWER LOSS. THE WIRES TO THE RIGHT FLOAT (FOR ELECTRICAL 
DEPLOYMENT) WERE WORN IN TWO AT A CENTER HEX HEAD SCREW. A FLEET 
INSPECTION OF 37 AIRCRAFT REVEALED THAT 60% WERE WORN THRU IN THE SAME 
AREA.
