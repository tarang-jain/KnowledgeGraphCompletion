THE PILOT REPORTED THAT A NEIGHBOR HAD FLOWN THE AIRCRAFT EARLIER IN THE DAY 
AND HAD PROBLEMS ADJUSTING THE ELEVATOR TRIM WHEN AIRBORNE. THE PILOT 
STATED THAT BEFORE TAKEOFF, HE CHECKED THE TRIM, BUT IT WORKED 
NORMALLY, SO HE SET IT FOR CRUISE AND MADE A NORMAL TAKEOFF. WHILE 
TURNING TO A X-WIND LEG, HE TRIED TO ADJUST THE ELEVATOR TRIM, BUT IT 
WOULD NOT OPERATE. THE PILOT THEN TRIED TO RELIEVE THE AIRLOAD ON THE 
STABILIZOR BY PULLING BACK ON THE STICK TO GO INTO A CLIMB, THEN 
RELEASING THE BACK PRESSURE TO PUT THE AIRCRAFT IN A NEAR ZERO 'G' CONDITION. 
HE WAS STILL UNABLE TO MOVE THE TRIM. THE PILOT PULLED UP AGAIN, BUT A 
LITTLE HARDER. HOWEVER, THIS TIME THE AIRCRAFT STALLED AND WENT INTO A SPIN. 
THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO RECOVER BEFORE THE AIRCRAFT HIT THE GROUND. AN 
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE ELEVATOR TRIM WAS IN A SLIGHT NOSE 
DOWN POSITION, BUT NO PREIMPACT/MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION WAS DETECTED.
