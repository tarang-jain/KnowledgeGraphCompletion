ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, THE WIND WAS NORTHWESTERLY AT ABOUT 20 KTS AND 
THE RUNWAY HEADING OF THE DIRT STRIP WAS 030 DEG. THE PILOT MADE A LOW PASS 
OVER THE STRIP, THEN MADE A TOUCH-AND-GO LANDING. ON THE 3RD APCH, THE 
AIRCRAFEET TOUCHED DOWN ABOUT 800 TO 900 FEET FROM THE APPROACH END, THEN IT ROLLED 
APPROXIMATELY 900 TO 1000 FT. THE AIRCRAFT THEN LIFTED OFF IN A STEEP CLIMB AND ENTERED A 
STEEP RIGHT BANK, FROM WHICH, THE NOSE DROPPED AND THE PLANE DIVED 
ALMOST VERTICALLY TO THE GROUND. NO PREIMPACT PART FAILURE OR 
MALFUNCTION WAS FOUND.
