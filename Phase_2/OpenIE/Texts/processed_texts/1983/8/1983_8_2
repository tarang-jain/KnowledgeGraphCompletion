THE AIRCRAFT NOSED OVER AFTER A SOLO STUDENT PILOT LOST DIRECTIONAL 
CONTROL DURING LANDING. THE WIND WAS FROM THE SOUTH AT 5 TO 10 KTS. 
BECAUSE OF THE WIND AND TURBULENCE THE CFI HAD FLOWN ONE PATTERN 
WITH HIM. THE STUDENT MADE THE LANDING WITHOUT ASSISTANCE. THE CFI GOT 
OUT AND THE STUDENT MADE A SUCCESSFUL SOLO LANDING. ON THE 2ND 
APPROACH HE WAS TOO HIGH AND WENT AROUND. ON THE 3RD APPROACH HE WAS 
HIGH AGAIN AND UNSTEADY IN THE WIND. THE AIRCRAFT BOUNCED ON TOUCHDOWN 
AND THE STUDENT APPLIED THE BRAKES THROUGHOUT A SERIES OF BOUNCES 
FOLLOWED BY THE AIRCRAFT NOSING OVER OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY.THE 
STUDENT HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO MAKE FULL STOP LANDINGS USING 20 
DEGREES OF FLAPS AND 60 KTS OF AIRSPEED ON FINAL APPROACH.
