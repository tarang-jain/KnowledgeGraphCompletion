WHILE ON AN OVER WATER FLIGHT, BOTH ENGS LOST POWER AND THE PILOT DITCHED THE 
AIRCRAFT AT SEA. BEFORE DITCHING, THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS OUT OF 
FUEL, THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL CONTROLLER CONTACTED A US COAST GUARD HELICOPTER THAT 
WAS ON HIS FREQUENCY AND REQUESTED ASSISTANCE. THE HELICOPTER WAS FLOWN 
TO THE DITCHING AREA AND THE DOWNED PERSONNEL WERE RESCUED.
