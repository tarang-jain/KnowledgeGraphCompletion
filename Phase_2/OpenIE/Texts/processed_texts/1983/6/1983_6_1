WHILE CLIMBING IN IFR CONDITIONS AFTER TAKEOFF, THE #1 ENG LOST POWER. 
THE PILOT DUMPED FUEL AND LANDED ON AN OIL EXPLORATION PLATFORM. WHILE 
DUMPING FUEL, THE #1 JETTISON SYS OPERATED NORMALLY, BUT THE CIRUIT 
BREAKER POPPED ON THE #2 SYS. THE AIRCREW RESET THE CIRCUIT BREAKER AND 
WERE ABLE TO OPEN THE VALVE, BUT THE CIRCUIT BREAKER POPPED AGAIN. THEY 
WERE ABLE TO CLOSE THE #2 JETTISON VALVE BY HOLDING THE CIRCUIT BREAKER 
IN. AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE LOWER ACCESSORY LEVEL GEAR, PN 2-
070-024-01, IN THE #1 ENG, HAD FAILED.
