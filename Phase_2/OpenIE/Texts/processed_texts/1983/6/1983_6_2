THE AIRCRAFT HAD BEEN AIRBORNE FOR OVER 1 HR AND WAS DESCENDING ONTO BASE LEG 
WHEN THE ENG QUIT RUNNING AS THE PILOT WENT TO ADD POWER. A FORCED 
LANDING WAS MADE IN A GRASSY AREA NEAR THE RUNWAY. AFTER THE AIRCRAFT TOUCHED 
DOWN, IT HIT A DITCH DURING THE ROLL-OUT, THEN NOSED OVER. AN EXAM OF 
THE MAGNETO REVEALED THAT THE POINTS WERE PITTED, CORRODED AND WORN AND 
THE MAGNETO WAS INOPERATIVE. IT WAS PURCHASED 2ND HAND AND HAD AN 
ESTIMATED 400 HRS OF OPERATION. THE ENG WAS EQUIPPED WITH ONLY 1 
MAGNETO.
