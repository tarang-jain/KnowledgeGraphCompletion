A NAVIGABLE WATERWAY, HARVEY CANAL, WAS BEING USED AS A SEAPLANE BASE. 
IN THAT AREA, A SET OF POWER LINES WERE SUSPENDED OVER THE CANAL BY 2 
TALL TOWERS. THE LOWEST LINE OVER THE CANAL WAS 160 FEET ABOVE THE CANAL 
SURFACE, BUT THE LINES DROPPED TO HEIGHTS OF DOWN TO 60 FEET OVER LAND. 
THE NORMAL PROCEDURE FOR A SOUTH TAKEOFF WAS TO FLY UNDER THE 
LINESAFTER LIFT-OFF OR TO TURN AND CROSS OVER THE LINES WHERE THEY ARE 
LOW TO THE GROUND. WHILE TAKING OFF, THE AIRCRAFT WAS OBSERVED TO CLIMB 
NORMALLY TO APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET AGL, THEN BEGAN TO ACCELERATE. APPROXIMATELY 500 FEET NORTH 
OF THE POWER LINES, THE AIRCRAFT ENTERED AN ABRUPT CLIMB AND REPORTEDLY WENT 
TO A NEAR VERTICAL ATTITUDE. IT THEN ROTATED ABOUT THE LEFT WING AND 
DESCENDED VERTICALLY INTO THE CANAL, IMPACTING APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET NORTH OF THE 
POWER LINES. AN EXAM REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF A PREIMPACT MALFUNCTION 
OR FAILURE. AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE PILOT HAD BEEN GIVING FLIGHT 
INSTRUCTION TO THE PASSENGER. IT WAS NOT VERIFIED WHO HAD PULLED THE 
AIRCRAFT UP, BUT THE PILOT'S NORMAL PROCEDURE WAS TO FLY UNDER THE WIRES.
