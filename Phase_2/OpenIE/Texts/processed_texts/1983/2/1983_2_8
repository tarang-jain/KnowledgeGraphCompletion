SHORTLY AFTER LIFT-OFF, THE AIRCRAFT STARTED ITS INITIAL CLIMB, THEN ENTERED A 
SLOW DESCENT. THE FLIGHT WAS CONTINUED UNTIL THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH A 
TV CABLE, SUSPENDED BELOW TELEPHONE CABLES ON THE SAME POLES. THE AIRCRAFT 
CONTACTED THE GROUND, BOUNCED AND BECAME AIRBORNE 2 TIMES, THEN 
CONTINUED ON THE GROUND. THE PLANE CROSSED A ROAD, HIT A ROAD SIGN, RAN 
THROUGH A FENCE, HIT A DETACHED GARAGE, THEN FLIPPED INVERTED AND 
STOPPED. THE PILOT STATED THAT THE REAR ENGINE LOST EITHER PARTIAL OR ALL 
POWER. A MECHANIC REPORTED SEEING THE AIRCRAFT TAXI WITH THE AFT ENGINE 
NOT OPERATING. REPORTEDLY, HE WAS UNABLE TO STOP THE PILOT TO TELL HIM. NO 
ROTATIONAL DAMAGE WAS NOTED ON THE AFT PROPELLER. DURING AN 
OPERATIONAL EXAM OF THE POWER PLANTS, THE AFT ENGINE CHECKED NORMAL, 
BUT THE FRONT ENGINE WOULD DEVELOP ONLY APPROXIMATELY 200 HP INSTEAD OF THE 225 
RATED TAKEOFF HP DUE TO A FAULTY ENGINE TURBO CONTROLLER. THE PILOT TOLD 
A POLICE OFFICER THAT HE HAD A COUPLE OF DRINKS AND WAS ARRESTED FOR 
INTOXICATION WHEN HE REFUSED A BREATHALIZER TEST.
