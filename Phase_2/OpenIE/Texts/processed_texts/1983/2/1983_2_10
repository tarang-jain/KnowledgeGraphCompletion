THE GYROCOPTER CRASHED DURING TAKEOFF AFTER CLIMBING TO ABOUT 50 FT. 
AGL. THIS WAS THE SEVENTH TAKEOFF OF THE DAY FOR THIS FLIGHT. THE PILOT LOST 
CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT AND IT DOVE VERTICALLY TO THE GROUND. INVESTIGATION 
OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED THAT THE CYCLIC STICK HAD BECOME 
DISCONNECTED UNDER THE PILOT'S SEAT. THIS SEPARATION OF THE STICK WAS 
NOT THE RESULT OF IMPACT. THE PILOT DID NOT POSSESS AN AIRMAN CERTIFICATE 
AND THERE WAS NO RECORD TO SUBSTANTIATE THAT HE HAD ANY TRAINING IN 
THE GYROCOPTER. THE PILOT NEVER APPLIED FOR A SPECIAL AIRWORTHINESS 
CERTIFICATE.
