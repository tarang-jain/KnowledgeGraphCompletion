THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH A TREE DURING AERIAL APPLICATION OPERATIONS. 
THE PILOT STATED THAT THERE WAS A POWERLINE AT ONE END OF THE ORCHARD 
HE WAS SPRAYING AND A ROW OF LEAFLESS TREES AT THE OTHER. ONE OF THE 
TALLER BOUNDARY TREES WAS OVERLOOKED BY THE PILOT AND THE AIRCRAFT HIT IT. 
THE COLLISION PUNCHED A HOLE IN THE OIL COOLER AND FORCED THE PILOT TO 
MAKE AN OFF AIRPORT LANDING.
