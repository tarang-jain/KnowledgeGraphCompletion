THE AIRPLANE WAS ON A NIGHT CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT WHEN ENGINE OIL 
STARTED TO APPEAR ON THE WINDOWS. THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO GET THE 
AIRPLANE TO AN AIRPORT BEFORE THE OIL PRESSURE WENT TO ZERO. AFTER LOSS 
OF OIL PRESSURE, THE ENGINE STARTED TO VIBRATE, AND THE PROPELLER 
SEPARATED FROM THE ENGINE. WITH NO FORWARD VISIBILITY AND VERY LITTLE 
SIDE VISIBILITY, THE PILOT MADE A FORCED LANDING ON A HIGHWAY SERVICE 
ROAD; HOWEVER, DURING THE LANDING ROLL, THE AIRPLANE IMPACTED 
HIGHWAY SIGNS AND REFLECTORS. THE PILOT SAID THERE WAS A FIRE ON THE 
HIGHWAY, BEHIND THE AIRPLANE, BUT IT NEVER REACHED THE AIRPLANE. A 
TEARDOWN OF THE ENGINE REVEALED A FAILURE OF THE CRANKSHAFT THAT WAS 
INITIATED BY A PRE-EXISTING FATIGUE CRACK. THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT 
OPENING OF THE FATIGUE CRACK LED TO GRADUAL LOSS OF LUBRICATING OIL, 
THEN SEPARATION OF THE PROPELLER.
