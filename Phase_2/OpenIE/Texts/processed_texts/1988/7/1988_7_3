THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE ENGINE LOST POWER ABOUT 20 MILES FROM THE ARPT 
WHERE HE HAD INTENDED TO REFUEL. THE AIRPLANE SUBSEQUENTLY COLLIDED 
WITH UTILITY WIRES AS HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO LAND ON A HWY. THE PILOT 
ATTRIBUTED THE POWER LOSS TO FUEL EXHAUSTION. POSTCRASH EXAM OF THE 
AIRPLANE BY A MECH REVEALED ONLY TRACE AMOUNTS OF FUEL REMAINING ON 
BOARD. THE PILOT NOTED THAT HE HAD TOPPED OFF THE FUEL TANKS PRIOR TO 
DEPARTURE; THIS SHOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM 5.5 TO 6 HRS OF ENDURANCE, BASED 
ON PREVIOUS FLIGHTS IN THE AIRPLANE. THE ACTUAL ENDURANCE WAS ABOUT 4.8 
HRS. EXAM OF THE AIRPLANE POH REVEALED THAT THE AIRPLANE HAD AN 
EXPECTED ENDURANCE OF ABOUT 4.7 HRS AT 75% POWER AND 5.4 HRS AT 65% POWER, 
WITH A 45 MIN RESERVE AT 45% PWR, UNDER THE FLIGHT CONDITIONS REPORTED BY 
THE PILOT. THE POH NOTES HOWEVER, THAT THERE ARE INDETERMINATE 
VARIABLES WHICH CAN ACCOUNT FOR VARIATIONS OF 10% OR MORE IN AIRPLANE 
RANGE AND ENDURANCE. SEVERAL ARPTS WITH FUEL WERE AVAILABLE ALONG THE 
ROUTE OF FLIGHT.
