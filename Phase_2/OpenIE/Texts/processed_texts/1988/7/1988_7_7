THE PILOT STATED THAT THE AIRCRAFT HAD AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM 
APPROXIMATELY 20 MILES FROM GUNNISON. HE CONTINUED HIS FLIGHT AND 
ENTERED THE TRAFFIC PATTERN AT GUNNISON AIRPORT. HE SAID THAT AS HE 
TURNED TO BASE LEG, THE ENGINE QUIT. THERE REMAINED INSUFFICIENT 
ALTITUDE TO REACH THE RUNWAY. SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION AND TESTING OF 
THE ENGINE-DRIVEN FUEL PUMP/CONTROLLER REVEALED A LARGE FUEL LEAK 
AROUND THE MIXTURE CONTROL SHAFT LIMITING THE AMOUNT AND PRESSURE OF 
FUEL THAT COULD REACH THE ENGINE.
