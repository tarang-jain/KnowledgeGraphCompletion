THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE ENGINE BEGAN TO RUN ROUGH AND LOSE POWER AS 
THE AIRPLANE CLIMBED THROUGH 9,000 FEET MSL. SHE THEN SWITCHED FUEL 
TANKS AND MOVED THE MIXTURE TO FULL RICH, BUT THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO 
LOSE POWER. CARB HEAT WAS NOT USED AT ANY TIME. A FORCED LDG WAS 
SUBSEQUENTLY MADE IN A FIELD WHERE THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH A UTILITY 
POLE AND A DITCH. POST-CRASH EXAM OF THE ENGINE REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF 
PREEXISTING MECHANICAL FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION. EXAMINATION OF AN 
ICING PROBABILITY CHART REVEALED THAT THE REPORTED WX CONDITIONS IN 
THE AREA WERE FAVORABLE FOR THE FORMATION OF MODERATE CARBURETOR 
ICING AT CRUISE POWER. THE CESSNA 172M OWNER'S MANUAL NOTES THAT A 
GRADUAL LOSS IN RPM AND EVENTUAL ENGINE ROUGHNESS MAY RESULT FROM 
THE FORMATION OF CARB ICE, AND PRESCRIBES THE USE OF CARB HEAT TO CLEAR 
THE ICE.
