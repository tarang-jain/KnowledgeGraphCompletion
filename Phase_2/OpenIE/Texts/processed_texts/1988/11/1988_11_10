THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE WAS FERRYING THE AIRPLANE TO OBTAIN 
SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE. UPON ARRIVAL OVER THE ARPT, HE FOUND THAT THE 
ONLY RUNWAY WAS CLOSED FOR MAINTENANCE. HE THEN ELECTED TO LAND ON A 
TAXIWAY. HE MADE A SHORT-FIELD LDG AND APPLIED THE BRAKES 'FIRMLY' AFTER 
TOUCHDOWN. BOTH TIRES BLEW OUT DURING THE LDG ROLL, AND HE LOST 
CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED W/ A PARKED TRUCK AND A FENCE. 
EXAM OF THE AIRCRAFT TIRES REVEALED THAT THEY HAD BLOWN OUT AS A RESULT OF 
EXCESSIVE BRAKING. THE DISTANCE FROM THE TAXIWAY ENTRANCE AT THE RUNWAY 
EDGE TO THE TRUCK WAS APPROXIMATELY 500 FT. SEVERAL HANGARS AND OTHER 
OBSTACLES WERE LOCATED OFF THE END OF THE TAXIWAY ALONG THE AIRCRAFT'S 
INITIAL DIRECTION OF TRAVEL. EXAM OF A CESSNA 172N INFO MANUAL REVEALED 
THAT ABOUT 500 FEET WAS REQUIRED FOR THE LDG ROLL GIVEN THE CONDITIONS 
REPORTED BY THE PILOT. A NOTAM (D) WHICH ADVISED OF THE CLOSED RUNWAY WAS 
ISSUED 2 DAYS EARLIER, AND WAS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.
