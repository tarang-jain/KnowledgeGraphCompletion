AFTER MAKING AN IFR APPROACH, THE PILOT MADE A GO-AROUND BECAUSE HE 
WAS BLINDED BY THE REFLECTION OF THE LANDING/TAXI LIGHTS AGAINST THE 
FALLING SNOW.  THE PILOT LANDED THE AIRCRAFT AFTER THE SECOND APPROACH.  
THE PILOT SAID HE SENSED THE AIRCRAFT DRIFTING TO THE LEFT AND HE TRIED 
TO CORRECT, BUT IT COLLIDED WITH A SNOW BANK. THE INVESTIGATION 
DISCLOSED NO EVIDENCE OF AIRCRAFT HYDROPLANING OR SKIDDING.  AIRPORT 
MANAGEMENT ELECTED TO DELAY PLOWING THE RUNWAY FOR FEAR OF IT 
FREEZING OVER.  PASSENGERS CLAIMED THERE WAS 2-3 INCHES OF SNOW ON TOP 
OF A 3/4- INCH LAYER OF SLUSH.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE 
RUNWAY LIGHTS WERE OF VARIOUS INTENSITIES BECAUSE SOME UNAPPROVED 
LIGHT BULBS OF DIFFERENT AMPERAGE WERE USED.  THE RUNWAY WAS NOT 
EQUIPPED WITH CENTERLINE LIGHTING.  THE PAINTED WHITE CENTERLINE STRIPE 
WAS COVERED BY SNOW AND SLUSH.
