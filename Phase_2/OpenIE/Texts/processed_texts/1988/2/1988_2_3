THE CREW RPRTD THAT DRG TAKEOFF, A POWER SURGE OCCURRED AFTER THE 
AIRCRAFT HAD CLIMBED ABOUT 400 TO 500 FT. THE COPILOT SAW WHAT HE LATER SAID 
WAS A RIGHT FUEL FLOW FLUCTUATION AND TOLD THE PILOT (PIC) THAT THE RIGHT 
ENG WAS LOSING POWER. THE PIC TOLD THE COPILOT TO SECURE THE ENG. 
ANTICIPATING NO SERIOUS PROBLEM, THE PIC INTENDED TO REMAIN IN THE 
PATTERN AND MAKE A SINGLE ENG LANDING. HOWEVER, HE WAS UNABLE TO MAINT 
SPEED WITHOUT DSCNDG AND WAS FORCED TO LAND. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE AIRCRAFT 
WENT THRU A FENCE, CROSSED A RAILROAD TRACK AND STOPPED ON A ROAD. DRG AN 
OPNL CHECK OF THE ENGS, THE RIGHT ENG STARTED AND RAN NORMALLY. HOWEVER, 
THE LEFT ENG WAS DIFFICULT TO START AND WOULD NOT RUN ABOVE 1000 RPM 
UNTIL ANOTHER FUEL METERING VALVE WAS INSTALLED. A TEARDOWN OF THE 
FAULTY METERING VALVE REVEALED CONTAMINATION FROM AN UNKNOWN 
SOURCE. ALSO, THE LEFT FUEL PUMP DISCHARGE PRESSURE WAS FOUND TO BE 62 
PSI. AN ADJUSTMENT OF THE ALTITUDE ANEROID CONTROL RETURNED THE PUMP 
DISCHARGE PRESSURE TO WITHIN THE MAX LIMIT OF 32.5 PSI.
