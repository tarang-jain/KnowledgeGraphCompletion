THE SEAPLANE COLLIDED WITH THE WATER SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF. THE PILOT 
RPTD THAT A LARGE SPIDER DROPPED IN FRONT OF HIM AND DISTRACTED HIM. 
THE AIRPLANE WAS IN A GRADUAL RIGHT TURN ABOUT 100 FEET ABOVE THE WATER 
AT THE TIME. HE ATTEMPTED TO SWAT THE SPIDER WITH HIS HAT AND 
INADVERTENTLY ALLOWED THE AIRPLANE TO DESCEND INTO THE WATER. THE 
AIRPLANE FLIPPED OVER AND CAME TO REST INVERTED. HE EXITED THE AIRPLANE 
AS IT SANK AND WAS RESCUED BY A FISHERMAN. THE PILOT NOTED THAT THE WATER 
WAS GLASSY AND THAT THE SKY WAS OVERCAST AT THE TIME. HE INDICATED THAT 
THE LACK OF NEARBY OUTSIDE VISUAL REFERENCES CONTRIBUTED TO HIS 
INADVERTENTLY ALLOWING THE AIRPLANE TO DESCEND INTO THE WATER.
