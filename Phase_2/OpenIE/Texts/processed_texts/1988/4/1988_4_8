A CERTIFICATED PRIVATE PILOT AND HIS INSTRUCTOR, CONDUCTING TRAINING IN 
A 172P, WERE TURNING LEFT TO A SOUTHEASTERLY HEADING AT 3,400 FEET MSL, 
NEAR AN UNCONTROLLED AIRPORT. A CESSNA 172N ON A PLEASURE FLIGHT IN THE 
VICINITY WAS CLIMBING ON A SOUTHWESTERLY HEADING TO A CRUISE ALTITUDE 
OF 4,500 FEET MSL. A THIRD 172 WAS CLIMBING THROUGH 3,400 FEET MSL TO A 
7,500 FEET MSL ALTITUDE ON A NORTHWEST HEADING. AS THE THREE AIRCRAFT 
MERGED AT 3,400 FEET MSL THE INSTRUMENT TRAINING CESSNA 172P AND THE 
PLEASURE FLIGHT 172N COLLIDED. THE CESSNA 172P'S EMPENNAGE WAS SEVERED 
AND THE AIRCRAFT PLUMMETED TO THE GROUND. THE IMPACT FATALLY INJURED 
THE INSTRUCTOR PILOT AND SERIOUSLY INJURED THE PRIVATE PILOT. THE CESSNA 
172N WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED BUT LANDED WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. 
THE THIRD AIRCRAFT WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE COLLISION AND ITS PILOT DID 
NOT OBSERVE THE OTHER AIRCRAFT.
