THE PILOT HAD JUST TAKEN OFF FROM A PRIVATE STRIP AND IMMEDIATELY 
ENTERED A HIGH ANGLE OF BANK TURN TO THE LEFT AT LOW ALTITUDE. A 
WITNESS, WHO WAS AN EXPERIENCED AEROBATIC PILOT, ESTIMATED THE ANGLE 
OF BANK TO APPROACH 90 DEGREES. THE NOSE WAS SEEN TO PITCH DOWN, AND 
THE AIRPLANE DISAPPEARED BELOW THE TREE LINE. IMPACT WAS IN A FARMER'S 
FIELD ONE-QUARTER MILE FROM THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY.
