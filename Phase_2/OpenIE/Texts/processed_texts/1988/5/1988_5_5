THE T-6 STRUCK THE C-150 FROM BEHIND WHILE BOTH WERE TAXIING FOR 
TAKEOFF. THE C-150 WAS STOPPED AT THE TIME. THERE WAS AN ANNUAL FLY-IN 
BEING HELD AT THE ARPT WITH ABOUT 300 AIRCRAFT IN ATTENDANCE. GROUND 
PERSONNEL WERE DIRECTING GROUND TRAFFIC. THE T-6 PILOT SAID HE WAS 
MOTIONED FORWARD BY GROUND PERSONNEL WHO HE RELIED ON BECAUSE HE 
WAS UNABLE TO SEE DIRECTLY AHEAD OF THE NOSE OF HIS AIRCRAFT. HE ALSO SAID 
THE TAXIWAY WAS TOO NARROW, WITH INADEQUATE CLEARANCE ALONGSIDE IT 
TO ALLOW HIM TO DO S-TURNS.
