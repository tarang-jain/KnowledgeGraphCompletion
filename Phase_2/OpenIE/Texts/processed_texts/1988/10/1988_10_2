THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE LEFT BRAKE FAILED TO FUNCTION DURING TAXI 
WHEN HE ATTEMPTED TO REDUCE SPEED AND TURN 180 DEG INTO T/O POSITION. 
THE AIRPLANE BEGAN TO TRACK TO THE RIGHT. HE RELEASED BRAKE PRESSURE ON 
BOTH PEDALS THINKING THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE 
RUDDER PEDAL INSTEAD OF THE BRAKE PEDAL. HE THEN REAPPLIED PRESSURE 
AND EXPERIENCED THE SAME RESULTS. AT THAT POINT, HE REDUCED THE POWER 
TO IDLE. THE AIRPLANE RAN OFF THE SIDE OF THE RUNWAY. TRAVELED DOWN AN 
EMBANKMENT, AND FLIPPED OVER. EXAM OF THE AIRCRAFT REVEALED A HOLE IN THE 
LEFT BRAKE-SYSTEM PRESSURE LINE BEHIND THE CO-PILOT BRAKE PEDALS. THE 
HOLE HAD RESULTED FROM CHAFING BETWEEN A MOUNTING CLAMP AND THE LINE. 
THE LINE AND CLAMP WERE PROPERLY INSTALLED. THE HOLE WAS NOT VISIBLE UNTIL 
THE CLAMP WAS REMOVED. CORROSION WAS ALSO NOTED ON THE LINE IN THE 
AREA OF THE HOLE. A SEARCH OF FAA SDR'S REVEALED NO REPORTS OF SIMILAR 
FAILURES.
