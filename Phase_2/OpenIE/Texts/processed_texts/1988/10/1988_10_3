ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, HE HAD REQUESTED THE AIRCRAFT BE FULLY SVCD WITH FUEL 
BEFORE TAKEOFF; HOWEVER, HE DID NOT VISUALLY CHECK THE FUEL. HE RPRTD 
THAT AFTER TAKEOFF, HE HAD FLOWN ABOUT 50 MIN WHEN HE NOTED THE RGT 
TANK, WHICH HE WAS USING, INDCD EMPTY. HE SAID HE NORMALLY FLEW FOR AN 
HOUR BEFORE SWITCHING TO ANOTHER TANK. BELIEVING HE HAD USED ONLY 9 
GAL FROM THE 30 GAL TANK, HE ELECTED TO DELAY SWITCHING TO THE OTHER 
TANK. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE ENG LOST POWER. THE PILOT MOVED THE FUEL 
SELECTOR TO THE OTHER TANK, BUT WAS UNABLE TO RESTORE SUFFICIENT POWER 
TO SUSTAIN FLIGHT. SUBSEQUENTLY, DRG AN EMERG LANDING, THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED 
WITH TREES AND A FENCE, THEN CAME TO REST UPSIDE DOWN. THE RGT TANK WAS 
FOUND TO BE EMPTY; ONLY 7 GAL OF FUEL WAS DRAINED FROM THE LEFT TANK.
