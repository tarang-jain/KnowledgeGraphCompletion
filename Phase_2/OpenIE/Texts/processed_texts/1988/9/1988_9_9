THE PRIVATE PILOT WAS DESCENDING TO THE DESTINATION ARPT AT THE 
CONCLUSION OF A 3.5 HR X-COUNTRY FLIGHT. THE PILOT SAID HE SELECTED THE 
RIGHT MAIN FUEL TANK AND FLEW UNTIL THE 'FUEL WAS LOW TO THE POINT OF 
EXHAUSTION.' DURING A RIGHT TURN, WITH THE GEAR EXTENDED, THE ENGINE 
LOST POWER. ALL SUBSEQUENT EFFORTS TO RESTORE POWER FAILED. THE PILOT 
ATTEMPTED TO GLIDE TO THE AIRPORT, AND RETRACTED THE LANDING GEAR, BUT 
WAS FORCED TO LAND IN A FIELD SHORT OF THE RUNWAY. THE AIRCRAFT IMPACTED 
WHEELS UP, AND SKIDDED 60 YARDS PRIOR TO COMING TO REST. THE PILOT FELT 
THAT THE ELECTRIC FUEL BOOST PUMP FAILED TO PROVIDE FUEL FAST ENOUGH 
AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT. A POST ACCIDENT INSPECTION BY AN FAA 
INSPECTOR FAILED TO REVEAL ANY PRE-ACCIDENT FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION. NO 
FUEL WAS FOUND IN THE RIGHT MAIN TANK.
