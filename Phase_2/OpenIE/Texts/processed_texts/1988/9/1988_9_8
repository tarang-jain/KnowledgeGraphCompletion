THE STUDENT PILOT SAID SHE HEARD A POPPING SOUND DURING THE TAKEOFF 
ROLL AND ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY THE DOOR CAME OPEN. SHE TRIED TO 
CLOSE THE DOOR AND WHEN THAT FAILED SHE ATTEMPTED TO ABORT. SHE 
RETARDED THE THROTTLE AND ATTEMPTED BRAKING BUT IT WAS NOT EFFECTIVE 
AND THE AIRCRAFT RAN OFF THE SIDE OF THE RUNWAY AND DOWN AN 
EMBANKMENT.EXAM OF THE WRECKAGE BY THE OPERATOR REVEALED THAT THE 
PILOT'S SEAT BELT BANGING AGAINST THE OUTSIDE OF THE PILOT'S DOOR WAS THE 
POPPING SOUND THAT THE PILOT HEARD. EXAMINATION OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM DID 
NOT REVEAL ANY EVIDENCE TO EXPLAIN THE PILOT'S REPORT OF BRAKE 
DEFICIENCY.
