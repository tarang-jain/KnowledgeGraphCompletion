THE PILOT LANDED THE HEICOPTER ON A DRILLING PLATFORM AND INSTRUCTED 
THE MECHANIC TO INSTALL ONLY THE FORWARD TIE-DOWNS.  THE MECHANIC 
SECURED THE FORWARD AND AFT TIE-DOWNS AND SECURED THE FORWARD ROTOR 
BLADES.  WHEN THE PILOT RETURNED TO THE HELICOPTER, HE REMOVED THE 
ROTOR BLADE TIE-DOWN AND THE FORWARD TIE-DOWNS, BUT NOT THE AFT TIE-
DOWNS. AFTER LIFT-OFF, THE HELICOPTER BECAME AIRBORNE IN A NOSE-HIGH 
ATTITUDE, SETTLED BACK ON THE SAFETY FENCE AND SLID BACKWARD INTO THE 
WATER.
