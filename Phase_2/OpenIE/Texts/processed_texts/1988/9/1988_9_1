DURING AN ATTEMPTED NIGHT LANDING AT AN AIRPORT WITH INOPERATIVE 
PILOT-CONTROLLED RUNWAY LIGHTS, THE PILOT MADE A SERIES OF LOW PASSES 
(APPROXIMATELY 6 PASSES) BEFORE TRYING TO LAND. THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED 
WITH THE TOP OF A TREE LOCATED SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT OF THE EXTENDED 
RUNWAY CENTERLINE. THE AIRCRAFT ENTERED AN UNCONTROLLED DESCENT INTO 
BRUSHY TERRAIN. THE INOPERATIVE RUNWAY LIGHTS WERE PROPERLY NOTAMED 
AND THE PILOT HAD RECEIVED A PREFLIGHT BRIEFING.
