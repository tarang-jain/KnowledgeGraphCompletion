THE COMMERCIAL PILOT WAS FLYING THREE PASSENGERS TO BUY CATTLE. DURING 
TAKEOFF FROM A 5,000 X 75 FT, WET GRAVEL AIRSTRIP, THE PILOT ELECTED TO USE 
ONLY THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY TO AVOID MUD. HE USED A SOFT FIELD TAKEOFF, 
WITH A NOSE HIGH ATTITUDE, WHICH LIMITED HIS FORWARD VISIBILITY. HE DID 
NOT NOTICE SEVERAL PILES OF GRAVEL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY. JUST 
PRIOR TO LIFTOFF, THE LEFT MAIN GEAR HIT A PILE OF GRAVEL AND THE AIRCRAFT 
TURNED LEFT, DEPARTING THE RUNWAY. THE UNDERSIDE OF THE FUSELAGE HIT 
ANOTHER PILE OF GRAVEL AND TORE A 3 FEET LONG HOLE IN THE FUSELAGE. THE 
PILOT ABORTED THE TAKEOFF AND TAXIED BACK TO THE STARTING POINT. AFTER 
THE ACCIDENT THE PILOT NOTED THAT THE LEFT MAIN GEAR WAS PUSHED BACK 
AND THE GEAR MOUNT WAS DAMAGED. THE FUSELAGE WAS EXTENSIVELY 
WRINKLED.
