DURING AN INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT, THE CFI AND STUDENT PILOT HEARD A LOUD POP 
WHILE ATTEMPTING TO LOWER THE GEAR IN PREPARATION FOR LANDING. 
SEVERAL FLYBYS PAST THE CONTROL TOWER WERE MADE TO CONFIRM AN UNSAFE 
NOSE GEAR CONFIGURATION. THEY FLEW THE AIRCRAFT AN ADDITIONAL HOUR 
AND A HALF TO LIGHTEN THE FUEL LOAD, ATTEMPTED TO LOWER THE GEAR WITH 
EMERGENCY PROCEDURES, THEN ATTEMPTED AN EMERGENCY LANDING. THE NOSE 
GEAR COLLAPSED AND CONSEQUENTLY, THE AIRCRAFT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY 
DAMAGED. POST FLIGHT INSPECTION REVEALED A FLAT NOSE GEAR STRUT, AND 
MECHANICAL PROBLEMS IN THE NOSE GEAR STRUT ASSEMBLY.
