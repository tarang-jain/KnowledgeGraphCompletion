THE PILOT HAD PLANNED TO MAKE SEVERAL PASSES OVER HIS PARENTS' HOUSE. 
ON THE THIRD PASS WITNESSES OBSERVED A WING DEPART THE AIRCRAFT AND 
THE AIRCRAFT FELL FROM THE SKY. THE AIRCRAFT CAME TO REST IN A RIVER. 
EXAM OF THE AIRCRAFT COMPONENTS REVEALED A SPAR AND SPAR ATTACHMENT 
FAILURE. COMPARISON OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS DISCLOSED AN 
IMPROPERLY CONSTRUCTED MAIN SPAR (WHERE THE SPARS ATTACH TO EACH 
OTHER AND TO THE FUSELAGE). A REVIEW OF THE PILOT'S LOG BOOKS DID NOT 
SHOW ANY LOGGED TIME IN THIS AIRCRAFT.
