THIS AG OPERATOR WAS FERTILIZING A FIELD. HE WAS MAKING REPETATIVE TRIPS 
WHICH TOOK ABOUT 10 MIN EACH. THE PILOT WAS AWARE THAT THE FUEL GAUGES 
WERE INACCURATE, READING LESS FUEL THAN WAS ACTUALLY ONBOARD. WHILE 
MAKING A SWATH RUN THE ENG LOST POWER AND THE AIRCRAFT STALLED DURING THE 
FORCED LANDING. POST ACCIDENT EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT THERE WAS NO 
FUEL IN EITHER THE AIRCRAFT OR ENG FUEL SYSTEMS AND NO EVIDENCE OF FUEL 
SPILLAGE AROUND THE WRECKAGE.
