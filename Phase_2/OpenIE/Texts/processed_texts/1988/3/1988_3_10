THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR WAS GIVING DUAL INSTRUCTION TO A STUDENT PILOT ON 
NIGHT LANDINGS. ON THE SIXTH TOUCH-AND-GO LANDING, THE INSTRUCTOR 
TURNED THE LANDING LIGHT OFF FOR A NO-LIGHT LANDING. THE STUDENT 
LANDED THE AIRCRAFT TO THE RIGHT OF CENTERLINE, AND BEFORE A 
CORRECTION COULD BE MADE TOWARDS THE CENTER OF THE RUNWAY, THE 
AIRPLANE STRUCK DEEP, UNPLOWED SNOW ABOUT FOUR FEET INSIDE THE 
RUNWAY PERIMETER LIGHTS AND NOSED-DOWN. THE INSTRUCTOR AND STUDENT 
WERE BOTH UNAWARE THAT THE RUNWAY HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETELY PLOWED. 
AN OFFICIAL FLIGHT PUBLICATION LISTS THE AIRPORT AS UNATTENDED AND 
UNMONITORED, AND RECOMMENDS A VISUAL INSPECTION PRIOR TO LANDING. THE 
INSTRUCTOR RECOMMENDED THAT NO-LIGHT LANDINGS SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED 
ONLY UNDER IDEAL RUNWAY/WEATHER CONDITIONS.
