THE STUDENT PILOT ELECTED TO INITIATE THE FLIGHT EVEN THOUGH THE FLAPS 
MALFUNCTIONED DURING THE PREVIOUS FLIGHT. SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF THE PILOT 
WAS UNABLE TO KEEP THE FLAPS IN THE EXTENDED POSITION. THE PILOT HAD NOT 
BEEN FEELING WELL ON THE MORNING OF THE FLIGHT AND FELT WORSE AS THE FLIGHT 
PROGRESSED. BECAUSE HE WAS ILL, THE PILOT DECIDED TO RETURN TO THE ARPT. 
PRIOR TO TAKEOFF HE HAD DECIDED HE WOULD LAND ON RUNWAY 36 IF THE FLAPS 
WERE INOP. ON TAKEOFF WINDS WERE FROM 270 DEG BUT HAD SHIFTED TO THE 
SOUTH/SOUTHWEST DURING THE FLIGHT. THE PILOT WAS SO PREOCCUPIED WITH 
WANTING TO LAND THE AIRCRAFT BECAUSE HE WAS ILL THAT HE FAILED TO ADJUST HIS 
A/S FOR A NO-FLAP LANDING. THE AIRCRAFT FLOATED 3/4 OF THE WAY DOWN THE RUNWAY 
BEFORE THE PILOT INITIATED THE ABORTED LANDING. THE AIRCRAFT CONTACTED TREES 
OFF THE DEPARTURE END OF RUNWAY AND COLLIDED WITH TERRAIN. A SPRING WAS 
FOUND ON THE FLAP HANDLE BTWN THE ROD AND RELEASE BUTTON. PERSONS 
INTERVIEWED DENIED KNOWLEDGE OF WHERE THE SPRING CAME FROM. THE 
FLAPS OPERATED PROPERLY DURING POST ACCIDENT TESTING.
