TWO FAA INSPECTORS WERE CONDUCTING CURRENCY TRAINING WHEN THE 
HELICOPTER LANDED HARD DURING A PRACTICE POWER RECOVERY 
AUTOROTATION. THE PILOT HAD DELAYED IN APPLYING POWER AND COLLECTIVE 
PITCH. UPON CONTACT WITH THE GROUND, ALL ENGINE INSTRUMENTS INDICATED 
NORMAL OPERATION AND THE ENGINE RPM INDICATED IDLE POWER. THE PILOT 
FAILED TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE ROTOR RPM. AFTER THE TOUCHDOWN, AN 
INSPECTION FAILED TO DISCLOSED ANY DAMAGE, BUT WHEN THE FLIGHT 
RETURNED TO BIRMINGHAM SUBSTANTIAL STRUCTURAL DAMAGE WAS NOTED IN 
THE RIGHT REAR SKID AREA.
