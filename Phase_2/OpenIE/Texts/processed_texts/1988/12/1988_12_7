ALONG THE FLIGHT PATH FOR OVER 1/4 MILE. POST CRASH EXAMINATION SHOWED 
THAT ONE STABILIZER BAR WAS MISSING FROM THE ROTOR HEAD AND HAD FAILED 
OPPOSITE THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION. THE STABILIZER BAR WAS NOT 
RECOVERED. THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF BLADE FLAPPING AND LOW ROTOR RPM 
CONDITIONS. NO EVIDENCE OF A FAILURE ON THE FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM, 
OTHER THAN THE MISSING STABILIZER CONTROL BAR WAS FOUND. NO EVIDENCE 
OF A ENGINE FAILURE WAS NOTED, ALTHOUGH CONDITIONS WERE PRESENT FOR 
THE FORMATION OF CARBURETOR ICE.
