The CFI stated that the student pilot was flying the airplane and while on final approach to 
runway 09C, with a 10 knot wind from 020 degrees, the airplane drifted into the grass.  The

The inadequate supervision of the student pilot by the pilot-in-command (CFI) for his failure 
to take the controls from the student and initiate a go-around earlier following the airplane

 On December 1, 1999, about 1330 eastern standard time, a Cessna 152, N46946, registered to 
Comair Aviation Academy, Inc., experienced a loss of directional control on landing and 
collided with a runway light at Orlando Sanford Airport, Sanford, Florida.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for the 14 CFR Part 
91 instructional flight.  The airplane was substantially damaged and the certified flight 
instructor (CFI) and student were not injured.  The flight originated about 1200 from the 
Orlando Sanford Airport, Sanford, Florida.
     The CFI stated that after takeoff, the flight proceeded northeast of the airport to practice 
maneuvers.  The flight then returned to the departure airport where the student pilot 
performed a touch-and-go landing on runway 9L.  Air traffic control then switched the airplane 
to runway 9C, and while on approach to the runway, the airplane, "...drifted into the grass on 
landing by crosswinds.  Student pilot was making touch and go, during the go around the 
aircraft touched down to the right of 9C and struck runway edge light."
     According to the 1353 local METAR weather observation at the Orlando Sanford Airport, in 
part the wind was from 020 degrees at 10 knots; there were no reported wind gusts.
