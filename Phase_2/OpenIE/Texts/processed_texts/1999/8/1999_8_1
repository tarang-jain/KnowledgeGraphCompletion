The certificated commercial pilot had landed on runway 28. He stated that the touchdown and 
the landing roll were uneventful, until the airplane's nose veered slightly to the right.  He 
compensated by applying full left rudder, but the airplane suddenly ground looped to the right.  
During the ground loop the left main landing gear collapsed, and the left wing collided with the 
runway.  The left wing and fuselage sustained substantial damage.  Wind conditions at the time 
of the accident were reported to be from 190 degrees at 5 knots.
