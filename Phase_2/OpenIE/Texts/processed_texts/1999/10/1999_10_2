N300SH, a Beech D-45, was destroyed on impact with terrain following a midair collision with 
N5367G, a Beech T-34, during a practice maneuver by the Lima Lima Flying Squadron.  Both 
aircraft departed in sequence from 6-ship delta formation to perform a maneuver called a pop 
top break.  The pop top break involved each aircraft to depart from the formation in sequence 
by entering a climbing 180-degree turn to follow the lead aircraft in trail.  The narrow area of 
the human eye's visual field is approximately 10-15 degrees.  A video tape of the accident flight 
shows a delayed entry into the turn by the D-45 relative to the T-34's  entry into the maneuver.  
The pilot of the T-34 stated that he did not see the D-45  prior to the midair collision.  The 
Lima Lima Flying Squadron did not have procedures in place to recover or adjust for 
maneuvers that were not successful.
the visual lookout not obtained by the pilot of the Beech T-34 and the inadequate procedure by 
the Lima Lima Flying Squadron.  The delayed entry into the maneuver by the pilot of the Beech 
D-45 was a contributing factor.
