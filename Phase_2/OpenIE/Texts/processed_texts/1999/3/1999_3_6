A Federal Express DC-10-10F sustained no damage during a near mid-air collision with an 
American International Airways Lockheed L-1011-385-1-15, 30 miles west of Salina, Kansas. 
The aircraft came within an estimated 1/2 mile horizontal and 0 feet vertical separation of each 
other. The FAA issued a Final Operational Error/Deviation Report.  The report indicated that 
an ATC controller '...dropped the data block on FDX3207 [DC-10] without transferring 
communications...' to another controller.  The report also indicated that another ATC 
controller, '...issued CKS303 [L-1011] a frequency change to 125.67 instead of the correct 
frequency of 127.65.  CKS303 acknowledged the wrong frequency correctly by reading back 
125.67.'  ATC recognized that both airplanes were NORDO but were unable to reestablish radio 
communications, although several means were tried.  The CKS303 First Officer reported he 
saw the DC-10 at their 8 o'clock position at 1/2 mile and same altitude.  He reported he turned 
to the right 30 degrees.  The FDX3207 pilots reported they did not see the L-1011 but felt its 
wake turbulence.  Current FAA regulations do not require any aircraft used exclusively for 
cargo operations to be equipped with any version of TCAS. 
The ARTCC personnel failed to maintain radio communications with both airplanes and failed 
to maintain IFR separation standards. Factors relating to the incident were the FAA does not 
require cargo airplanes to be equipped with TCAS and neither airplane was equipped with 
TCAS.
