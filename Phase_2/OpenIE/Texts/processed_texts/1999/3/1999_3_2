The pilot said the wind was 'steady at 14 mph, gusting to 24 mph,' between 240 and 260 
degrees, as he attempted to make a crosswind wheel landing on runway 20.  When the airplane 
touched down, the left wheel 'skidded' when left brake was applied.  The airplane ground 
looped and departed the right side of the runway, incurring substantial damage to the left wing.  
The airplane was FAA certificated under Type Certificate 3A24.  No maximum or demonstrated 
crosswind component is listed in the Pilot's Operating Handbook. 
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control and inadvertently allowing the airplane to 
ground loop.  Factors were gusty crosswind conditions, pertinent crosswind information not 
made available by the manufacturer, and FAA's inadequate certification and approval of the 
airplane. 
 On March 1, 1999, at 1602 mountain standard time, Cessna 185, N9823X, was substantially 
damaged when it collided with terrain during landing roll at the Durango-La Plata County 
Airport, Durango, Colorado.  The private pilot, the sole occupant aboard, was not injured.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed for the personal 
flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  The flight originated at Durango 
approximately 1545.
According his accident report, the pilot said the wind was "steady at 14 mph, gusting to 24 
mph," between 240 and 260 degrees, as he attempted to make a crosswind wheel landing on 
runway 20.  When the airplane touched down, the left wheel "skidded" when left brake was 
applied.  The airplane ground looped and departed the right side of the runway, incurring 
substantial damage to the left wing.
N9823X, a 1961 Cessna 185, was certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration under 
Type Certificate 3A24.  No maximum or demonstrated crosswind component is listed in the 
Pilot's Operating Handbook.
According to FAA's Flight Standards District Office in Salt Lake City, Utah, this was the pilot's 
fourth accident and the third one in this particular airplane, to wit:
August 16, 1989    Cessna 185    N9823X August 16, 1990    Mooney M20   N100JM June 13, 
1992       Cessna 185    N9823X March 1, 1999       Cessna 185    N9823X
