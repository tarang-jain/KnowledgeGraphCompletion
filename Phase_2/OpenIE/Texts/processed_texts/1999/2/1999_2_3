According to the statements of the three cabin attendants and the flight crew, the aircraft had 
been in light to moderate turbulence for most of the flight.  The seat belt sign was illuminated 
and several public address system announcements had been made for the passengers to remain 
seated with their seat belts fastened.  The flight and cabin crewmembers reported that at the 
time of the incident the turbulence had abated and the ride was smooth; however, the seat belt 
sign remained illuminated.  A 70-year-old male passenger in seat 23C got up and began 
walking toward the aft lavatory.  One cabin attendant told the passenger to return to his seat 
unless it was an absolute necessity to visit the lavatory.  The passenger, who has two artificial 
legs, declined to follow the cabin attendant's instruction and continued to the aft galley area 
where he fell, fracturing his hip.  The crew obtained medical advice by radio from Med Link, 
and, after consultation with a physician, the aircraft continued to its destination. 
The injured passenger's failure to follow the instructions of the cabin attendants.
