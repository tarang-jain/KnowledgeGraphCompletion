The helicopter's tail rotor made contact with the offshore platform's windsock during final 
approach to landing.  The pilot heard a buzzing sound followed by a right yaw.  He then 
executed a hovering autorotation to the platform. Inspection of the windsock support frame 
showed signs of tail rotor impact damage. 
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance with the oil platform's windsock on final approach to 
landing. 
 On February 1, 1999, at 1056 central standard time, a Bell 206L-3 helicopter, N6603X, was 
substantially damaged upon impact with a wind sock during final approach at the West Delta 
105B offshore platform in the Gulf of Mexico.  The commercial pilot, who was the sole 
occupant of the helicopter, was not injured.  The helicopter was registered to and operated by 
Petroleum Helicopters, Inc., of Lafayette, Louisiana.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and a company flight plan was filed for the Title 14 CFR Part 91 positioning flight 
which originated from the South Pass 25 offshore platform at 0915.
The pilot was positioning the helicopter to the West Delta 105B offshore platform when, 
according to the pilot's written statement, he heard a "buzzing sound followed by a right yaw."  
The pilot then executed a hovering autorotation to the platform.  The pilot stated that he 
suspected that the tail rotor blades contacted the wind sock during the approach.  The wind 
sock's internal frame showed evidence of a tail rotor blade strike.
Maintenance personnel reported that one of the tail rotor blades was missing approximately 
the outboard four inches.  The tail rotor gear box was torn from its mounting and the tail boom 
had sustained structural damage.
According to company flight records, the pilot had accumulated 3,893 hours total flight time, 
of which 2,517 hours were in the Bell 206L-3.
