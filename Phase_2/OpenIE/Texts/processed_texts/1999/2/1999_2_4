The instructor pilot was giving the student practice in forced landings when the engine suffered 
a sustained total loss of power.  The instructor attempted to re-start the engine with negative 
results.  He then conducted an actual forced landing in a rough field where the airplane 
sustained substantial damage.  A post accident examination of the engine failed to reveal any 
mechanical anomalies. 
the total loss of engine power for reasons undetermined.  Factors were total loss of engine 
power, the instructor pilot's encounter with unsuitable terrain, and the rough terrain. 
 On February 2, 1999, at 0900 central standard time, a Cessna 152, N67568, operated by a 
commercial pilot with an instructor rating, and a dual student pilot, sustained substantial 
damage following, a loss of power, and forced landing near Odessa, Missouri.  The instructor 
reported no injuries.  The dual student reported minor injuries.  The instructional flight was 
operating under 14 CFR Part 91, in visual meteorological conditions.  The local flight departed 
Warrensburg, Missouri, about 0800.
In his written statement, the instructor pilot said that he intended to instruct the dual student 
in emergency procedures.  He said that during a simulated loss of power, the engine actually 
did quit and the propeller stopped.  He said that he took over control of the airplane and 
attempted to re-start the engine with negative results.  He then conducted a forced landing 
where on touchdown the nosewheel dug into rough terrain and resulted in substantial damage 
to the airplane.
An examination of the airplane after the accident failed to reveal any mechanical problems 
with the engine.  There was continuity throughout, and the was fuel in the tanks and fuel lines.  
The engine control continuity was verified.  The engine was test run after the accident and 
operated.
