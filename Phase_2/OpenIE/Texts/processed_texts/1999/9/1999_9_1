During takeoff from an off airport river bank on a flight to spot moose, the airplane's left 
wingtip contacted tall brush.  The airplane spun around, and the right wing and right main 
landing gear attachment sustained substantial damage.  The private pilot said the winds were 
light and variable.  He indicated to the NTSB investigator-in-charge that he had landed and 
taken off from the same site on previous occasions, but failed to avoid contacting the brush 
during this takeoff. 
The pilot's failure to avoid obstructions during takeoff.  A factor associated with this accident 
was the high brush along the river bank. 
 On September 1, 1999, about 2030 Alaska daylight time, a tundra tire equipped Piper PA-18 
airplane, N9130D, sustained substantial damage when it contacted brush during the takeoff 
roll from a riverbank on Clear Creek, at 60 degrees 32 minutes north latitude, 144 degrees 46 
minutes west longitude, about 38 miles east of Cordova, Alaska.  The solo private pilot was not 
injured.  The flight was being conducted under 14 CFR Part 91 as a personal flight to spot 
moose.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight 
plan was filed.  
The pilot told the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC) during a telephone interview on 
September 13, and in his Pilot/Operator report, that during the takeoff roll, the left wing 
contacted brush located on the edge of the river, and the airplane spun around.  The right wing 
sustained substantial damage, and the right main landing gear collapsed.  He indicated the 
winds were light and variable.  The pilot said he had operated from the same area previously, 
but did not avoid striking willows during this takeoff.
