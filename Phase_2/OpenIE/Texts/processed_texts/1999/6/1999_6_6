The pilot reported that while landing at a privately owned airstrip, the runway 'appeared to be 
in good shape and dry.'  However, when the agricultural airplane's main landing gear touched 
down, 'the wheels sunk into the soft ground,' and the airplane nosed over onto its back.  The 
pilot reported that the landing area was 'dry in the middle and soft on the sides.' 
The pilot's failure to touch down on the dry area of the landing strip.  A factor was the soft 
terrain condition on the sides of the grass strip. 
 On June 2, 1999, at 1315 central daylight time, a Grumman G-164A agricultural airplane, 
N73PB, owned and operated by Double L Flying Service, of Wallis, Texas, was substantially 
damaged during landing near Monaville, Texas.  The commercial pilot, sole occupant of the 
aircraft, was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a flight plan was not 
filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 local aerial application flight.
The pilot reported in the Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report, NTSB Form 6120.1/2, that 
while landing at a privately owned airstrip, the runway "appeared to be in good shape and dry."  
However, when the airplane's main landing gear touched down, "the wheels sunk into the soft 
ground," and the airplane nosed over onto its back.  The pilot reported that the landing area 
was "dry in the middle and soft on the sides."
Examination of the aircraft by the FAA inspector revealed that an upper wing spar, the engine 
mounts, and the vertical stabilizer were damaged.
