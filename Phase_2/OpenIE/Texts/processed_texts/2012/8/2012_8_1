The airplane was on final approach to land after the completion of a local night instructional 
flight. The flight instructor was to demonstrate the proper pitch attitude and sight picture 
needed for a landing at night. On short final, just before touchdown, the airplane drifted off of 
the runway centerline to the left. Upon touchdown the airplane was still moving toward the left 
side of the runway. The instructor stated that with the low energy state of the airplane there 
was not enough room to perform a go-around safely. The airplane then exited the runway as he 
applied flight control inputs to correct back to the centerline. Upon exiting the runway, the 
airplane impacted a runway light on the lower portion of the right wing strut attach point, 
resulting in structural damage to the strut. The instructor reported that the accident could have 
been prevented if positive control was maintained during the landing phase of the flight.
The flight instructorâ„¢s loss of directional control during landing, which resulted in a collision 
with a runway light.
