The student pilot had performed two takeoffs and landings in the tailwheel-equipped airplane 
and then elected to perform a full-stop, three-point landing. The student pilot stated that he 
applied left aileron and right rudder control inputs to correct for a left crosswind during the 
landing approach; however, after the three-point landing, the airplane veered to the left. He 
attempted to regain directional control, but the airplane continued off the left side of the 
runway, where it collided with trees and bushes, resulting in substantial damage to the right 
wing. The student pilot reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that 
would have precluded normal operation.
