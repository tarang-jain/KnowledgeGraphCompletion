The pilot reported that during the takeoff ground roll with a left crosswind condition, the 
airplane began to swerve immediately after the tail came off the ground and the left wing rose. 
The pilot attempted to correct with aileron, rudder, and control stick inputs, but the airplane 
turned into the wind and the right wing and propeller contacted the ground. The airplane 
subsequently came to rest balanced on its right main landing gear, the propeller, and the right 
wing tip. The airplane's right wing and right aileron were substantially damaged as a result of 
impact damage with the runway surface. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during takeoff in a crosswind condition.
