According to the pilot of the powered parachute, he took off in a westerly direction with a right 
crosswind, and during the initial climb, the parachute veered left. The pilot tried to correct the 
direction of flight, but the cart struck a tree and then impacted the ground, seriously injuring 
the pilot and substantially damaging the metal tube airframe. According to a witness, the 
powered parachute was flying ﬁnormalﬂ until a gust of wind pushed it into the tree. 
Postaccident examination revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
powered parachute that would have precluded normal operation. The wind reported at an 
airport 4 miles to the southeast of the accident location was from 360 degrees at 5 knots.
The pilot™s inadequate compensation for the wind during the initial climb, which resulted in 
collision with a tree and terrain.
