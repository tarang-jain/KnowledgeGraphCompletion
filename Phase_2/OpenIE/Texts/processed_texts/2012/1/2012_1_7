Prior to takeoff, the pilot forgot to properly latch the canopy. Shortly after rotation, the pilot 
noticed that the canopy had partially opened, which resulted in a distraction and a loss of 
airplane control. Subsequently, the airplane contacted the runway, and the landing gear 
collapsed. The airplane came to rest upright on the side of the runway. Postaccident 
examination of the airplane revealed that the fuselage was bent and buckled. The pilot reported 
no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded 
normal operation.
The pilot did not maintain airplane control during takeoff due to his distraction with the 
improperly secured canopy, which he forgot to latch.
