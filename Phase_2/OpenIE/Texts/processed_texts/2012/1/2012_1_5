The pilot stated that the flight was conducted in visual flight rule conditions, and when he 
arrived at the destination airport he noted no airplanes in the area. He said that he heard no 
radio communications to indicate the appropriate landing direction, saw no signs of wind 
direction as he approached the airport, and the airport™s wind sock did not indicate a wind or 
direction. The pilot elected to land on runway 16. When the airplane touched down, an 
unexpected wind gust pushed the airplane right of the runway center line. The pilot tried to 
straighten the airplane; however, the left wing tip and the left horizontal stabilizer tip 
contacted the ground, sustaining substantial damage. The pilot stated that there were no 
preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operations.
