The pilot reported that, during the landing flare, he noticed a deer (or possibly several deer) 
move onto the runway. In response, he added power and attempted to maneuver away from 
the animal(s). The airplane impacted what he believed to be a deer. The pilot realized that the 
airplane had likely incurred damage that could hinder further flight, so he retarded the engine 
power and landed without further incident. The left wing sustained substantial damage to the 
leading edge. The pilot reported no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation. The Federal Aviation Administration Airport 
Facilities Directory for the airport contained a note stating that there are deer occasionally on 
the runway.
