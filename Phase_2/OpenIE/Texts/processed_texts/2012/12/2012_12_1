According to the pilot, the touchdown was on-speed, and she made a three-point landing. 
During the landing roll, the airplane seemed to weathervane to the right side of the runway, so 
the pilot applied left rudder. The airplane veered to the left and departed the paved runway at a 
slow speed. As the airplane exited the runway, the right main landing gear collapsed, which 
resulted in the right wing contacting the ground, which resulted in substantial damage to the 
wing structure. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during the landing.
