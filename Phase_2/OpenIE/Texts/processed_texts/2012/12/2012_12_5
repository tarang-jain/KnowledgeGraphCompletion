The pilot reported that the purpose of the flight was an orientation for two potential student 
pilots. The pilot said that he completed a visual inspection of the fuel tanks and that he 
estimated that the fuel tanks contained 10 gallons of fuel, which he determined, would have 
been adequate for the flight. The pilot completed two traffic patterns, and as he climbed the 
airplane to the downwind leg of the third pattern, the engine lost power and "surged" during 
the subsequent forced landing. The pilot requested an emergency landing to runway 13 but 
amended his request to runway 8 because the airplane was "too high." He subsequently 
determined the airplane was "too low" for runway 8, and the airplane touched down hard on a 
taxiway and skidded to a stop in the grass infield. The airplane sustained substantial damage to 
the cabin floor structure. Examination revealed that the airplane contained no fuel, and the 
pilot reported that he had exhausted his fuel supply.
The pilot's inadequate preflight planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion and a total loss of 
engine power.
