The pilot was landing on a narrow gravel runway adjacent to a gravel road. He reported that 
both the road and runway were covered with snow and that flat light conditions made it 
difficult to discern between the two surfaces. He inadvertently landed to the left of the runway 
on the rough road, which resulted in structural damage to the nose landing gear bulkhead.
The pilot's misidentification of a nearby snow-covered road as the snow-covered runway in flat 
light conditions.
