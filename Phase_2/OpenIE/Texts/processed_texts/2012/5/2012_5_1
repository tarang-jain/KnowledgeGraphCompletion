The pilot reported that he lowered the landing gear and set the flaps to 30-degrees while on the 
downwind leg to the runway. He added that, as he lined up the airplane on final approach, the 
airplane drifted to the right. After the airplane crossed the beginning of the runway, the drift 
increased, and the pilot tried to correct back to the runway centerline. The pilot further stated 
that the airspeed decreased and the airplane ﬁstalled between five and ten feet above the 
runwayﬂ. The airplane landed hard, slid off the runway onto a glass slope, and came to rest in 
an upright position. Examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the fuselage, 
including separation of the empennage section, forward of the vertical stabilizer.
The pilot™s improper flare and subsequent aerodynamic stall, which resulted in a hard landing.
