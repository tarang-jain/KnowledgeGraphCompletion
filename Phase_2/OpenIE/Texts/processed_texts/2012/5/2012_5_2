According to the certified flight instructor (CFI), the student pilot was practicing touch-and-go 
landings. During the second touch-and-go, as the airplane rotated for takeoff, it hit a deer. The 
CFI took control of the airplane, continued the takeoff, and established that there were no 
vibrations and that the airplane was controllable. The CFI elected to divert to a nearby airport 
where emergency services were available, if needed, and landed without further incident. 
Examination of the airplane revealed that the right wing strut and right gear mount were bent, 
and the right side of the fuselage was buckled.
