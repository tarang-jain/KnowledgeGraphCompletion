The solo student pilot intended to practice takeoffs and landings at a nearby airport. On the 
first landing, the airplane touched down on the main wheels and bounced. The nose landing 
gear subsequently impacted the runway, separating the nosewheel and landing gear strut. The 
airplane sustained substantial damage to the firewall and wing struts. The pilot noted that she 
had very little practice with straight-in approaches. In addition, she thought that using the 
traffic pattern to set up for the landing might have prevented the accident. The student pilot's 
logbook revealed that this was her second solo flight and the first time she traveled to the 
nearby airport without a flight instructor on board. She had logged a total of 1/2 hour of solo 
flight time prior to the accident flight. Several flights had been logged between the student 
pilot's home airport and the nearby airport with a flight instructor on board. The logbook 
contained a current solo endorsement and an endorsement for repeated solo flights between 
the airports involved.
The student pilot's misjudgment of the landing flare, which resulted in a hard/bounced landing 
and subsequent impact with the runway.
