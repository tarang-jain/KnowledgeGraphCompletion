The pilot departed with about 25 to 30 gallons of fuel on-board and proceeded to fly over the 
Atlantic Ocean. About 23 minutes after takeoff, while operating in visual flight rules 
conditions, the airplane was lost from radar about 34 nautical miles east-southeast of the 
departure airport. The pilot™s body and the airplane wreckage have not been located. The 
airplane™s maintenance records were reportedly in the airplane; as a result, information 
concerning the last annual inspection was not available. The airplane™s owner reported that the 
airplane ﬁperformed flawlesslyﬂ when he and another pilot flew it 2 days before the event flight. 
Multiple medications that had been prescribed for the pilot for the treatment of various 
conditions, including depression and anxiety, blood pressure, angina, high cholesterol, 
insomnia, and seizures were found during the subsequent investigation.  The investigation 
considered the possibilities of 1) pilot impairment/incapacitation and 2) suicide; however, the 
lack of physical evidence (the airplane and pilot remain missing) made such a determination 
impossible. 
Undetermined; the airplane and pilot are missing.
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On March 1, 2012, about 1102 eastern standard time, a Cessna 182P, N1338S, registered to and 
operated by Akro Attitudes, Inc., went missing and is presumed to be substantially damaged. 
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for the 14 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 personal, local flight from Willis Gliderport (FA44), 
Boynton Beach, Florida. The certificated private pilot is missing and presumed to be fatally 
injured. The flight is presumed to have originated from FA44 about 1039.
On March 6, 2012, the airplane owner reported the missing pilot and the owners missing 
airplane to local law enforcement. A law enforcement search of the residence where the pilot 
was staying revealed items including a Florida driver™s license, Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) issued pilot and medical certificates.
An individual reported to local law enforcement on or after March 6, 2012, that sometime 
before lunch on March 1, 2012, they observed the airplane depart from FA44, returning there 
approximately 15 minutes later, then depart FA44 again flying to the south.
On March 7, 2012, about 1042 hours local, the FAA issued an alert notice (ALNOT) for the 
missing airplane. The ALNOT was cancelled on March 8, 2012.
According to uncorrelated radar data (1200 codes and Primary Radar Returns), on March 1, 
2012, at 1039, a radar target was noted approximately .3 nautical mile and 145 degrees from 
the departure end of runway 09 at FA44. Plotting of the uncorrelated radar data revealed the 
flight continued on a southeasterly heading over the Atlantic Ocean. The last radar return of 
the uncorrelated radar targets was at 1102, and was located at 26 degrees 17.502 minutes North 
latitude and 079 degrees 39.228 minutes West longitude, or approximately 34 nautical miles 
and 117 degrees from FA44. That position corresponds to a location approximately 23 nautical 
miles east-southeast of Boca Raton, Florida.

horsepower Continental Motors, Inc., O-470-S engine and equipped with a McCauley constant 
speed propeller.
Records from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), located in Oklahoma City, 
Oklahoma, reflected several FAA 337 forms indicating changes to the original type design. 
Changes to the original type design included in part installation of Robertson full span wing 
trailing edge flap system in accordance with (IAW) Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) 
SA1382WE, installation of placards and decals per STC SE1997CE allowing the use of 
automotive fuel, installation of an Electronics International components consisting of a UBG-
16 engine analyzer, R-1 RPM indicator, M-1 manifold pressure gauge, and digital Volts/Amps 
meter VA-1A IAW STC™s SA00680SE, SA5924NM, SA5926NM and SA2693NM, respectively. 
Additionally, the airplane was also modified by removal of the existing autopilot system, and 
installation of a S-TEC System 30 autopilot system IAW STC SA09319AC.
The airplane owner reported that the maintenance records were last seen in the airplane. A 
document provided to or obtained by the NTSB pertaining to the last transponder check which 
was performed on January 27, 2012. The paperwork associated with the work indicates the 
aircraft time was listed as 4,777.03. A copy of the document is contained in the NTSB public 
docket for this case.
The owner reported that he and another pilot last flew the airplane on February 28, 2012. The 
flight was from FA44 to River Oak Airport (00FL), Okeechobee, Florida, then returned to 
FA44. Prior to departure from FA44, he added 40 gallons of 100 low lead fuel to the fuel tanks, 
bringing the total capacity to between 40 and 50 gallons. The round trip flight duration was 
about 80 minutes, and after returning to FA44, the airplane had about 25 to 30 gallons fuel on-
board. He also stated that the aircraft performed flawlessly including altitude hold of the 
autopilot system. After landing at FA44, he checked the oil level and none was used, and then 
wrote down the tachometer time in a little log that is kept in the airplane; he did not recall the 
ending tachometer time. The owner also reported that after the accident, he looked at the log 
for his portable fuel tank and no other fuel had been taken from it since fueling on February 
28, 2012; no other fuel was available at FA44.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
A surface observation weather report taken at Palm Beach International Airport (PBI) on the 
day of the accident at 1130, or approximately 28 minutes after the airplane was lost from radar, 
indicates the wind was from 140 degrees at 12 knots, and the visibility was 10 miles. Broken 
clouds existed at 2,800 feet, 3,800 feet, and also 5,000 feet. The temperature and dew point 
were 26 and 20 degrees Celsius respectively, and the altimeter setting was 30.11 inches of 
Mercury. The accident site was located approximately 33 nautical miles and 135 degrees from 
PBI.
According to WSR-88d base reflectivity imagery from Miami, Florida (KAMX), at 1102 EST, 
with the final portion of the missing aircraft™s flight path overlaid. No weather radar ﬁechoesﬂ 
were identified in the area of the missing aircraft™s final position at this time. The KAMX 
imagery from a scan that was completed with an antenna tilt at 0.52° above the horizon, at a 
distance of approximately 59 nautical miles from the radar, and considering the 0.52 degree tilt 
with a 0.95 degree beamwidth, at the location of the missing aircraft™s final position, the KAMX 
radar would have ﬁseenﬂ between approximately 2,600 and 8,500 feet above the water.
Review of rawinsonde sounding from Miami, Florida, at 0700 EST, indicates relatively light 
wind magnitudes (< 12 knots) between the surface and approximately 18,000 feet.
Visible imagery from the GOES-13 geostationary satellite at 1102 EST, identified fair-weather 
cloud formations in the vicinity of the missing aircraft™s final position. Cloud-top heights were 
estimated to be between 1,000 and 2,000 feet.
No Airman™s Meteorological Information (AIRMET) advisories were active for the area at the 
times of interest.
