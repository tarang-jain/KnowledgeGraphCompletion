The pilot reported that he was conducting annual refresher training with a certified flight 
instructor. During a practice autorotation to runway 18, the helicopter descended below a 
nearby tree line and then suddenly dropped. He stated that the helicopter descended so rapidly 
that he was unable to arrest the descent rate and the helicopter landed hard. The pilot reported 
that the wind was from 230 degrees at 10 knots with gusts to 19 knots at the time of the 
accident. He reported that, as the helicopter descended below treetop level, "â€“we lost all lift 
and wind advantage." The hard landing resulted in a fractured tail boom. The pilots reported 
no mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the gusting wind, which resulted in an excessive 
descent rate and hard landing.
