The flight instructor stated that he and the pilot receiving instruction were practicing traffic 
pattern work and had performed two simulated engine failures without incident before the 
accident. The flight instructor initiated a third simulated engine failure at a higher altitude 
than the previous two and suggested the pilot receiving instruction perform S-turns to lose 
altitude. During the maneuver, the airplane descended too low to complete a power-off landing 
to the runway, and the flight instructor told the pilot receiving instruction to perform a go-
around. The flight instructor also reached for the throttle to add full power for the go-around, 
but the airplane abruptly pitched down and impacted the ground, substantially damaging the 
wings and fuselage. Postaccident examination revealed that the pitch trim control was in the 
full forward (nose-down) position.

down position while attempting a go-around.
