The non-certificated pilot stated that he purchased the unregistered powered parachute on the 
internet. He stated that he practiced taxiing in the grass beside the runway at a private airport 
for 15 to 20 minutes at a time and that he would occasionally fly the powered parachute about 5 
feet off of the ground and set it back down in the grass. No one witnessed the accident, and the 
powered parachute was found in the grass beside the runway partially inverted with the pilot 
inside. The pilot reported to the responding local law enforcement officer that he was 
attempting to land the aircraft and did not know what had caused the crash. Postaccident 
examination revealed substantial damage to the undercarriage frame and engine mounts. The 
pilot did not keep a pilot log book, had received no flight training, and stated that he had not 
experienced any mechanical issues with the powered parachute.
