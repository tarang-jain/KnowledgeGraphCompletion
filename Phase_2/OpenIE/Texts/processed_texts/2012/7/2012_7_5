The pilot of the float-equipped airplane reported that he planned to step taxi while making a 
left turn and then takeoff. He applied takeoff power to get the airplane on step, then reduced 
power, and started a turn to the left. The airplane turned to the left sharper than he 
anticipated. He applied right rudder and reduced left aileron. As the turn started to straighten 
out, the airplane™s right wing struck the water and sustained substantial damage.  There were 
no preaccident mechanical issues with the airplane.
