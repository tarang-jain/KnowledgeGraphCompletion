The pilot stated that he was performing a touch-and-go landing. After touchdown, the pilot 
intended to retract the flaps, but inadvertently selected the landing gear control lever. The 
landing gear partially retracted, and the airplane settled onto the runway, resulting in 
substantial damage to a nose section bulkhead. A postaccident examination of the airplane 
revealed no evidence of any preexisting mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have 
precluded normal operation.
