The non-certificated pilot said that he had been flying his unregistered aircraft too low over a 
wheat field. He stated that he encountered a "thermal" and that the aircraft™s nosewheel caught 
in the wheat, causing the airplane to nose over and impact the ground. The aircraft sustained 
substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage structure. About 8 minutes after the 
accident occurred, the wind was reported as being from 320 degrees at 6 knots.
