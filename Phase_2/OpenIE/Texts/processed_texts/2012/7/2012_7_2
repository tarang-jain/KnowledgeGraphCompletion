During the landing roll with about 5 knots of crosswind, the airplane turned to the left, and the 
pilot tried to correct the turn by adding control inputs. However, the airplane ground looped to 
the left and came to rest on the side of the runway. The airplane sustained substantial damage 
to its wings and fuselage. The pilot reported that he had landed the airplane in the past with 
much stronger crosswinds and felt comfortable with the conditions at the time.
