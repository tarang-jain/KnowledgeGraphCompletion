The pilot reported that after a normal approach, he landed the tailwheel-equipped airplane on 
the main wheels (wheel landing). As the airplane decelerated during the landing roll, the pilot 
directed his attention inside of the cockpit and eased back pressure off of the control yoke. 
When the pilot redirected his attention outside, the airplane nosed down, and the propeller 
struck the ground; the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted. During the accident 
sequence, the wings and empennage were substantially damaged. The pilot reported that there 
were no mechanical failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation.
