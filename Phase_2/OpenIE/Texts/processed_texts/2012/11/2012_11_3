The student pilot reported that he was conducting a solo flight in the airport traffic pattern at 
the time of the accident. He stated that the airplane made a "soft landing on [the] main 
wheels." However, once the nose landing gear touched down, the airplane "darted" to the left. 
His attempts to maintain control were unsuccessful, and the airplane departed the runway 
pavement. A postaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies related to the nosewheel 
steering or main wheel brakes. The recorded wind was calm about the time of the accident.
The student pilot's loss of directional control during landing.
