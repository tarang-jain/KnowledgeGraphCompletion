The pilot departed a 1,500-foot-long grass runway in calm wind conditions and was unable to 
gain enough altitude to clear power lines at the end of the runway. He aborted the takeoff and 
landed in a plowed field near the departure end of the runway. The airplane nosed over on 
landing damaging the vertical stabilizer, the right wing tip, both main landing gear, and the 
propeller. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane or engine that would have precluded normal operation. He said the accident could 
have been prevented if he had waited for better wind conditions or extended the takeoff roll to 
gain additional airspeed.
The pilotâ€šs failure to maintain clearance from power lines at the end of the short runway, which 
resulted in an aborted takeoff and subsequent nose-over of the airplane.
