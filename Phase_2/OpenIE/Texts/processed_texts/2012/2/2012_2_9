The pilot was conducting a series of practice accuracy landings in preparation for a checkride. 
He reported that he inadvertently forgot to extend the landing gear. He added that he did not 
remember hearing the landing gear warning horn just before touchdown because he had 
allowed himself to become fixated on maneuvering the aircraft to the precise landing point. 
The airplane touched down on the runway surface with the landing gear retracted, which 
caused substantial damage to the fuselage structure. The pilot reported that there were no 
preimpact mechanical malfunctions with the airplane.
The pilot did not extend the landing gear before landing.
