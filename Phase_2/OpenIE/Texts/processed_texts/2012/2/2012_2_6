On February 3, 2012, about 1717 Pacific daylight time, SkyWest Airlines flight 6261, a 
Bombardier CL600-2B19, N912SW, was impacted by a belt loader at San Francisco 
International Airport, San Francisco, California, while parked at the gate and ready for 
pushback. There were no injuries to the passengers or crew members onboard and the airplane 
sustained substantial damage. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 121 
as a scheduled domestic passenger flight to Mahlon Sweet Field Airport, Eugene, Oregon.
After the boarding process was complete, the flight crew was informed that a belt loader had 
struck the airplane.  According to the operator, the driver of the belt loader that had been 
parked at the rear cargo door believed there was sufficient room between the loader and the 
airplane to make a forward right turn instead of backing up.  However, the front left corner of 
the loader impacted the airplane during the turn and caused substantial damage to the skin, 
stringers and a frame. 
the driver's failure to ensure that the belt loader was clear of the airplane before turning.
