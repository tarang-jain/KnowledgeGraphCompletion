According to the pilot, as the airplane approached the runway, he realized that the airplaneâ„¢s 
descent rate was higher than normal. The airplane touched down hard, bounced, and began to 
porpoise. The pilot attempted to abort the landing, but the airplane yawed left, its nose hit the 
ground, and it nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and the 
vertical stabilizer. The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or 
failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal flight.
The pilot's improper landing flare and inadequate recovery from a bounced landing.
