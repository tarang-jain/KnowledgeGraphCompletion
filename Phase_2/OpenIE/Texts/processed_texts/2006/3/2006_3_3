After landing, the pilot taxied to his hangar that he shares with an aviation maintenance 
technician with inspector's authorization.  As he taxied around a corner, he saw his car out of 
the hangar and another airplane in the hangar.  He knew where this other airplane was 
normally tied down so he turned his airplane 180 degrees and transitioned to the tie-down 
area, which was located near an airport fence.  The pilot was watching for chocks and tie-down 
straps on the ground while maintaining clearance between the right wing tip and the fence 
when the left wing impacted a light pole.
the pilot's failure to maintain an adequate clearance with obstructions while taxiing.
