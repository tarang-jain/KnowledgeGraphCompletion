The pilot did not ensure that the snow that had accumulated on the aircraft both prior to and 
after he began the taxi sequence was fully removed from the aircraft's wings prior to takeoff. 
During the takeoff, the aircraft did not lift off as it normally does, and the takeoff roll ended up 
being longer than usual. Once the pilot got the aircraft in the air, it was not climbing at an 
acceptable rate, so the pilot retracted the landing gear because he thought that action would 
help the aircraft to climb. Soon after the landing gear was retracted, the aircraft settled back 
onto the runway, hit a runway light, and then slid off the departure end of the runway onto a 
snow and ice covered field. According to the pilot, the engine was producing full power and was 
running very smoothly.
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from the terrain during the takeoff sequence. Factors 
include his inadequate removal of snow and ice from the wings prior to takeoff, his improper 
decision to retract the landing gear before it had been positively determined that the aircraft 
would not settle back onto the runway, and snowy conditions both prior to and during the 
takeoff sequence.
