The experimental amateur-built airplane impacted terrain during a forced landing to a field 
following a loss of engine power on downwind.  A ground fire subsequently destroyed the 
airplane.  Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any anomalies in reference to the 
engine's power loss.
The in-flight loss of engine power on downwind for undetermined reasons and the post-impact 
ground fire that burned the airplane while it was standing.
