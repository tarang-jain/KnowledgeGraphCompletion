According to the pilot, during the attempted takeoff, he raised the collective and the helicopter 
"became light on its skids."  The pilot verified the wind conditions based on his observation 
with nearby trees.  The wind was observed to be "light" and from the south-southwest 
direction.  The pilot initiated a turn into the direction of the wind, and prior to transitional lift, 
the rotor RPM dropped.  The pilot attempted to recover the drop in rotor RPM by lowering the 
collective.  The helicopter skids touched the terrain, and the helicopter rolled over on it's right 
side.  The pilot stated, "I believe I got a wind gust that contributed to the low [rotor] RPM."
the pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control during takeoff.  A contributing factor was the low 
rotor RPM.
