The 600-hour private pilot became lost during a 125-nautical mile dead reckoning cross-
country flight.  Running low on fuel, the pilot elected to land at a ranch.  Upon landing, the 
pilot realized that he was in Mexico, approximately 206 miles south of his intended 
destination.  The pilot quickly departed the ranch and flew in a northerly direction until he 
spotted a Texas flag.   Estimating that he had about 3 gallons of fuel remaining, the pilot 
elected to land on a gravel road before his remaining fuel was exhausted.  While on final 
approach to the gravel road, the pilot observed a tall fence running parallel to the road and 
elected to land off the road on rocky and uneven terrain.  While landing, the airplane's 
horizontal stabilizer sustained structural damage following impact with sagebrush and cactus 
plants.  The pilot reported that he did not have a navigational chart on board the airplane, and 
very strong winds aloft, with speeds up to 65 mph, prevailed throughout the area, forcing his 
airplane off-course.
The pilot's inadequate preflight planning and preparation leading to him becoming lost.  
Contributing  factors were the unfavorable winds and the lack of suitable terrain for a 
precautionary landing.
