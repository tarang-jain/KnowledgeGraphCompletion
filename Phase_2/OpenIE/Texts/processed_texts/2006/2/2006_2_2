The pilot stated that while in cruise flight she looked at the fuel gauges and the right fuel tank 
was empty and the left fuel tank was approximately a quarter full. The primer was stuck in the 
out position. She and the passenger attempted to push the primer in with negative results. She 
then decided to fly back towards the departure airport and while en-route, the engine lost 
power. The pilot stated that the airplane was approximately 1000 feet above the ground and 
she elected not to attempt an engine restart. She made a 180 degree turn and initiated a forced 
landing to an open field. The airplane landed half way down the field. She attempted to stop 
the airplane, but the airplane skidded through a barb wire fence, the left wing clipped a tree, 
and the airplane spun around 180-degrees. The airplane came to rest facing north. 
Examination of the airplane found the airplane contained no usable fuel and the primer handle 
was unlocked. A review of the primer's design drawings found that there are two check valves 
within the primers system which prevent fuel from entering the engine even with the primer in 
the out position. Fuel can only enter the engine through the action of closing the primer.
The pilot's improper fuel management resulting in a total loss of engine power due to fuel 
exhaustion.
