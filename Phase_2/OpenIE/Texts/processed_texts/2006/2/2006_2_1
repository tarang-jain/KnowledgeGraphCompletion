The pilot stated that he entered a left downwind for runway 06 and extended his downwind 
due to another airplane being on left base for the same runway. He turned final and made 
several s-turns while waiting on the other airplane to clear the runway. Once the other airplane 
cleared the runway the pilot stated, "I lined up with the runway 06 and flared to land. My main 
landing gear struck the end of the pavement and sheared the left main gear." The pilot did not 
report any mechanical problems before the accident.
The pilot's misjudgment of altitude/distance which resulted in an undershoot of the runway 
and subsequent impact with the runway collapsing the main landing gear.
