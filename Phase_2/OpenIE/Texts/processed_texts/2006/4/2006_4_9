According to the pilot, during the landing flare, a gust of wind "caught" the tailwheel airplane, 
which then veered off the runway and into a ditch.  The pilot also stated that the winds were 
variable at 10, gusting to 20 knots.  The pilot did not report any mechanical anomalies with the 
airplane.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll.  A factor was the 
gusting winds.
