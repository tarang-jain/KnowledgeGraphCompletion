While transitioning from landing to taxiing the pilot experienced a bumping sound, which was 
followed by the collapse of the nose gear.  Examination of photographs of the damage revealed 
that several inches of the nose fuselage structure had been ground down by contact with the 
runway pavement.  The nose gear was examined by an airframe and power plant (A&P) 
mechanic.  The mechanic reported that the nose gear drive tube was bent inboard 90 degrees, 
suggesting that the nose over center adjustment was out of tolerance, and a sufficient impact 
could cause the gear to unlock from the down position.  There was no evidence of mechanical 
failure or foreign object damage.
