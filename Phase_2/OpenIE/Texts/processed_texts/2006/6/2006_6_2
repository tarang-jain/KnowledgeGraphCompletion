The non-instrument rated commercial pilot departed on a maintenance test flight in a single-
engine agricultural airplane.  During the test flight the airplane's radial engine lost power and 
the pilot elected to execute a forced landing to a cotton field.  The airplane sustained structural 
damage during the forced landing.  There was no fire and the pilot was able to egress the 
airplane unassisted.  The winds at the time of the accident were reported from 040 degrees at 
11knots, gusting to 18 knots.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, who 
traveled to the accident site, confirmed the airplane sustained structural damage during the 
forced landing.  Additionally, the inspector reported that the aircraft ran out of fuel.  Despite 
repeated attempts by the Investigator-In-Charge (IIC), the pilot failed to return a completed 
Pilot Operator Aircraft Accident Report Form (NTSB Form 6120.1).
The pilot's improper in-flight planning resulting in the loss of engine power due to fuel 
exhaustion.  A contributing factor was the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.
