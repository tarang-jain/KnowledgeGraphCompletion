The aerial application airplane overran the runway into a field during takeoff.  According to the 
Federal Aviation Administration inspector, the pilot stated that he never reduced the throttle in 
an attempt to abort the takeoff from runway 11 (2,000 feet by 75, grass), which was dry and 
mowed at the time of the accident.  The pilot stated that he thought the engine was not 
developing full power because it used up the entire runway length in the takeoff attempt.  The 
airplane was powered by a Pratt & Whitney, R-1340-AN1, serial number 31239 engine.  No 
subsequent engine anomalies were reported.
The aborted takeoff not performed by the pilot.  A contributing factor is the reported loss of 
takeoff performance.
