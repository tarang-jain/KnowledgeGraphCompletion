The single-engine agricultural airplane collided with a set of power transmission lines while 
performing an aerial application flight.  The 15,000-hour pilot sustained serious injuries and 
the airplane was destroyed.  During an interview with a Federal Aviation Administration 
inspector, the pilot stated that prior to the accident the airplane was operating "fine."  
However, the pilot added that he had "no recollection" of the accident.  The FAA inspector 
reported that there were two sets of wires, a small local line and a set of tall, high-power 
transmission lines.  The pilot also told the inspector that the normal practice for them was to 
fly over both lines before descending to perform the application run.  The FAA inspector 
reported that he found a portion of the lower right wing resting near the location of the high 
power lines. The visibility at the time of the accident was reported at 10 statute miles, with no 
obstructions.
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from the power transmission line(s).   A contributing 
factor was the low altitude selected by the pilot.
