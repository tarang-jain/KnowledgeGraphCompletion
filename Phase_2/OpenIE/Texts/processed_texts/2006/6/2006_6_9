While executing a visual approach to runway 35, the 7,600-hour private pilot confirmed that 
the landing gear was extended.  The pilot reported, that immediately after touching down on 
the 5,000-foot long, by 75-foot wide asphalt runway, he noticed a lower than usual nose 
attitude and applied aft pressure on the yoke which resulted in the airplane becoming airborne.  
The pilot added that "upon settling back onto the runway" the nose landing gear collapsed and 
the airplane veered to the left.  According to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
inspector, who examined the twin-engine airplane, the pilot "made a hard nose wheel landing 
which caused the airplane to bounce back into the air." The FAA inspector added that, "Upon 
another hard landing the nose wheel blew out and the left main gear collapsed."  The pilot 
reported having accumulated approximately 300 hours in the same and model aircraft.  The 
wind at the time of the mishap was reported as light and variable.
The pilot's improper landing flare resulting in a hard landing and his improper recovery 
procedures for a bounced landing.
