The commercial certificated pilot reported that he was landing a tailwheel-equipped airplane 
while conducting a Title 14, CFR Part 91 personal flight.  During the landing roll, as the pilot 
was making a right rudder application, the nose abruptly veered to the right.  The pilot 
reported that the airplane ground looped to the right, and the left wingtip and left aileron 
struck the ground.  The lens covering a runway edge light fixture was also broken.  He said that 
he inadvertently applied the right brake as he was applying the right rudder correction.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during the landing roll, which 
resulted in the left wing striking the ground and a runway edge light.  Factors contributing to 
the accident were the pilot's inadvertent application of the right brake, and an inadvertent 
ground loop.
