The 20,000-hour flight instructor reported that while on an instructional flight at about 700 
feet above ground level (AGL), he reduced the engine power to idle, applied carburetor heat, 
and asked the student pilot to perform a simulated forced landing.  The student pilot elected to 
land in a nearby field on a southerly heading  The flight instructor added that the field was 
adequate for the emergency landing; however, it would require the use of full flaps to make the 
approach.  At approximately 150 feet above ground level (AGL), the student pilot applied 
partial power and began retracting the electric flaps.  According to the flight instructor's 
statement, he increased the throttle to full power and slightly lowered the airplane's nose high 
attitude.  However, the airplane continued to lose altitude and then stalled just before entering 
the trees.  There was no fire and all three occupants were able to egress from the airplane 
unassisted.
The flight instructor's delayed remedial action during a simulated emergency landing, which 
resulted in an inadvertent stall.
