The 2,000-hour private pilot of the single-engine airplane experienced a total loss of engine 
power during the initial climb.  The pilot reported that about 400 feet above the ground (AGL), 
the engine "abruptly quit," and he attempted a left turn to attempt to return to the field; 
however, he impacted trees and then the ground before reaching the runway.  The pilot also 
reported that he had topped-off the fuel tanks with 34 gallons of 100LL fuel at the airport 4 
days earlier.  An examination of the wreckage revealed that the carburetor bowl was half filled 
with what appeared to be rusty water.  The gascolator was removed and examined.  It did not 
contain any fluid; however, the inside of the bowl contained a large amount of corrosion.  The 
wing fuel bladders tanks were empty, and no folds or obstructions were noted.  The left fuel 
tank was breached, and no fuel cap was present.  The vented right fuel cap was in good 
condition, with a pliable rubber gasket.  No other evidence of preimpact mechanical failure or 
malfunction was observed.  The airport fuel provider reported to the FAA that fuel samples 
were tested on the day of the accident and found to be within specification with no 
contaminants.
The total loss of engine power due to water contamination in the fuel system for undetermined 
reasons.  A contributing factor was the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.
