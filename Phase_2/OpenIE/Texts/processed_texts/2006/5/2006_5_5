came on and stayed on. He said he was familiar with the flight area and knew there was a fire

impacted the ground. The pilot further stated that he was "impacted by a strong lateral wind 
gust from the east which swung the tail rotor into the low hanging cable. However, the nearest 
weather reporting facility did not report wind gusts at the time of the accident. The pilot also 
stated that there was "not a mechanical malfunction".
