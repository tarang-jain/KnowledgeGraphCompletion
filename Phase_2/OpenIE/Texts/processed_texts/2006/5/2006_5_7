The student pilot was conducting solo takeoffs and landings in a Cessna 172D, on a 3,496-foot-
long, 75-foot-wide, asphalt runway.  During his first approach to the runway, the airplane was 
high, and the student pilot performed a go-around.  During his second approach, the airplane 
touched down, and the student pilot applied the brakes.  However, the engine rpm increased, 
and the student pilot cycled the throttle in an attempt to reduce rpm.  The airplane 
subsequently traveled off the end of the runway and impacted a field.  The student pilot's flight 
instructor reported that after a good landing, he observed the airplane increase speed, and the 
tires were smoking as the airplane departed the end of the runway.  Examination of the 
airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector did not reveal any pre-impact 
mechanical malfunctions.  The wind was reported as calm at a nearby airport, about the time of 
the accident.
The student pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control while landing, which resulted in an 
runway overrun and subsequent impact with terrain.
