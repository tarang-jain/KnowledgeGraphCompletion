The glider sustained substantial damage when it ground looped and skidded to a stop while 
landing at a grass airstrip.  The pilot reported that after releasing from the tow airplane at 
3,000 feet above ground level (agl), no thermal lift was encountered so he returned to the 
airstrip for landing.  He reported that he experienced a sink rate that "seemed very excessive" 
during the downwind leg.  He "cut the pattern short" and turned onto the base leg, which 
resulted in the glider being high on the base leg.  The pilot reported that he deployed the 
spoilers, but he was slow to retract the spoilers due to the "heavy force required to push the 
handle forward."  The glider lost altitude.  The pilot reported that the left wing caught the grass 
about the same time the glider touched down with the nose about 20 degrees off the runway 
heading.
The pilot's inadequate approach for landing and his failure to attain a proper descent rate.
