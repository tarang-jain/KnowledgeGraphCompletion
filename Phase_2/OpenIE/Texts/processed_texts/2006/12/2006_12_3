According to the pilot, during the takeoff roll at about rotation speed, he felt the nose landing 
gear of the airplane "give way" and the airplane began to drift to the left.  As he applied right 
rudder to correct the yaw, he felt "a continued collapse" of the nose landing gear and elected to 
abort the takeoff.  The airplane's nose and both propellers struck the ground.  Examination of 
photos provided by an insurance adjustor revealed that both engines were displaced down and 
to the right.  The right engine firewall was torn from the engine nacelle, and the left engine 
firewall was buckled and distorted.  Additionally, the photos revealed that the nose landing 
gear fork had broken into two pieces, which allowed the nose wheel to separate from the 
airplane, resulting in collapse of the nose landing gear.  The pilot reported that "an aircraft 
structural engineer made the observation that my nose gear fork had an old hidden crack that 
could have contributed to the failure."
the pre-existing crack in the nose wheel fork, which allowed separation of the nose wheel 
during the takeoff roll, resulting in collapse of the nose landing gear.
