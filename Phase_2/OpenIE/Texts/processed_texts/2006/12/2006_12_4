With the eventual goal of earning a sport pilot certificate, an ultralight pilot and a 1,141-hour 
flight instructor planned to conduct a familiarization training flight in an experimental, tandem 
seat airplane.   During the take-off roll, with the ultralight pilot occupying the front seat and 
operating the controls, the airplane "ballooned."  The ultralight pilot reduced engine power and 
performed a normal landing.  During the second take-off from Runway 16 (a 3,200-foot long 
by 50-foot wide asphalt runway), "the airplane ballooned more than before" and the pilot 
elected to reduce the engine power and land.  The ultralight pilot stated that "the flare did not 
fully develop and [the airplane] landed harder than usual."  During the landing, the right main 
landing gear and the nose landing gear collapsed.   In the Recommendation section of the 
NTSB Form 6120.1, (How could this accident have been prevented ?), the ultralight pilot stated 
that the accident could have been prevented " with the judicious use of throttle in the flare, or if 
I had carried more airspeed to compensate for the possible loss of a gusting headwind."  The 
winds at the time of the accident were reported as variable at 8 knots.
The pilot's improper landing flare and inadequate recovery from a bounced landing which 
resulted in a hard landing.  A factor was the delayed remedial action by the flight instructor.
