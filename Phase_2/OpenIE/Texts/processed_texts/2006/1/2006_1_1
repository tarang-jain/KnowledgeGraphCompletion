The private pilot was on a visual flight rules cross country flight when he began encountering 
instrument conditions. The pilot continued into the instrument conditions for about 30 
minutes before asking Atlanta Approach Control for directions to the nearest airport for 
landing. The controller directed the pilot to two different nearby airports but both were below 
minimums. The pilot informed the controller that he was low on fuel and needed to land as 
soon as possible. The controller directed the pilot to the Columbus Metropolitan Airport, 
Columbus, Georgia. The pilot told the controllers that he would attempt an Instrument 
approach. The pilot attempted four unsuccessful approaches with the controllers talking him 
through each approach. On the fifth approach, at five miles from the runway the pilot stated 
that both engine's quit due to fuel exhaustion. The pilot called "mayday" and during the forced 
landing the airplane collided with trees and the ground separating the right wing, half of the 
left wing, and coming to rest inverted. The pilot did not report any mechanical deficiencies 
with the airplane during the attempted approaches.
The pilot's inadequate decision to continue VFR flight into IMC conditions, which resulted in a 
loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion.
