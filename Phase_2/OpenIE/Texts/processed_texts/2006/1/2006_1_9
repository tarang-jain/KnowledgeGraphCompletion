During the landing flare, the airplane touched down hard and bounced back into the air in a 
nose high attitude.  The airplane then collided with the runway nose down, and the nose and 
right main landing gear collapsed.  The airplane subsequently skidded to a stop on the runway, 
and incurred substantial damage.
The pilot's improper flare and recovery from a bounced landing.
