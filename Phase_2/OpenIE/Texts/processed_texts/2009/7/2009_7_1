The accident occurred during the student pilot's third landing on his first solo flight.  He 
reported that he flew the final approach between 72 and 74 knots and that he reduced engine 
power as the airplane crossed-over the runway numbers.  He stated that the stall warning horn 
sounded as he flared, but the aircraft did not descend onto the runway.  He reduced his yoke 
back pressure and the airplane landed hard on the runway.  The airplane then proceeded to 
bounce several times before stabilizing on a landing rollout.  An after-flight inspection revealed 
that one of the propeller blade tips was curled from contact with the runway and that the 
engine firewall was substantially deformed.
