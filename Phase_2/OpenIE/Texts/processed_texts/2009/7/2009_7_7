The student pilot reported that his final approach to the runway was high and that he "slipped" 
the airplane to lose altitude. As the airplane crossed over the runway, he pitched the airplane 
forward to prepare for landing. The student pilot stated that he "felt the [air]plane losing 
forward momentum and added throttle to compensate." The airplane landed hard, bounced 
back into the air, and began to drift to the left. As the student pilot attempted to abort the 
landing by applying full throttle and reducing flaps, the airplane landed hard and exited the 
runway to the left. Subsequently, the airplane impacted a ditch, which resulted in structural 
damage to the rudder, left aileron, fuselage, and engine firewall. The student pilot reported no 
mechanical anomalies with the engine or airframe prior to the accident.
