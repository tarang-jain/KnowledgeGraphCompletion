The accident occurred during the student pilot's third landing on his first solo flight.  He 
reported that his first two landings were uneventful, but the airplane landed hard on the third 
landing for unknown reasons.  An after-flight inspection revealed that one of the propeller 
blade tips was curled from contact with the runway and that the engine firewall was 
substantially deformed.
