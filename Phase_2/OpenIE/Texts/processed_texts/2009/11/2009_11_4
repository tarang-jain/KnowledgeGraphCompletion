The pilot had recently purchased the airplane and was enroute to his home airport with 
another pilot when the accident occurred. While on final approach to runway 25 the airplane 
was "exactly on course;" however, during the flare the airplane veered to the left and the right 
wing lifted. The pilot applied full throttle and initiated a go-around; however, the airplane was 
"already in a stall." The airplane then impacted a sign, substantially damaging the left wing, 
before it came to rest in the grass. The pilot was able to taxi the airplane to the ramp when he 
observed 2 turboprop aircraft taxiing to the ramp in front of him. The pilot believed he 
experienced propwash from the other aircraft while he was landing. He additionally reported 
no preimpact mechanical anomalies with the airplane. The winds were recorded as variable at 
4 knots at the time of the accident.
The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control during landing.
