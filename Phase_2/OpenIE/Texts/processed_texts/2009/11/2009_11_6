The pilot, who was making a visual-flight-rules approach to an 800-foot-long remote airstrip, 
overflew the runway to observe the windsock. Because he observed the windsock hanging limp, 
he assumed that the winds around the runway were calm, and therefore continued his 
approach. About the time he reached the approach end of the uphill-sloping runway, the 
airplane encountered a strong tailwind gust, which pushed it "â€“too far up the strip to land." 
The pilot therefore executed a go-around, but his decision was "too late" and he was therefore 
unable to outclimb the terrain on the departure end of the runway. During the go-around 
sequence, the airplane's landing gear came in contact with brush and it flipped over onto its 
back. Ground witnesses told the pilot that all morning the winds had been variable in direction 
and had been changing rapidly from nearly calm to gusting as high as 20 miles per hour.
The pilot's delayed decision to execute a go-around in gusting winds and with up-sloping 
terrain.
