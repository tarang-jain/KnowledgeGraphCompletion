During a local personal flight, the engine of the amateur-built airplane lost power without 
warning. The pilot looked for a field to land in, but overshot the field and impacted desert 
terrain.  During the crash sequence, the aircraft sustained substantial damage to both of the 
wings, the landing gear, and the firewall. Examination of the engine found that the rear 
connecting rod at the crankshaft journal was separated and exhibited severe heat distress 
signatures consistent with oil starvation to the bearing. The respective crankshaft journal 
displayed a dark black/blue coloration consistent with heat distress. The forward crankshaft 
journal and connecting rod remained undamaged.
A total loss of engine power due to oil starvation to the rear crankshaft journal.
