The pilot was on takeoff roll for runway 30 when he reported a gust of wind pushed the 
airplane to the right side of the runway.  The pilot's attempts to correct were unsuccessful.  As 
the airplane left the runway it veered to the right and down a sloped embankment. The pilot 
was still attempting to regain directional control but the airplane became airborne and stalled, 
contacting the ground with the right wing and collapsing the right main landing gear.  The 
airplane then cartwheeled on the right wing and came to rest upright.  The pilot was able to exit 
the airplane normally and was not injured.  Substantial damage was confirmed to the right 
wings and right main landing gear.  Winds reported from the nearest weather observation 
facility 17 miles to the south were 180 degrees at 8 knots gusting to 15 knots.
The pilot's loss of control during take off. Contributing to the accident was the crosswind 
component.
