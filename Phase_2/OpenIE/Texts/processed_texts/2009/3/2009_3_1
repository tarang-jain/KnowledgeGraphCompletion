Following six takeoffs and landings, the flight instructor exited the airplane to allow the 
student pilot to attempt her first solo flight.  During the first solo landing, the airplane landed 
hard, experienced a bounced landing, and upon recovery the airplane impacted nose-low, 
deflating the nosewheel, damaging a propeller tip, and resulting in structural damage to the 
airplane's firewall.  The airplane came to rest in an upright position and the student pilot was 
able to exit unassisted.  There were no reported anomalies with the airplane's flight controls.
