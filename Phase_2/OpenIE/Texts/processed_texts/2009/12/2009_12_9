The pilot was landing at a non-controlled airport where variable gusty winds were present. 
While on final, she encountered a right crosswind and then both updrafts and downdrafts as 
she crossed over a cliff under the flight path. The pilot said that while the touchdown was 
uneventful, as the airplane slowed during the landing roll it encountered a right crosswind gust 
and the right wing lifted. Although the pilot attempted remedial flight control inputs and added 
power, the left wing scrapped the runway surface and the airplane rotated to the left, exposing 
it to a nearly direct tailwind. As the pilot attempted to bring it back under control, the airplane 
nosed over onto its back. According to the pilot, there was no indication of any problem with 
the flight control or nosewheel steering systems. The pilot also stated that the winds from the 
north were unusual for this airport, and that she based her assumptions as to what would 
happen on the runway on the normal westerly or southeasterly winds.
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the variable and unfavorable wind conditions.
