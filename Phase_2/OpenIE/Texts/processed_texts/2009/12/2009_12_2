According to the pilot, he conducted a preflight inspection before taking off from the paved, 
2,000-foot runway. The takeoff was "normal," but the airplane's climb rate was "not enough to 
clear trees" at the end of the runway. According to a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, 
the airplane lifted off about 1,500 feet down the runway. The airplane's right wing 
subsequently hit a tree located to the right of the runway and sustained substantial damage. 
The inspector also reported no mechanical anomalies and confirmed compression on all engine 
cylinders. Photographs of the tree indicated that it was about 50 feet beyond and 50 feet to the 
right of the runway. Straight out and to the left of runway provided a relatively clear pathway. 
Using the ambient weather conditions, including a 6-knot headwind, the only takeoff 
performance data available in the pilot's operating handbook indicated that the airplane's 
takeoff distance to clear a 50-foot obstacle should have been approximately 1,450 feet.
The pilot's inadequate visual lookout and failure to maintain clearance from a tree.
