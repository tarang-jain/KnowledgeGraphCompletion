The pilot reported that the airplane, which was equipped with long range fuel tanks, had been 
fully fueled five days prior to the flight. After 3.8 hours of flight time, the engine began to surge 
then lost power. After unsuccessful attempts at restarting the engine, the pilot made an off-
airport forced landing during which the airplane nosed over. Postaccident examination 
determined that the right fuel cap was missing, although the chain and spring clip were still in 
place. The pilot reported that the purpose of the flight was to act as a safety aircraft for 
Operation Migration. She stated that most of the flying involves making right-hand turns, 
which results in a higher fuel quantity in the right tank than in the left. The right fuel quantity 
indicator was indicating 3/8 to 1/2 tank of fuel and the left fuel tank was lower when the engine 
lost power. The pilot and pilot-rated passenger viewed the top of the wings twice after the 
airplane was fueled:  once to install the canopy cover and again to remove the canopy cover. 
The fuel cap was not checked for security nor was the fuel level visually checked after the 
airplane was fueled five days prior to the accident.
A total  loss of engine power due to fuel starvation as a result of the pilot's failure to assure that 
the fuel tank filler cap was secured prior to flight.
