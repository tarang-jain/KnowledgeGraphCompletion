The pilot/owner and a pilot rated passenger flew to a local airport for a brief stop, and then 
continued to another nearby airport where the passenger performed a touch-and-go. He had 
begun a slight right turn during the climbout from the touch-and-go when the engine lost 
power about 250 feet above ground level (agl). The owner took control, turned back to the left, 
and tried to land on the end of the runway. He leveled off slightly about 20 feet agl, and then 
flared for landing. The airplane landed hard on the north side of the runway and the right 
wheel broke off. The landing gear dug into the turf, the airplane spun 180 degrees, and the 
right main landing gear collapsed. The airframe around the tailwheel and rudder sustained 
substantial damage. The owner indicated that the airplane had a header tank that was the only 
fuel supply for the engine in addition to the wing tanks that were used to supply the header 
tank. He used an electric fuel pump to manually transfer fuel from the wing tanks to the header 
tank. He stated that he usually did not let the header tank get less than half full since the fuel 
pick-up port for the engine driven pump is at the front of the tank. He said that he probably let 
the fuel level get too low on this flight. During the climbout with the nose up, he surmised that 
the header tank fuel pick-up unported, resulting in the loss of power.
A loss of engine power due to fuel starvation as a result of the pilot's inadequate fuel 
management.
