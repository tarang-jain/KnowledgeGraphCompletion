The commercial pilot was 500 feet above ground level on approach to his destination airport 
when the single-engine airplane lost power. The pilot made a forced landing to a rain-soaked 
field approximately 8 miles north of the runway. On touchdown the nose gear sank into the 
muddy terrain and collapsed. According to the pilot the airplane had approximately 15 gallons 
of fuel on board upon departure. An on-scene inspection of the fuel tanks indicated 2 1/2 
gallons in the left tank and 1 gallon in the right tank. The aircraft manual states 1 1/2 gallons of 
fuel is unusable in the tanks. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the firewall. The 
pilot and passenger were not injured.
A total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion as a result of the pilot's failure to refuel the 
airplane prior to flight.
