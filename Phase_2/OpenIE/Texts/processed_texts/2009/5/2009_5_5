The pilot reported that the accident occurred during a crosswind takeoff from a turf runway.  
He noted that the airplane encountered an intersecting asphalt runway with a height difference 
that tended to "launch" the airplane.  The pilot stated that he was unable to maintain control 
because of the crosswind.  He attempted to continue the takeoff, ultimately continuing beyond 
the end of the runway, across a road and impacting a field.  The airplane sustained substantial 
damage to the right wing.  The nose landing gear, right main landing gear and right flap were 
also damaged.  The pilot reported a left 90-degree crosswind of about 10 knots at the time of 
the accident.  He commented that additional flight instruction from an instructor familiar with 
the make and model airplane would have been helpful.
