The Boeing 777 airplane experienced a contained fan blade fracture in the No. 2, right, engine, 
a Rolls-Royce plc RB.211 Trent 895-17 turbofan, during the takeoff roll at the Hartsfield 
Jackson Atlanta International Aiport. The examination of the fan blade revealed it had 
fractured from a fatigue crack that had initiated at the intersection of the convex side aft corner 
of the shear key slot and bedding flank.  The examination of the fan blade also revealed the 
plasma spray coating was deteriorated and the dry film lubricant was almost completely gone.  
A survey by the engine manufacturer of the operator's 777 engine usage indicated that because 
of the loads and lengths of the flights, the operator was operating their Trent 895-17 engines at 
higher thrust levels with correspondingly high fan rotational speeds, which were still within the 
engine's operating limits, than any other operator.  The survey also indicated the operator was 
operating its 777 and Trent engines significantly more hours per cycle than any other Trent 895 
operator.  An analysis by the engine manufacturer indicated that the blade fracture was caused 
by a combination of the breakdown of the lubrication system and residual fatigue life usage in 
the blade root following the last overhaul coupled with the high operating stresses in the fan 
blade from the high thrust settings.
The fan blade fractured due to a fatigue crack that was the result of the combination of the 
breakdown of the fan blade lubrication system and residual fatigue life usage following the last 
overhaul of the fan blade.  Contributing to the fracture was the inadequate lubrication schedule 
established by the engine manufacturer that was not reflective of the operatorâ„¢s use of the 
engine.
