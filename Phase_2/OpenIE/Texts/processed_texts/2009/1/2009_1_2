The student pilot was conducting his first solo flight and had performed two uneventful stop-
and-go landings. As the airplane accelerated during the third takeoff, it began to veer to the 
left. The student pilot applied right rudder; however, the airplane contacted a snow bank 
located off the left side of the runway and nosed over, substantially damaging the airplane. The 
student pilot stated that the winds were calm and the ailerons were in a neutral position during 
the takeoff. He did not report any mechanical failures or malfunctions of the airplane.
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control during takeoff. Contributing to the 
accident was the student pilot's lack of solo flight experience and the snow bank located off the 
left side of the runway.
