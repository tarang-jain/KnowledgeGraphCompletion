The pilot reported that he performed a preflight inspection of his helicopter "including 
checking fuel tank was full and without water or other contaminants." The cross country flight 
was estimated to be one hour and forty-five minutes. Based upon past performance and lack of 
guidance from the manufacturer, he determined that the helicopter consumed about 13 
gallons-per-hour, resulting in a total consumption of 22.8 gallons of fuel, which would leave 
approximately 6 gallons remaining in the 29-gallon fuel system. After one hour and twenty five 
minutes of flight time and approximately 5 nautical miles from the destination airport, the 
engine quit suddenly. The pilot performed an autorotation maneuver; however, the tail boom 
impacted a dirt and stone pile causing substantial damage to the tail boom. Post accident 
examination by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that "the fuel tank was 
empty" and a "small amount of fuel was found in both the carburetor and the gascolator." 
Samples from both were verified to be free of water or contaminants. A slight indication of blue 
fuel stain was found at the fitting for the fuel line which connects the fuel tank and the 
carburetor. Additional inspection and testing was performed by the helicopterâ„¢s Airframe and 
Powerplant maintenance technician twelve days after the accident in an effort to determine the 
origin of the fuel leak; however, the results were inconclusive. Fuel stains were noted on the 
carburetor around the split line of the two body halves, and around the fuel strainer screen on 
the left side.
A total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion for undetermined reasons.
