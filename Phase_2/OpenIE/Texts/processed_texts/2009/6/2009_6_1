The student pilot stated that he returned from a solo cross-country flight and entered the 
traffic pattern for landing. During touchdown, the airplane's nose pitched up and the pilot 
subsequently pulled back on the flight controls. The airplane became airborne, then settled and 
bounced a second time on the runway. After a third and more pronounced bounce, the nose 
gear collapsed and the airplane slid to a stop toward the left side of the runway. When the pilot 
was asked how the accident could have been prevented, he stated that he should have 
performed an aborted landing after the first bounce. Examination of the airplane revealed 
structural damage to the engine firewall, engine mount, and the rudder. The student pilot 
stated that he did not experience any mechanical problems with the airplane before the 
accident.
