While on short final, the bi-wing airplane impacted a flock of birds.  Bird residue penetrated 
the windscreen and impacted the pilot in the face.  Temporarily blinded, the pilot attempted a 
go-around maneuver, but the airplane impacted the runway, nosed over, and came to rest in an 
inverted position.  The airplane's fuselage sustained structural damage during the accident.
