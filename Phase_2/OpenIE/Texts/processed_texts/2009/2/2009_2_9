While departing the airport, the airplane's landing gear system failed to fully retract when 
actuated by the private pilot.  Several attempts were made by the pilot to fully lower the 
landing gear, including the use of the "emergency landing gear system."  The pilot elected to 
return to the airport and land in the grass parallel to the runway.  During the landing the 
airplane's firewall was damaged.  An inspection conducted on the airplane revealed that the 
wire cables which operate the landing gear were insufficiently lubricated during the previous 
annual inspection which was accomplished 18 days prior to the accident.
The failure of the airframe and power plant mechanic to ensure proper lubrication of wire 
cables in the landing gear system during the annual inspection which precluded safe operation 
of the landing gear system.
