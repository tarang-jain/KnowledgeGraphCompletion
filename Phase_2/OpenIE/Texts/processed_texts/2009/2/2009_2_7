While en route to her destination, the pilot elected to fly the helicopter up a canyon toward 
rising terrain. Soon after making a low pass over a ridge above 8,000 feet mean sea level, the 
pilot increased collective in order to climb over upcoming higher terrain. As the collective was 
increased, the rotor rpm started to drop. The pilot immediately increased throttle, reversed 
course to fly downhill, and lowered the collective. During the turn, the helicopter encountered 
a quartering tailwind and began to settle toward the snow-covered down-sloping terrain. Soon 
thereafter the helicopter contacted the terrain, bounced back into the air, and a main rotor 
blade severed the tail boom.  The helicopter rotated 180 degrees, impacted the terrain, and 
rolled over. According to the pilot there was no evidence of an engine power loss or any 
anomaly with the flight control system.
The pilot's improper decision to fly at low altitude while maneuvering in mountainous terrain 
in a canyon and inadvertently exceeding the climb capability of the helicopter. Contributing to 
the accident were a high density altitude, mountainous terrain, and a tailwind encountered 
during the attempted course reversal.
