The pilot of the Robinson R-22 stated that he was preparing for takeoff in the center of a non-
movement area. Upon advancing the throttle to 100%, the helicopter began to spin rapidly to 
the left while still on the ground. The pilot attempted to completely lower the collective lever 
while reducing throttle to stop the rotation, but felt no noticeable effect. He then pulled the 
mixture control knob to stop the engine, coming to rest at the edge of a non-movement area. As 
the helicopter spun, it drifted until the tailboom contacted a snow bank incurring substantial 
damage. The pilot stated that he was wearing a heavy coat and boots at the time of the 
accident, which may have interfered with his ability to operate the collective and anti-torque 
pedal controls.
The pilot's failure to maintain control of the helicopter during takeoff. Contributing to this 
accident was the interference of the flight controls by the heavy coat and boots the pilot was 
wearing.
