The certificated flight instructor (CFI) and student pilot departed on an introductory 
instructional flight towards a training area where they performed basic flight maneuvers. They 
then flew to an airport where the CFI demonstrated a simulated forced landing which was to be 
followed by a go-around to a runway that was reportedly covered with about 12-14 inches of 
snow. During the demonstration, the CFI reduced engine power to idle from an altitude of 
2,000 feet mean sea level and executed a descent to an altitude of about 5 - 6 feet above ground 
level at 60 knots indicated airspeed. The CFI did not increase engine throttle during this 
descent to clear the engine. The CFI applied full throttle during the go-around, but the engine 
hesitated and the airplane continued to descend. The main landing gear wheels followed by the 
airplane's nose contacted the snow. The left wing contacted the ground followed by the right 
wing.. Both wings buckled, resulting in substantial damage to the airplane. The Federal 
Aviation Administration Flight Training Handbook states in the section under 'Descents 
(Maximum Distance Glides)' that during power-off descents, the engine should be cleared 
periodically to prevent excessive cooling and fouling.
The certificated flight instructor's failure to follow correct engine clearing procedures. A factor 
was the unsuitable landing area.
