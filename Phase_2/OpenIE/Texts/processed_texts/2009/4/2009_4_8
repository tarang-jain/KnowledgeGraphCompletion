The private pilot reported that before landing on the frozen snow-covered lake in a ski-
equipped airplane, he intended to do a touch-and-go landing to check the snow conditions. He 
said that variable and gusty north-northwesterly winds required him to depart into an area of 
rising, tree-covered terrain. After landing to the northwest, he added full engine power and the 
airplane became airborne, but would not climb fast enough to outclimb the rising terrain. In 
the pilot's written statement to the NTSB, he stated that he: "Failed to fully recognize situation 
in time to abort departure..."  The pilot indicated that the airplane collided with tree-covered 
terrain at the departure end of the lake. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the 
wings, fuselage, and empennage. The pilot indicated that there were no preaccident mechanical 
problems with the airplane.
