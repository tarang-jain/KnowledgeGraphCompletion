The solo private pilot was landing a wheel-equipped airplane at an off-airport, snow-covered 
site. During the landing roll, the airplane bounced when it encountered a small snowdrift. The 
pilot said that he attempted to recover but the airplane drifted to the right and nosed over 
when it touched down in deep snow. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the vertical 
stabilizer, rudder, and wing lift struts. The pilot said there were no preaccident mechanical 
problems with the airplane, and noted in his report to the NTSB that he should have selected a 
better area to land on.
