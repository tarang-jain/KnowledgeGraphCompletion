The pilot was practicing takeoff and landings when he extended the landing gear and heard the 
landing gear motor start while the airplane was on the downwind leg to the runway. The pilot 
noticed that the landing gear was not down during the landing flare. The airplane touched 
down on the runway with the landing gear retracted, and the airplane skidded about 500 feet 
before coming to a stop. The airplane received substantial damage when the airplane's firewall 
and underside skin were damaged. During the airplane's recovery, the landing gear control 
handle was placed into the down position and the landing gear extended when the master 
switch was placed into the on position. Postaccident inspection of the airplane revealed no 
anomalies.
The pilot's failure to follow the landing checklist and extended the landing gear.
