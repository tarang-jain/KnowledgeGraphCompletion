The pilot aborted a previous takeoff because he was unable to maintain directional control of 
the airplane. He taxied the airplane to parking, inspected it visually, and elected to attempt 
another takeoff. During taxi, the control tower directed the pilot to complete a 180-degree turn. 
While turning, the pilot experienced a loss of brake pressure and directional control. He then 
applied asymmetrical engine power in an effort to complete the turn, but struck a fence post 
resulting in substantial damage to the left wing. Inspection of the airplane by the FAA revealed 
inoperative brakes on the airplane's right side.
The pilot's decision to continue to operate the airplane with inoperative brakes on the 
airplane's right side.
