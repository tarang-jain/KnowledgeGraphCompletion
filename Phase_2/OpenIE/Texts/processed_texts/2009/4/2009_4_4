The commercial pilot reported that he was landing on the frozen snow-covered lake in a ski-
equipped airplane. During the landing roll the airplane's main landing gear skis encountered a 
snowdrift, which stripped the nuts that connect the skis to the main landing gear axle. Both 
skis separated and the airplane's left main landing gear leg collapsed. The left wing struck the 
snow-covered frozen lake. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing and 
fuselage. The pilot said that there were no preaccident mechanical problems with the airplane, 
and noted in his report to the NTSB that he should have inspected the landing site before 
landing, then selected a better area to land on.
