The commercial pilot was on a Title 14, CFR Part 91, passenger flight in conjunction with his 
fish guiding business when the accident occurred. The pilot reported that he was flying about 
700 feet above ground level in his float-equipped, single-engine airplane, when he began 
transferring fuel from the auxiliary fuel tank to the main fuel tank, and the engine lost power. 
After a failed attempt to restart the engine, he said he was forced to land the airplane on the 
tundra. The pilot said there were no known mechanical problems with the airplane prior to the 
accident. He further reported that it had been raining for several days, and he should have 
sumped the fuel tanks prior to takeoff. He also stated that he should have initiated the fuel 
transfer at a higher altitude over terrain that was suitable for landing. He said the float 
attachments and the fuselage were damaged during the accident.
A loss of engine power during cruise flight due to water in the fuel, and the pilot's inadequate 
preflight inspection.
