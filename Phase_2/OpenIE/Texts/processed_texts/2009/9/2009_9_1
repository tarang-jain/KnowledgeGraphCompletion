The airplane was landing at a 2,100-foot-long dirt and turf remote mountain airstrip in dry 
conditions with clear skies and calm wind. During the flare and initial touchdown, the pilot 
allowed the airplane to drift to the left edge of the runway and the nose gear of the airplane 
struck a runway edge marker. According to the pilot, that impact "forcefully bounced the 
aircraft back in the air while dragging the tail." The airplane then "landed hard but 
controllably" on the left edge of the runway and the pilot steered the airplane back onto the 
runway. There was substantial damage to the forward fuselage and nose gear, but no injuries to 
the pilot.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing and his failure to execute a go-
around.
