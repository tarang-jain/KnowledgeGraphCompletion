The private pilot reported that he was landing his tailwheel-equipped airplane at his remote, 
650-foot-long private airstrip, at the conclusion of a personal cross-country flight operated 
under Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. He said that wind conditions required an 
easterly approach, over an area of stump-covered, 
down sloping terrain. During the approach, the airplane™s right main wheel struck a tree stump 
at the approach end of the site, and the airplane subsequently nosed over. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage. The pilot reported that 
there were no preaccident mechanical problems with the airplane. In his written report to the 
NTSB, the pilot noted that the accident might have been avoided if he had waited until wind 
conditions allowed for a different approach, or if he had waited to reduce engine power after 
clearance with the stump was ensured.
The pilot™s misjudged landing on a downsloping, short landing strip, resulting in a nose over.
