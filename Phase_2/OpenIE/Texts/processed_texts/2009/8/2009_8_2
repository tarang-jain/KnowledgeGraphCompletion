According to the pilot, during his approach to land he observed thunderstorms in the vicinity 
of the airport and observed moisture on the windscreen of the airplane. He elected to continue 
the approach and encountered strong turbulence during the base and final legs of the 
approach. During the turbulent encounter on short final, the airplane was turned 30 degrees to 
the right of runway heading and the nose was forced upward. The pilot regained control of the 
airplane and landed firmly on the runway surface. The airplane departed the left side of the 
runway, the left wing "dug" into the grass surface, cartwheeled, and came to rest inverted. The 
outboard four feet of the left wing and the firewall of the airplane were bent. According to the 
pilot and a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, there were no mechanical anomalies 
with the airplane. Witnesses observing the flight indicated that the wind shifted from a right 
quartering head wind to a right quartering tail wind and increased in velocity while the 
airplane was on short final.
The pilot's improper decision to continue the approach and landing during thunderstorm 
activity, resulting in the loss of aircraft control.
