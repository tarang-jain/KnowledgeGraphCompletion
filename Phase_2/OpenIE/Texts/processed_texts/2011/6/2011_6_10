The student pilot stated that he was conducting a solo cross-country flight in the tailwheel-
equipped airplane. He landed uneventfully at the destination airport, which was equipped with 
a turf runway, and to which he had flown with his instructor the previous day. After landing, 
the student pilot taxied the airplane back to the end of the runway to take off. He stated that he 
applied power to begin the takeoff roll, and the airplane lifted off the ground around 50 miles 
per hour. The student pilot lowered the airplane's nose to gain airspeed, and the airplane 
contacted the runway before impacting trees on the right side of the runway. A postaccident 
examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the wing spar, and no mechanical 
malfunctions or anomalies were noted.
