According to the pilot, she elected to land on an uphill runway with a tailwind and gusts 
present. She recalled that the wind at a nearby airport were indicating a tailwind at 11 knots, 
gusting to 17 knots. She decided not to use flaps and increased her landing speed due to the 
wind conditions. After landing on the grass runway, she was unable to sufficiently decelerate 
the airplane, which resulted in a runway overrun. The airplane collided with trees and 
sustained substantial damage to both wings. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical 
malfunctions or failures with the airplane.
