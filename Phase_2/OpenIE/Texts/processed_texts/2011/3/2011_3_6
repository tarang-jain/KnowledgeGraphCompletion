The pilot reported that he landed the airplane in a right crosswind and wind gusts. He applied 
a right crosswind correction, flared, and touched down with the right main landing gear on the 
runway. When the pilot removed the right crosswind control corrections, the airplane landed 
hard and as the nose wheel settled onto the runway, the airplane swerved to the left. The nose 
landing gear collapsed, resulting in substantial damage to the firewall and forward baggage 
compartment supports. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical problems with the 
airplane.
The pilot's failure to adequately compensate for crosswind conditions, resulting in a hard 
landing.
