The pilot landed with a left crosswind and the airplane started veering to the right. The pilot 
removed the crosswind correction while applying the brakes with the brake handle which was 
located on the control stick. The airplane continued off the right side of the runway. The nose 
landing gear dug into the grass and the airplane nosed over inverted into a ditch. Both wings 
and the tail section sustained structural damage. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical 
problems with the airplane.
The pilot's failure to compensate for crosswind conditions and loss of directional control 
during landing, resulting in a runway excursion and nose over.
