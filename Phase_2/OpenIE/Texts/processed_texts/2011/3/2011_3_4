The pilot-in-command (PIC) of the tailwheel airplane stated that he was flying from his private 
airstrip, with a friend who was also a pilot. The friend did not have much experience in 
tailwheel airplanes and had not flown the airplane from the airstrip. The PIC completed two 
takeoffs and landings uneventfully, and then let his friend perform the third takeoff. During the 
takeoff roll, as the tailwheel lifted, the airplane yawed to the left. The PIC then took authority of 
the controls and attempted to correct the yaw. The airplane traveled off the left side of the 
runway and impacted trees, resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage and left wing. The 
PIC reported no preimpact mechanical anomalies with the airplane and added that the wind 
was light and variable at the time. The PIC stated that he should have taken control of the 
airplane sooner.
The pilot-rated passenger™s loss of directional control during takeoff and the pilot™s delayed 
remedial action, which resulted in a runway excursion and collision with trees.
