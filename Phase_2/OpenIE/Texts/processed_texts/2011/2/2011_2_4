After completing several practice landings and autorotations at the airport, the certified flight 
instructor (CFI) and student pilot departed for the practice area. The CFI demonstrated 
straight-in and 180-degree autorotations; the first 180-degree attempt began at 6,000 feet 
mean sea level and at 55-60 knots. During the second 180-degree attempt, he started about 
200 feet lower. The airspeed bled off to about 50 knots during the turn, and the main rotor 
blades™ rpms began decaying rapidly. About 200 feet above ground level the CFI attempted a 
power recovery, but the rpms did not increase with an increase in throttle. He unsuccessfully 
attempted to flair to bring the rpms back before attempting a full down autorotation. He put 
the helicopter in a level attitude prior to contact with the ground and the helicopter bounced 
upon initial contact; on the second contact, the right skid dug into the muddy ground and the 
helicopter rolled onto its right side. The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the 
airframe and rotor blades. The pilots stated that the helicopter had no mechanical failures or 
malfunctions prior to the accident.
The certified flight instructor™s failure to maintain adequate main rotor blade rpm during a 
practice autorotation, resulting in a hard landing and rollover.
