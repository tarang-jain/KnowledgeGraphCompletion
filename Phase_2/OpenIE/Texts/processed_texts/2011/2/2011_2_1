The pilot pulled the airplane out of the unheated hangar on a chilly morning and used the 
propeller to rotate the engine several times. He set the parking brake, and started the airplane 
with the starter, but then the engine stopped. The battery did not have sufficient charge to start 
the engine, so he decided to hand-prop the engine. He primed it, left the parking brake on, set 
the throttle to idle, turned the master switch and magneto switches on, and spun the propeller. 
The engine started but did not remain running. He started it again by hand propping. He 
advanced the throttle to keep it running, but again it did not remain running. He applied 
carburetor heat, but did not reduce the throttle setting. He hand-propped the engine once 
again and it went to a high rpm setting, and then the airplane began moving forward. The pilot 
reached in to try to retard the throttle, but was unsuccessful. He fell and hit his face on the 
landing gear footstep, which fractured his right cheekbone and caused deep lacerations above 
his right eye. The airplane continued to move until it collided with a hangar, with both wings 
sustaining substantial damage.
The pilotâ„¢s failure to properly secure the airplane prior to rotating the propeller by hand, 
resulting in inadvertent movement of the airplane and collision with a building.
