The pilot said that he completed a preflight inspection at the beginning of his shift. He noted 
that earlier in the day, prior to the accident flight, he verified fuel control settings at the request 
of one of the mechanics. Both of these required that the engine cowling doors be opened. The 
pilot stated that prior to the accident flight, he visually checked the security of doors and 
cowlings, leaking fluids, tie downs, and the overall condition of the aircraft. He reported that 
after starting the number one engine, the flight medic commented that she heard an unusual 
sound. He subsequently asked her to check the security of the cowling door latches. When the 
flight medic returned, she informed him that the latches appeared to be secure. He stated that 
the flight proceeded without incident until about 1/2-mile from the destination helipad, he 
heard a loud bang and thump from the rear of the helicopter. Shortly thereafter the helicopter 
started to vibrate and he thought that the noise and vibration might be something from the 
rotor system. He elected to continue the approach to the destination helipad and subsequently 
landed without further incident. A postaccident examination revealed substantial damage to all 
four main rotor blades. The lower portion of the left engine cowling door was separated. No 
anomalies were observed with respect to the airframe side of the cowling door latches. The 
separated portion of the door was not recovered.
The pilot's inadequate preflight inspection of the engine cowling latches prior the flight, which 
resulted in the cowling door opening in-flight and striking the main rotor blades.
