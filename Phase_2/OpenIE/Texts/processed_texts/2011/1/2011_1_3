gear collapsed resulting in a ground loop. He stated to a Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) inspector that after landing the airplane seemed to oscillate then it pulled to the right, 
resulting in a ground loop into the grass on the right side of the runway. He also stated that he 
was not used to carrying a passenger in the rear seat. A postaccident inspection by an FAA 
inspector noted damage to the engine and strut mount assembly that was consistent with a 
hard landing.
