The pilot reported that the runway at the destination airport was ice-covered, and that upon 
touchdown the surface was slicker than he had anticipated. He aborted the landing by applying 
full power to take off. The airplane was unable to out-climb the rising terrain at the end of the 
runway, and it collided with terrain, sustaining substantial damage to the fuselage and both 
wings. The pilot indicated that there were no mechanical issues with the airplane that 
precluded its normal operation.
The pilot's misjudgment of the runway surface condition, resulting in an aborted landing and 
collision with rising terrain during the ensuing takeoff attempt.
On January 3, 2011, about 1350 Alaska standard time, a Beechcraft E18S-9700 airplane, 
N9001, sustained substantial damage during the takeoff phase of an aborted landing at the 
New Stuyahok Airport, New Stuyahok, Alaska. The airplane was being operated by Air Supply 
Alaska, Inc., Kenai, Alaska, as a visual flight rules(VFR) cargo flight under Title 14, Code of

realized that the runway was slicker than anticipated. He wrote that he applied power to abort 
the landing, but was unable to out-climb the rising terrain at the end of the runway. The
