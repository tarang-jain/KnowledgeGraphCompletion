The pilot was landing his single-engine experimental airplane in calm wind conditions, when 
the left main gear collapsed upon touchdown. The airplane veered to the right and the pilot 
attempted to keep the airplane on the runway by applying engine power and right aileron; 
however, the airplane exited the runway and spun, which resulted in structural damage to the 
fuselage. A postaccident examination of the left main landing gear strut revealed that the strut 
failed due to a pre-existing crack in the weld joint. The crack would not have been readily 
visible to the pilot during a pre-flight inspection due to the construction of the strut. The 
bracing around the strut exhibited signs of distress with twisted and shiny fracture surfaces. No 
other anomalies were found with the airplane.
