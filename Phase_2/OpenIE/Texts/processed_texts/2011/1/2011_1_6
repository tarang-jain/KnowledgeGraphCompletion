The student pilot was performing a landing when the airplane bounced several times before he 
lost control of the airplane. The airplane veered to the right and departed the runway. As the 
airplane continued through the grass, the right wing contacted a construction sign and 
impacted a ditch, coming to rest inverted. An eyewitness reported that the tailwheel never fully 
contacted the ground prior to departing the runway. No preimpact anomalies were reported by 
the pilot.
The pilot's loss of directional control during landing.
On January 2, 2011, approximately 0900 central standard time, an American Legend Aircraft 
AL3, N102PJ, impacted an construction sign and nosed over following a runway excursion at 
the Aero Country Airport (T31), McKinney, Texas. The student pilot was not injured. The 
airplane sustained substantial crushing damage to the right wing and vertical stabilizer. The 
aircraft was registered to and operated by Shell Air LLC, Olathe, Kansas, under the provisions 
of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a local training flight. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated without a flight plan. The local flight 
originated from T31 approximately 0855.
According to a statement provided by the pilot, upon landing at the airport, the airplane 
bounced several times before he lost control of the airplane. The airplane veered to the right 
and departed the runway. After departing the runway the airplane's right wing struck a 
construction sign. The airplane then impacted a ditch and came to rest inverted. The pilot did 
not report any anomalies with the airplane prior to the accident landing. A certified flight 
instructor saw the landing and reported that the airplane's tailwheel did not appear to fully 
contact the ground prior to the airplane departing the runway.
