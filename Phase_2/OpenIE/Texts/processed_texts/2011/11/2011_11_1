The pilot was on a cross-country flight at 9,500 feet mean sea level. About 20 miles from his 
destination, he started the descent to the airport. The pilot reported that he looked at his fuel 
gauge and decided to switch fuel tanks when the airplane reached 5,000 feet. As he leveled the 
airplane, the engine lost power before the pilot switched fuel tanks. He turned on the fuel 
pump and attempted to turn the fuel selector knob. However, the knob broke in half, leaving 
just the post. Unable to turn the post and restart the engine, the pilot elected to conduct a 
forced landing in an open area. During the forced landing, the left wing was nearly severed in 
two by impact with a tree, the landing gear collapsed, and the fuselage sustained substantial 
damage. After the accident, the pilot stated that he mistakenly turned the fuel gauge selector 
knob and not the fuel selector knob then got distracted by the knob breaking.
A total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation as a result of the pilot™s improper fuel 
management. Contributing to the accident was the pilot™s diverted attention with the broken 
fuel gauge knob.
