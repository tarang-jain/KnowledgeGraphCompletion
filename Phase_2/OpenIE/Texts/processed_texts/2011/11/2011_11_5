The airplane had been fueled and then flown for about 3.25 hours prior to landing at a private 
airstrip. After dropping off a passenger, the pilot departed from the private airstrip and was en 
route to a nearby airport when the engine experienced a total loss of power. The pilot 
performed a forced landing into a reservoir, which resulted in substantial damage to the 
ailerons. The airplane was recovered from the reservoir, and about 20 and 12 gallons of fluid 
were drained from the right and left wing fuel tanks, respectively. The fluid from the right tank 
was determined to be aviation fuel; however, the fluid from the left tank was determined to be 
water only and void of fuel. The fuel selector was selected to the left tank. The postaccident 
examination revealed no other anomalies that would have precluded normal engine operation.
A total loss of engine power due to fuel starvation, as a result of the pilot's improper fuel 
management.
