According to the pilot, his original intent was to start, run-up, and then taxi his airplane on the 
day of the accident. At the completion of the run-up, the pilot taxied the airplane onto the 
active runway for a "fast taxi" and applied full engine power. The airplane achieved takeoff 
speed, the pilot pulled back on the control yoke, and the airplane lifted from the runway. The 
pilot then aborted the takeoff and lost directional control as the airplane touched down on the 
runway. The airplane impacted a fence, resulting in substantial damage to the wings. The pilot 
reported that there were no mechanical deficiencies with the airplane.
