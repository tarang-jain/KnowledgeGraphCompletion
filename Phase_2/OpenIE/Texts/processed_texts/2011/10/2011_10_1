The pilot reported that he had finished flying for the day and had turned off the fuel shutoff 
valve and tied the airplane down. He noticed a family with a 10-year-old boy at the airport and 
offered to give the boy a ride around the field. The pilot untied the airplane, put the boy in the 
back seat, started the engine, and taxied to the runway. During takeoff, about 30 feet above 
ground level, the engine stopped and the airplane impacted the ground and obstructions on the 
edge of the airport. The impact collapsed the left main landing gear and deformed the forward 
lower fuselage, causing substantial damage. The pilot reported that he had failed to complete a 
preflight cockpit check and did not turn on the fuel shutoff valve. In addition, the pilot reported 
that shoulder harnesses were installed and available but were not worn.
A total loss of engine power during takeoff due to fuel starvation as a result of the pilotâ„¢s 
inadequate preflight inspection and failure to ensure that the fuel shutoff valve was turned on 
before departure.
