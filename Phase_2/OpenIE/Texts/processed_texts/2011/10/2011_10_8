Shortly after taking off and the landing gear left the ground, the airplane entered a bank of 
about 10 degrees to the left. The pilot initially assumed that the bank had been induced by a 
crosswind, but the bank continued to increase as the airplane's speed increased. The pilot then 
leveled the airplane about 75 feet above the ground and slowed to 50 mph in an attempt to 
evaluate the control issues. While applying full right control stick and full right rudder, the 
bank would not decrease, so the pilot attempted to perform a forced landing with the bank 
angle about 45 degrees. When the pilot decreased engine power, the airplane nose rose, and 
the airplane stalled and spun to the left. The airplane subsequently impacted the ground, 
resulting in substantial damage to the nose, cockpit, and left wing. No broken flight control 
cables were found during a postaccident examination; however, due to the extent of impact-
related damage to the airplane, operation of the ailerons could not be verified. When asked 
how the accident could have been prevented, the pilot suggested that a precautionary/aborted 
landing should have been undertaken upon the first indication of control issues during the 
takeoff. The airplane's ballistic parachute system did not activate. 
The pilot's delayed decision to abort the takeoff.
