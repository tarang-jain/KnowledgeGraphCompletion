descended into the field to continue spraying. He reported that the helicopter impacted an 
unmarked wire that was strung diagonally between the road he was paralleling and the corner 
of the property. The helicopter impacted the field and the main rotor blades separated from the 
airframe, causing the helicopter to cartwheel prior coming to a stop. The helicopter sustained 
substantial damage to the main rotor blades and fuselage. The pilot reported that there was no 
mechanical malfunction or failure of the helicopter prior to the wire strike.
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from the wire.
