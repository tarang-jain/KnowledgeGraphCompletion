The tailwheel-equipped experimental amateur-built airplane was departing from a turf runway 
at night. The pilot reported that he observed two deer crossing the runway and swerved to 
avoid them. At that time, a flashlight fell from the top of the instrument panel to the floor of the 
cockpit. The pilot looked down to retrieve the flashlight and did not realize that the airplane 
had veered off the runway. He subsequently noticed that the airplane did not feel right, looked 
up, and observed that the airplane was approaching the tree line. The pilot reduced the engine 
power to idle and applied brakes; however, the airplane struck trees, which resulted in 
substantial damage to the left wing. The pilot stated that he did not experience any mechanical 
malfunctions with the airplane.
The pilot did not maintain directional control during takeoff at night due to his distraction with 
a dropped flashlight, and he delayed his decision to abort the takeoff.
