The certified flight instructor (CFI) was demonstrating a touchdown autorotation from an 
altitude of 1,500 feet above ground level to a turf runway. He stated that, during the maneuver, 
the helicopter's sink rate seemed high, so he continued to pull pitch to arrest the descent rate. 
The helicopter touched down with a slight forward speed on a downhill slope, and the rear 
portion of the skids became momentarily stuck in the soft turf. The helicopter pitched forward 
after breaking loose from the turf, and the main rotor blade contacted the vertical stabilizers 
and tail rotor drive shaft cover, resulting in substantial damage. The CFI stated that there were 
no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies with the helicopter.
The certified flight instructor did not select an adequate landing site for the practice 
autorotation.
