The student pilot stated that she was completing her first solo cross-country flight. She landed 
the airplane on its main landing gear but it bounced. She then decreased the pitch of the 
airplane's nose, resulting in the nosewheel touching down independently of the main landing 
gear. The airplane's nosewheel strut broke loose from its attachments and was driven into the 
engine compartment, which resulted in substantial damage to the firewall. She was able to 
keep the airplane on the runway during the entire landing sequence and roll. She taxied the 
airplane off of the runway and did not report any mechanical anomalies with the aircraft. 
The student pilot's improper recovery from a bounced landing.
