According to a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, the pilot experienced a loss of lift 
while soaring and performed an 
off-field landing to a pasture. During the landing, a gust of wind blew the glider down an 
embankment and into a barbed wire fence. During the impact with the fence, the left wing 
sustained leading edge damage, and the empennage separated partially from the fuselage. A 
postaccident examination of the glider and its systems revealed no preimpact malfunctions or 
failures.
