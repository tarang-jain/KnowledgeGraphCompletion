fast. During the second attempt to land, the airplane landed hard and departed the right side of 
the runway. The right main landing gear separated and the nose gear collapsed. A postaccident 
examination of the airframe revealed that the engine was partially separated from the fuselage 
and there was substantial damage to the right-wing spar box. The pilot did not report any 
preaccident mechanical anomalies or failures.
