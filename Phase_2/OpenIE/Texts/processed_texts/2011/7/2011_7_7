Following a cross-country flight, the pilot lost directional control of the tailwheel-equipped 
airplane during the landing roll. The airplane exited the side of the runway and ground-looped 
before coming to rest in an upright position. During the ground-loop, the right wheel broke off 
and the right wing sustained substantial damage when it impacted the ground. The pilot 
reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have 
precluded normal operation.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing.
