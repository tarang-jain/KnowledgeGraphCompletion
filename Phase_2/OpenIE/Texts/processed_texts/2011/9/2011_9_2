While returning to the airport after completing an aerial application, the pilot noticed a 
reduction in engine RPM and a rise in oil temperature. The pilot was unable to maintain 
altitude and he elected to execute a forced landing to a road. During the forced landing, the left 
wing contacted a tree and pivoted the airplane into trees. Postaccident examination of the 
airplane showed both wing spars and the right elevator were bent. Based on his observations 
during the engine failure and his past engine failure experience, the pilot suspected the main 
bearing failed within the engine. The engine was not disassembled for further examination and 
the cause of the engine failure was not determined.
The loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.
