According to the pilot, during landing the wind lifted the left wing of the tailwheel-equipped 
airplane. As the wing came back down, the airplane began to ground loop and the airplane 
veered toward the right side of the runway. Due to observed terrain obstructions, the pilot 
elected to abort the landing and applied engine power. He attempted to clear a row of trees, but 
the airplane struck the trees and fell to the ground. The pilot reported that there were no 
anomalies with regard to the airplane. The airplane damage included bending of the left wing.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing and his failure to maintain 
clearance from trees during the attempted aborted landing.
