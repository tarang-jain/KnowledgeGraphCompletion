The pilot stated that, while on a local flight, he was circling a field when the engine stopped 
running. He then executed a forced landing to the field, which was not uniformly level. During 
the landing the right wing hit the ground and the airplane cartwheeled before coming to rest 
upside down. The pilot stated that he believed that water got into the gasoline, which caused 
the engine to stop running. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the wing 
was substantially damaged. No registration number was present on the airplane and no data 
plate was present on either the airplane or the engine. Review of Federal Aviation 
Administration records revealed that the airplane was not registered and the pilot was not 
certificated. The FAA also advised the NTSB that no maintenance records were recovered. 
A total loss of engine power due to fuel contamination.
