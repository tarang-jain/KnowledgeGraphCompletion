According to a family member, the noninstrument-rated private pilot was planning to refuel 
the airplane on the evening of the accident. After purchasing fuel, he subsequently departed in 
night instrument meteorological conditions, which included low clouds and mist. A witness 
heard the airplane flying overhead and then sounds associated with increased engine power, 
followed by a loud crash. The airplane impacted a heavily wooded area about 0.75 mile from 
the departure airport and was destroyed by impact forces and a postcrash fire. Examination of 
the airframe and engine did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation. Dark night instrument meteorological conditions can lead to spatial disorientation, 
particularly for a noninstrument-rated pilot. In addition, the wreckage distribution and the 
witness observation of increasing engine noise and the wreckage are consistent with the pilot 
losing control of the airplane due to spatial disorientation.
The pilot's toxicology results identified ethanol at 0.109% in muscle tissue and 0.039% in brain 
tissue. Although some of the ethanol may have been produced postmortem, it is likely that 
some was ingested before the accident. In addition, chlordiazepoxide (a prescription 
medication for the treatment of anxiety) and its metabolite, nordiazepam, were detected in the 
liver. It is likely the combined effects of chlordiazepoxide and ethanol significantly impaired 
the pilot's executive functioning, judgment, and decision-making, leading to his decision to fly 
in weather that he was unprepared to manage.
The noninstrument-rated pilot's improper decision to attempt visual flight in instrument 
meteorological conditions, which resulted in an in-flight loss of airplane control due to spatial 
disorientation. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's impaired decision-making due to 
the effects of ethanol and chlordiazepoxide.
