According to the pilot, he flew the traffic pattern to a touchdown zone landing on runway 
centerline. However, after touching down, the airplane "floated back up," then touched down 
again "with authority." It bounced again, then "weather vaned some," and the pilot became 
concerned that the airplane was "chewing up runway." The airplane then touched down a third 
time, but the pilot did not pull back on the yoke. He subsequently heard the propeller strike the 
runway, the airplane then veered off the right side of the runway, the nose landing gear 
collapsed, and the engine mounts broke. The pilot indicated that there were no preexisting 
mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Nearest recorded weather 
included winds that were about 90 degrees from the right of the runway, at 10, gusting to 15 
knots.
The pilot's improper recovery from a bounced landing during gusty crosswind conditions.
