The student pilot said he was on final approach for landing on runway 12 when he encountered 
a crosswind from the northeast. He corrected for the crosswind and proceeded to land. The 
airplane ballooned, touched down again and pulled to the right. The student pilot applied full 
power in an attempt to abort the landing. The airplane went off the right side of the runway, 
became airborne, and struck a large hay bale.
The student pilot's failure to initiate a go-around sooner, and his failure to maintain directional 
control.
