The pilot was landing a float-equipped airplane at a remote lake, during glassy water 
conditions. Glassy water landings usually consume a considerable landing area. The pilot 
stated that during the landing, the airplane touched down in the typical area as in previous 
landings; however, the airplane remained on the step (the float/hull is supported on top of the 
water surface as opposed to plowing through it) longer than usual and the floats subsequently 
impacted the shoreline. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. The pilot 
stated that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have 
precluded normal operation.
The pilot's inadequate landing technique that resulted in a landing area overrun. Contributing 
was the glassy water conditions.
