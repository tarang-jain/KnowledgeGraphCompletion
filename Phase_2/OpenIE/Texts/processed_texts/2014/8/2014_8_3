According to the FAA Certificated flight instructor, he was instructing the student rated pilot 
on a mountain flying technique known as "popping the flaps" in order to aid in gaining altitude 
during short field takeoffs. He stated that shortly after rotation, the student reached down to 
pop the flaps and inadvertently leaned on the yoke, causing the airplane to descend, strike the 
ground and loop to the right. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing spar.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical failures or anomalies with the airplane prior 
to or during the flight that would have prevented normal flight operation.
The student rated pilot's inadvertent flight control input resulting in a ground loop and 
substantial damage to the right wing.
