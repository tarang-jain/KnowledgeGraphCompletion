The pilot reported that while air-taxiing east about 15 feet above ground level (agl) to parking 
with adjoining buildings on both sides, which were known for buffeting winds that made it 
difficult to control the helicopter's yaw, he encountered a strong gust of wind. The helicopter 
abruptly yawed to the right and he input left pedal control which did not correct the right yaw. 
The helicopter continued rotating to the right at an increasing speed; full left pedal had no 
effect. The pilot stated that the helicopter subsequently completed several 360-degree turns to 
the right, which rendered it completely uncontrollable; he abruptly lowered the collective from 
about 8 to 10 feet agl to get the helicopter on the ground. During the descent the helicopter's 
left skid impacted the center of the taxiway, slid toward a fuel truck, and came to rest on its 
right side. The main rotor blade impacted a fuel truck's windshield. The helicopter sustained 
substantial damage to the tail boom and the upper and lower cabin/cockpit structure. The pilot 
reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter that would have 
precluded normal operation.
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the wind conditions and failure to maintain aircraft 
control during taxi, which resulted in a loss of tail rotor effectiveness and subsequent impact 
with the taxiway and a parked fuel truck.
