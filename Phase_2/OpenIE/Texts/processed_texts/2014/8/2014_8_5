According to the pilot, she was flying an instrument landing system approach when she noted 
that the glide slope was out of service. She transitioned to a localizer-only approach and 
continued. Night, instrument meteorological conditions prevailed with a 400-foot ceiling. She 
noticed that the airplane was "high and fast" on final approach, so she used speed brakes and 
flaps to slow the airplane and descend to the minimum descent altitude. As the airplane 
descended below the ceiling, she observed runway lights and attempted to land on the runway. 
The airplane landed long, departed the runway at the departure end, and struck an 
embankment before coming to rest. An inspector from the Federal Aviation Administration 
examined the airplane and confirmed substantial damage to the fuselage, wings, and 
empennage. The pilot reported no pre-impact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's failure to maintain a proper glide path and airspeed on final approach, which 
resulted in a long landing and runway excursion.
