According to a written statement provided by the pilot to a Federal Aviation Administration 
inspector, he performed a three-point landing in the tailwheel equipped airplane. The airplane 
"bounced two times," and then it veered to the right. According to a written statement from the 
passenger, the "approach was normal, [but the] problems started after touchdown." The 
airplane turned to the right, the pilot initiated a go around; however, the left wing rose up, and 
the airplane "lost control" to the right. The airplane came to rest in the grass on the right side 
of the runway, and incurred substantial damage to the firewall and fuselage. A postaccident 
examination of the airplane revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with 
the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's loss of directional control of the airplane during landing, which resulted in a runway 
excursion.
