The pilot reported he planned on making a wheel landing at a higher than normal airspeed due 
to the anticipated strong surface wind. The pilot reported that during the landing roll, after the 
tailwheel settled to the ground, he noticed that the wind velocity was less than he anticipated 
and that his ground speed was "pretty fast." According to the pilot, due to the increased 
groundspeed, the wings were still producing some lift and although the gear remained on the 
runway, the full weight of the airplane was not on the landing gear. The pilot stated the 
airplane swerved to the right and he was able to regain directional control. The airplane then 
swerved to the left and the pilot was not able to regain directional control which resulted in a 
ground loop. The tailwheel traveled into the grass alongside the runway, and the right wing and 
right stabilizer contacted the ground. The pilot was able to taxi the airplane back onto the 
runway, however; he stated it would not taxi straight. The pilot reported there were no 
mechanical malfunctions of the airplane prior to the accident. A postaccident examination 
revealed the airplane sustained substantial damage to the aft fuselage.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during the landing roll which 
resulted in the airplane ground looping.
