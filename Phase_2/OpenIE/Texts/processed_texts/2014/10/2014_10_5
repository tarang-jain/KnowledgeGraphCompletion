The flight instructor was conducting a biennial flight review for the private pilot\owner of the 
airplane. The private pilot departed from the 5,008-foot-long runway, performed a touch-and-
go landing without incident, and entered the traffic pattern for a simulated short-field landing. 
While on short final, the airplane struck a berm that was located just prior to runway and 
sustained substantial damage to the landing gear and right wing. The flight instructor stated 
that he realized that the airplane was low and expected the private pilot to add engine power; 
however, he did not attempt to manipulate the flight controls or provide any verbal 
instructions. The private pilot stated that he also realized that the airplane was low, but did not 
react prior to contact with the ground. Both pilots indicated that they did not experience any 
preaccident malfunctions or failures of the airplane that would have precluded normal 
operation. The private pilot reported about 600 hours of total flight experience, which included 
about 475 hours in the same make and model as the accident airplane. The flight instructor 
reported about 3,430 hours of total flight experience, which included about 200 hours in the 
same make and model as the accident airplane.
The private pilot's failure to maintain proper altitude and the flight instructor's failure to 
provide correction action, which resulted in a collision with terrain during landing.
