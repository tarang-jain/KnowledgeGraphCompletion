The pilot was performing an aerobatic flight at an airshow event when the accident occurred. 
The flight team manager witnessed the accident and reported that the airplane entered an 
intentional inverted flat spin at the apex of an inside loop maneuver. The airplane completed 
more than 3 rotations in the inverted flat spin before recovering into a dive. The team manager 
then saw the airplane pitch up and enter an "aggressive" left turn. A review of ground-based 
video footage confirmed the sequence of events reported by the team manager and showed 
that, after the pitch up and left roll, the airplane entered a nose-low, descending left spiral that 
continued to ground impact. The observed flight path was consistent with an accelerated 
aerodynamic stall after the pilot had recovered from the inverted spin at a low altitude. The 
airplane cockpit was equipped with an aft-facing video camera that captured the pilot and his 
flight control movements. A review of the available cockpit footage confirmed that the pilot 
remained conscious throughout the accident flight and that the ailerons, elevator, and engine 
had responded to his control inputs. Although the rudder was obstructed from view in the 
video by the pilot's helmeted head, his observed leg movements were consistent with expected 
rudder inputs throughout the flight. Further, a postaccident examination of the airplane did 
not reveal any mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's failure to maintain airplane control during the aerobatic flight, which resulted in the 
airplane exceeding its critical angle of attack and entering an accelerated stall at a low altitude.
