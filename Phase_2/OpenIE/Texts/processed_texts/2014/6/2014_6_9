The pilot/owner reported that he accompanied the chief pilot of the airplane kit manufacturer 
on operational ground and flight tests of the airplane following the installation of a rebuilt left 
propeller. The tests were "normal," and the chief pilot deplaned. The pilot then serviced the 
airplane with fuel and departed to perform three solo takeoffs and landings. On the third 
takeoff, the airplane pulled left and required hard right rudder to maintain runway alignment. 
When the airplane was about traffic pattern altitude, the pilot noted a 1,200-rpm difference 
between the left and right engines; the left engine was producing 1,400 rpm, and the right 
engine was producing 2,600 rpm. While flying the remainder of the traffic pattern, the pilot 
attempted to troubleshoot and get the rpm on the two engines to match until he was on final 
approach to the runway. The pilot reduced the engine power to idle as the airplane crossed the 
runway threshold, and the airplane "floated awhile" before touching down and subsequently 
bouncing again. The pilot stated that, during the second touchdown, the left wing lifted "due to 
the crosswind from the left" and that he had inadequate speed to control the airplane. The pilot 
chose to abort the landing after the second bounce when the airplane was at a 45-degree, nose-
high attitude. Both engines accelerated to full power, but the airplane collided with the runway, 
and both main landing gear and propellers were separated. Examination of the propeller 
assembly revealed no preimpact mechanical anomalies, and all noted damage was consistent 
with impact and overstress.
The pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a bounced landing. Also causal to the 
accident were the pilot's subsequent delayed decision to abort the landing and his improper 
execution of the aborted landing, which resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle-of-
attack and experiencing an aerodynamic stall.
