The student pilot completed three takeoffs and landing with the certified flight instructor (CFI) 
on board, then took off for his first solo flight in the pattern. During the first landing, the 
airplane bounced twice and on the third touchdown, the nose gear collapsed and the airplane 
slid to a stop.  The student pilot was not injured, but the airplane sustained substantial damage 
to the firewall. There were no reports of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with 
the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The student pilot's inadequate flare resulted in a hard landing.
