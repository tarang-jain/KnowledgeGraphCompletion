The pilot was landing a tailwheel-equipped airplane, at an off-airport site, which required a 
correction for an 8 knot, left quartering crosswind. During touchdown, the airplane bounced, 
and he attempted to recover, but the airplane drifted to the left. The pilot reported that he 
applied full engine power to abort the landing, but the airplane subsequently collided with a 
stand of alder trees at the end of the site, and nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial 
damage to the fuselage and left wing. The pilot reported there were no preaccident mechanical 
malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's inadequate recovery from a bounced landing, resulting in a runway excursion and 
collision with trees.
