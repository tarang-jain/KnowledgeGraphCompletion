The student pilot was practicing solo takeoff and landings in a tailwheel-equipped airplane on a 
dry, hard surfaced runway. At the beginning of the flight, the winds were light and variable, but 
during the last landing, the wind had shifted to a slight tailwind. During the landing, the pilot 
lost control of the airplane, and ground looped, sustaining substantial damage to the right 
wing. The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical anomalies with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's failure to recognize a wind shift, resulting in a tailwind landing, loss of control, and 
ground loop.
