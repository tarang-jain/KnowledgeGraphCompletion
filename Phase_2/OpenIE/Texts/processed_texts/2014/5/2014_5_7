The pilot reported that he decided to land at an en route airport to obtain fuel due to a stronger 
headwind than what was forecast for his route of flight. The pilot made a normal landing to the 
north and turned west off the runway onto the first taxi. He then made another turn to the 
north on the taxiway that paralleled the runway. As he taxied beyond a row of trees that were to 
the west, the upwind wing of the airplane lifted and the airplane flipped inverted. The rudder 
and left front wing strut were substantially damaged. The pilot stated he was using proper 
crosswind taxi technique, but was unable to keep the wing down. The wind conditions recorded 
at an airport located 37 miles away from the airport where the accident occurred were from 
290 degrees at 16 knots gusting to 25 knots. The pilot reported the local wind condition at the 
time of the accident was similar.
The pilot's inability to control the airplane while taxiing due to a strong crosswind condition.
