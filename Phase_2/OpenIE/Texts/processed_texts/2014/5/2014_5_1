According to the flight instructor, he gave the pilot under instruction (PUI) a simulated engine 
failure after takeoff when the helicopter reached approximately 50 knots. The PUI pulled the 
cyclic aft and increased collective. The flight instructor joined the PUI on the controls to 
prevent him from pulling too much collective and to lower the helicopter's nose to a level 
attitude. Both pilots were on the controls as the collective was increased to cushion the landing. 
The helicopter landed on the paved runway's centerline, and as it slid across what the pilots 
described as an uneven surface, it began to porpoise. The flight instructor lowered the 
collective to slow the slide and heard a noise, then the helicopter began vibrate and turned 220 
degrees to the right before coming to a stop. During the slide, a main rotor blade cut off the tail 
boom. Neither pilot reported any preexisting mechanical anomalies that would have precluded 
normal operation.
The flightcrew's improper recovery from a simulated engine failure after takeoff. Contributing 
to the accident was the flight instructor's failure to clarify who had control of the helicopter.
