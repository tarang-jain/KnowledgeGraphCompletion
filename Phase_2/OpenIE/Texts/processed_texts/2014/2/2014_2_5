According to the student pilot, this was his first solo flight and he was conducting touch-and-go 
landings and takeoffs. On the third landing, he flared the airplane high; it landed hard and 
bounced back into the air. He then pitched the nose of the airplane up and the tail section 
struck the runway prior to landing. The student pilot taxied the airplane off of the active 
runway and brought it to a full stop. A visual examination revealed minor damage to the 
exterior of the airplane. The student pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or 
failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. The airplane was 
examined by maintenance personnel for further damage and released back into service. The 
airplane was used during another flight, and flight controls were noted as difficult to 
manipulate.  The airplane was returned for further examination and during the second 
examination, substantial damage was noted to the firewall from the first event.
The student pilot's improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard landing.
