The pilot reported that the wind was calm during his descent to landing. He further stated that 
he was low and slow at about 150 to 200 feet above the ground when the airplane began to stall 
and he was too late to respond. The airplane subsequently collided with terrain and came to 
rest short of the runway threshold. During the accident sequence, the firewall and both wings 
sustained substantial damage. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or 
failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot's inadequate glide path and failure to maintain adequate airspeed during final 
approach, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
