The pilot returned to the airfield after a short cross-country flight. According to the pilot, he 
chose runway 36, and observed a slight crosswind off to the right. The pilot added that the 
tailwheel equipped airplane swerved left after touchdown, so he attempted a go-around 
maneuver; he closed the carburetor heat control and added full throttle. During the attempted 
go-around, the airplane's main landing gear remained in contact with the ground and the 
airplane exited the runway. The airplane then crossed between the runway and taxiway, 
impacted a snow berm, and came to rest inverted. Examination of the airplane revealed 
substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings. The pilot reported no mechanical 
anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.
