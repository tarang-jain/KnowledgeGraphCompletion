According to the pilot, while in the landing flare, the tailwheel-equipped airplane began to roll 
to the left. He applied right aileron to counteract the roll and provide wind correction; 
however, as the airplane decelerated during the landing roll, it lacked rudder authority to 
counteract a gust of wind from the right. The airplane ground looped 180 degrees to the right, 
and the left main landing gear collapsed, resulting in substantial damage to the outboard 
portion of the left wing and left horizontal stabilizer. The pilot reported no preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal 
operation. Recorded wind velocity at a nearby airport about the time of the accident was 15 
knots, with gusts to 25 knots.
The pilot's loss of control while landing the tailwheel-equipped airplane in gusting wind 
conditions, which resulted in a ground loop.
