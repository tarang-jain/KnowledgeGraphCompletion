The pilot stated that he was level cruise at 10,500 feet mean sea level, when he moved the fuel 
selector from the right tank to the left tank.  The airplane was equipped with the Beech fuel 
selector valve disengagement warning light kit.  The fuel selector is a combined fuel pump and 
valve assembly. The handle can be lifted up and down to pump fuel, but in this condition it is 
not engaged with the selector valve portion of the assembly. When the fuel selector handle and 
the fuel valve do not agree, the red 'fuel' light illuminates.
When the pilot selected the left tank the red 'fuel' light illuminated. He cross checked the fuel 
flow and fuel pressure, both of which were in the normal range. A few minutes later he entered 
an en-route descent, when the engine began to lose power. He pumped the fuel pump, the red 
'fuel' light remained ON, and the engine did not regain power.  The pilot executed a forced 
landing onto a road and damaged the left wing during the landing roll.  A post accident 
examination of the airplane was performed by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector and 
a technical representative from the airplane manufacturer. The fuel selector valve was found to 
operate as designed. The red 'fuel' light illuminated when the fuel selector handle was not 
engaged with the valve and aligned with the fuel tank that provides fuel to the engine. 
Additionally, the engine was test run and found to operate normally.
Loss of engine power due to fuel starvation as a result of the pilot's failure to properly operate 
the fuel selector valve.
