The certificated private pilot reported that while in cruise flight at 1,000 feet msl, all engine 
power was lost.  He stated that all attempts to restore engine power failed, forcing him to select 
an open swampy meadow as an emergency landing area.  During the ensuing landing roll, the 
airplane's main landing gear contacted soft tundra, and the airplane nosed over.  The airplane 
sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage and tail.  The NTSB investigator-in-charge 
did not have access to the airplane or engine after recovery, and was unable to perform a 
postaccident inspection. 
A loss of engine power due to an undetermined reason.  A factor associated with the accident 
was unsuitable terrain for a forced landing.

was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) local area personal flight under Title 14, CFR 
Part 91, when the accident occurred.  The certificated private pilot, and the one passenger
