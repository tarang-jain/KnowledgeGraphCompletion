The pilot of the other airplane was taxiing for departure on a north-south taxiway for a 
departure from runway 18R.  He reported that the ATIS advised all traffic to watch the flagmen 
for ATC instructions.  The pilot reported that he was watching the flagman as instructed.  The 
pilot reported, 'The flagman gave me a signal to stop as I approached the intersection, and then 
changed to the right turn signal.  I started my right turn.  The flagman gave me no indication 
that there was an aircraft in my path, or that I should do anything other than complete the 
turn.'  He reported that he was about halfway through the turn when his propeller struck the 
right wingtip of the RV-6.  He reported, 'I was confident that this area was clear because the 
flagman, with a clear view, directed me to make the turn.'  The pilot of the RV-6 was not aware 
of the conflict until the Cessna's propeller hit the right wing and aileron of his airplane. 
the pilot of the other airplane did not maintain proper clearance.
