During the landing roll on a snow covered landing strip, the airplane's skis began to track in a 
snow machine rut, pulling the airplane to the left.  The pilot applied power and full right 
rudder, but the airplane continued left, striking trees on the edge of the 1,200-foot-long by 12-
foot-wide landing strip. 
The pilot's selection of unsuitable terrain for landing.  A factor was the snow machine ruts 
creating a rough landing surface. 
 On March 3, 1998, at 1700 Alaska standard time, a ski equipped Cessna 180H airplane, 
N4751U, sustained substantial damage when its left wing impacted trees during landing roll at 
the Tatitna landing strip, Tatitna, Alaska.  The commercial certificated pilot and the one 
passenger aboard were not injured.  The flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91 as a 
personal flight from Rainbow Lake in Big Lake, Alaska, to Tatitna.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and a VFR flight plan was filed.
The pilot stated to the NTSB investigator that during his landing roll, the airplane's skis 
encountered a snow machine rut, and began to track to the left.  The pilot said he applied 
power and full right rudder, but the left wing contacted willow trees on the side of the 1,200 
feet long by 12 feet wide, snow covered landing strip.
