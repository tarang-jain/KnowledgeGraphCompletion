The pilot reported that during the takeoff roll he noticed the airplane was not accelerating 
normally.  He reported that he checked the manifold pressure and RPM's, and that the RPM's 
were low.  He checked the propeller control at full forward.  The pilot reported that he veered 
to the right to avoid a highway at the end of the runway.  The airplane went through a fence 
and into a pasture, breaking the left landing gear as it slid to a stop.  The airplane was 
inspected.  The engine was started and run to approximately 1,800 RPM and the operation 
appeared normal.  A small amount of water was drained from the right fuel cell. 
the pilot failed to abort the takeoff in a timely manner and could not stop  on the runway. 
 On April 3, 1998, at 0910 central standard time, an Air Tractor AT-401, N1008T, operated by 
Kroeplin Ag Service, was substantially damaged when the airplane veered off the runway 
during the takeoff roll and went through a ditch.  The commercial pilot was not injured.  The 
CFR Part 137 flight was departing a grass airstrip near Highmore, South Dakota, on a local 
flight.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed.
