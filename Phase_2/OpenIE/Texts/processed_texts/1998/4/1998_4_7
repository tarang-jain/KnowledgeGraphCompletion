The airplane was on a stabilized approach at 50 feet AGL (Above Ground Level), with full flaps 
and indicating 70 knots, when the airplane developed a high sink rate.  At 30 feet, the pilot 
tried to arrest the excessive rate of descent with power.  The airplane struck a drop off on the 
approach end of Runway 24, shearing the landing gear before coming to rest upright 40 feet 
down the runway. 
The pilot's failure to obtain the proper touchdown point. 
 On April 2, 1998, at 1915 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-28-180, N44181, was substantially 
damaged while landing to Warren Airpark, Warren, Pennsylvania.  The certificated private 
pilot received serious injuries and two passengers sustained minor injuries.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight that originated from Tappahannock, 
Virginia, approximately 1835.  No flight plan was filed for the flight conducted under 14 CFR 
Part 91.
The pilot stated he did not experience any mechanical problems with the airplane.  He also 
stated the airplane was on a stabilized approach at 50 feet, with full flaps and indicating 70 
knots, when the airplane developed a "high sink rate."  At 30 feet, the pilot tried to arrest the 
excessive rate of descent with power.  The airplane struck a drop off on the approach end of 
Runway 24, shearing the landing gear before coming to rest upright 40 feet down the runway.
A Federal Aviation Administration Inspector described the 15 foot drop, located 100 feet short 
of the landing threshold, as vertical.
