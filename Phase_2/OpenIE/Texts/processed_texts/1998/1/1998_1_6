 On January 2, 1998, about 1415 eastern standard time, a Cessna 172P, N9912L, was 
substantially damaged as it collided with a parked vehicle while taxiing at the Augusta State 
Airport, Augusta, Maine.  The certificated private pilot and the pilot rated passenger were not 
injured.  Visual meteorological conditions existed and no flight plan was file for the ferry flight 
conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.  The airplane, registered to the Civil Air Patrol (CAP), 
Maxwell AFB, Alabama, departed the Northern Maine Regional/Presque Isle Airport, Presque 
Isle, Maine, at 1230.
The pilot reported that it snowed the previous day, and residual snow and ice were obstructing 
the taxiway lines.  The pilot recalled that as he was taxiing, he used a row of hangars to his right 
to assist in judging the distance from parked airplanes on his left.  Focusing their attention 
right and left, both the pilot and the passenger stated that they did not notice the vehicle 
parked in front of the hangars.  The pilot applied the brakes, and the airplane impacted the 
vehicle with the right wing.
The Federal Aviation Administration Inspectors examined the airplane on January 7, 1998.  
The examination revealed damage to the right wing spar, and upgraded this incident to an 
accident.  No mechanical malfunctions were found with the airplane.
