The pilot was performing a wheel landing on runway 27 (5,500 ft. x 75 ft., elevation 7,171 feet) 
which is located on top a mesa with trees lining the south side.  He stated that he requested an 
airport advisory which gave the wind at S-SE for 10 knots with gusts to 20 knots.  When the 
airplane touched down, it began to 'weathervane,' and it exited the runway to the left striking a 
ditch and fence.  The density altitude was 10,459 feet, at the time of the accident. 
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the wind conditions.  Contributing factors were the 
crosswinds, the fence, and the ditch.
