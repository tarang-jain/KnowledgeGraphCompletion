The airplane was on approach to the 1,863 foot long, asphalt runway.  The pilot stated, 'Just 
before the final flare a hornet distracted me to the extent I lost concentration to the task of 
landing.  I touched down 'long.'  Seeing only a short area in which to stop, I applied full power 
to go around, but there was not enough room before the reeds in the swampy area.'  The 
airplane struck the reeds and nosed over.  Examination of the wreckage did not reveal any 
mechanical malfunctions of the airframe or engine.  Wind reported at airports about 15 miles 
west, and 23 miles east of the accident site at 1345, were from 330 degrees at 15 knots, with 20 
knot gusts, and from 350 degrees at 10 knots, respectively. 
The pilot's improper in-flight decision to continue the landing and his delayed go-around 
attempt.  A factor in this accident was the pilot's diverted attention. 
 On June 1, 1998, about 1415 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 140, N72657, was 
substantially damaged during landing at the Griswold Airport (N04), Madison, Connecticut.  
The certificated private pilot and passenger were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and no flight plan had been filed for the flight that departed Skylark Airpark Airport, 
Warehouse, Connecticut, about 1330, destined for N04.  The personal flight was conducted 
under 14 CFR Part 91.
The airplane was on approach to runway 06, a 1,863 foot long, asphalt runway.  In a 
written statement, the pilot said: 
" Just before final flare for landing a hornet distracted me to the extent I lost concentration to 
the task of landing.  I touched down 'long.'  Seeing only a short area in which to stop, I applied 
full power to go around, but there was not enough room before the reeds in the swampy area...I 
was carrying a little extra speed on final because the wind was switching about 90 degrees from 
time to time...."
The airplane struck the reeds, and nosed over.
Examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration Inspector did not 
reveal evidence of a pre-impact malfunction of the airframe or engine.
Wind reported at airports about 15 miles west, and 23 miles east of the accident site at 
1345, were from 330 degrees at 15 knots, with 20 knot gusts, and from 350 degrees at 10 knots, 
respectively.
