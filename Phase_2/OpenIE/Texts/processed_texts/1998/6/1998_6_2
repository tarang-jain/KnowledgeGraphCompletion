After takeoff the airplane departed controlled flight and impacted the terrain.  The pilot said 
that he believes that the airplane encountered a wind shift.  The airplane departed on runway 
31.  The reported winds six minutes prior to the accident were 270 degrees at 23 knots with 
gusts to 27 knots. 
the pilot's misjudged wind conditions and his not obtaining/maintaining compensation for 
wind conditions.  A factor was a sudden wind shift. 
 On June 1, 1998, at 1700 central daylight time, a Cessna 175A, N6847E, operated by a private 
pilot descended into the terrain after liftoff from runway 31 (5,160' x 100' dry/asphalt) at Karl 
Stefan Memorial Airport, near Norfolk, Nebraska.  The airplane was destroyed on impact with 
the terrain and a post accident fire.  The pilot and two passengers reported minor injuries.  The 
pilot stated that the airplane may have encountered windshear and was unable to climb.  The 
personal 14 CFR Part 91 flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions.  No flight 
plan was on file.  The flight was originating at the time of the accident.
The pilot said that the airplane lifted off at about 65 knots.  He said that when the airplane 
reached an altitude of about 200 to 300 feet, the airplane began to descend and he was unable 
to get the airplane to maintain flight.  He said, "I believe the sole cause of the accident to be a 
change in wind direction and/or velocity, complicated by large groves of trees to the west of the 
runway ... ."  He said that there was no mechanical failure or loss of power in the airplane.  He 
said that just prior to impact he extended the flaps to full.
The departure was on runway 31.  The winds recorded at the departure airport six minutes 
prior to the accident were 270 degrees at 23 knots with gusts to 27 knots.
