 On February 1, 1997, at 1635 eastern standard time, a Cessna 150G, N4655X, sustained 
substantial damage during a nose over during takeoff on runway 27 (4700' x 100' dry/asphalt) 
at Dowagiac, Michigan.  The solo student pilot was conducting touch and go landings when the 
airplane exited the runway to the left and impacted a snowbank.  The pilot reported no injuries.  
The local 14 CFR Part 91 flight was operating in visual meteorological conditions.  No flight 
plan was on file.  The flight originated about 1510.
The student pilot said that during the transition from a landing to takeoff, the airplane "veered" 
left.  He said he then attempted a "soft field" takeoff, in an attempt to get the airplane airborne; 
however, the landing gear contacted a snowbank and the airplane nosed over.
