On the first flight following maintenance to the nose landing gear because of a ground incident, 
the nose gear failed to extend.  The pilot elected to raise all the landing gear and land gear up.  
Inspection following the accident revealed the nose landing gear doors to be improperly 
adjusted preventing the nose landing gear from extending. 
Improper repair to the nose landing gear assembly.  A factor was binding of the nose gear 
extension assembly due to the improper repair. 
 On March 1, 1997, at 1155 mountain standard time, a Cessna TR182, N2396S, sustained 
substantial damage when the nose gear failed to extend for landing at Pueblo Municipal 
Airport, Pueblo, Colorado.  The private pilot and passenger were not injured on this personal 
flight operating under 14 CFR Part 91.  No flight plan was filed and visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed.  The flight departed Alamosa, Colorado, at 1115.
This was the first flight after repairing the nose landing gear following a ground incident which 
occurred on February 21, 1997.  The flight departed Alamosa with the pilot occupying the left 
seat and his 2 year old daughter in a car seat strapped in the right seat.  On arrival in Pueblo, 
the nose gear failed to extend.  After attempts to lower the gear failed, the pilot elected to raise 
the landing gear and landed with all the landing gear in the up position.
Examination of the aircraft by a certified repair station following the accident revealed the nose 
gear doors were not properly adjusted when maintenance was performed on the landing gear 
following the previous incident.  The lack of proper adjustment prevented the nose landing 
gear from extending.  Aircraft damage was to the left wing and underside of the fuselage in the 
area of the nose landing gear assembly.
