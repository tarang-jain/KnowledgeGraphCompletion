After about 15 minutes on a 'Hare and Hound' flight, the pilot noticed a drop in fuel pressure 
(while flying at a low altitude). He switched fuel tanks, but the balloon had begun to descend. 
The pilot attempted to stop the descent by using a good tank, but the balloon continued to lose 
altitude and landed hard on flat terrain, before the descent could be stopped. The pilot and 
other pilots reported low level wind shear in the area at the time. No mechanical malfunction 
was reported. 
the pilot's inadequate in-flight planning, which resulted in an excessive descent and 
subsequent hard landing, due to a drop in fuel pressure along with shifting winds at low 
altitude. 
 On March 1, 1997, at 0815 hours mountain standard time, a Balloon Works AX-8B, N9033H, 
owned and operated by the pilot, collided with the ground near Parker, Arizona, during a local 
pleasure flight.  The balloon was not damaged and the pilot and one of two passengers onboard 
were not injured.  The other passenger received a serious injury to the ankle.  Visual 
meteorological conditions existed at the time.
According to the pilot, after 15 minutes of flight, he noticed a drop in fuel pressure and 
switched to another tank with the balloon making a corresponding drop in altitude and change 
in direction.  A continuous application of the burner blast valve did not stop the rate of descent 
and a hard landing occurred.
The pilot stated that the loss of the propane fuel pressure in the number 2 tank just prior to the 
changeover to the number 4 tank, along with a wind shear, caused the balloon to collide with 
the ground.  Wind shears were reported by several balloonists upon debriefing their flights 
later that morning.  The pilot operator report did not indicate a mechanical malfunction or 
failure.
