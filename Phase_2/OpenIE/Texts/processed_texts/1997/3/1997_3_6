While in cruise flight the pilot felt a slight vibration and immediately made a power change 
without affect.  After reducing the engine rpm from 2300 to 2100, the airplane vibrated hard 
for a split second and then smoothed out.  At that point, the propeller had separated from the 
engine with part of the crankshaft.  Metallurgical examination of the crankshaft revealed that 
the fatigue failure occurred inside the crankshaft bore 1.7 inches forward of the crankshaft oil 
seal.  The point of origin was at two corrosion pits. 
failure of the crankshaft due to improper inspection/overhaul procedures. 
 On March 2, 1997, about 1750 hours mountain standard time, a Beech J35, N39W, was 
substantially damaged during a forced landing at Morristown, Arizona.  The pilot received 
minor injuries and the passenger received serious injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed for the personal cross-country flight and no flight plan was filed. 
The pilot reported that while in cruise flight he felt a vibration and immediately made a power 
change without affect.  He further reduced the engine rpm from 2,300 to 2,100, the airplane 
vibrated hard for a split second and then smoothed out.  At that point, the propeller separated 
from the engine with part of the crankshaft.  The failure occurred over remote desert terrain 
and the propeller was not recovered.
ENGINE INFORMATION
According to the engine logbook, the engine had been overhauled on April 11, 1989, at 1,819 
total hours.  At the time of the accident, the engine had accumulated about 937 hours since the 
overhaul. 
Postaccident metallurgical examination of the crankshaft revealed that it had failed 
approximately 1.7 inches forward of the crankshaft oil seal.  From this fatigue cracking origin, it 
propagated at a 45-degree angle to the axis of the crankshaft forward and aft.  The origin was 
located inside the crankshaft bore at two corrosion pits.
