During a landing, the glider collided with high vegetation on the left side of the runway after 
the student pilot allowed it to touchdown left of the runway centerline. The left wing tip 
dragged in the vegetation, and the glider ground looped to the left. The instructor stated that 
he was overconfident in the student's ability and did not anticipate his actions. The runway was 
4,000 feet long and 75 feet wide. The wing span of the glider was about 57 feet.  
failure of the student pilot to maintain proper runway alignment and wing tip clearance from 
high vegetation beside the runway during landing, and the flight instructor's inadequate 
supervision of the flight.  High vegetation on the runway shoulder was a related factor. 
 On May 2, 1997, at 1410 hours mountain standard time, a Grob 103A glider, N931BG, collided 
with vegetation after the pilot under training landed left of the runway 23C centerline at the 
Pleasant Valley Airport, Peoria, Arizona.  The glider was substantially damaged.  The certified 
flight instructor and certificated commercial pilot student were not injured.  The glider was 
being operated as an instructional flight by Baboquivari Soaring School, d.b.a. Turf Soaring 
School, Peoria.  The local flight originated from the Pleasant Valley Airport at 1320.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time.
According to the flight instructor, the student pilot landed the glider on the left side of the 
runway.  The left wing tip dragged in high vegetation and the glider ground looped to the left.  
The instructor also stated he was overconfident in the pilot's ability and did not anticipate the 
pilot's actions.
The runway was 4,000 feet long and 75 feet wide.  The wing span of the glider is about 57 feet 
(17.5 meters) wide.
