The pilot reported that during landing, a gust of wind caught the airplane, and it bounced. He 
added power to smooth out the landing, but it bounced once again. He then added full power in 
an attempt to go-around, but he noticed the engine was vibrating from the propeller having 
struck the runway. He reduced the power to idle, and then the airplane descended and 
contacted the terrain off the right side of the runway. 
the pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions, and his improper recovery from a 
bounced landing, which resulted in an improper flare and hard landing.  The gusty wind was a 
related factor. 
 On August 1, 1997, at 1320 central daylight time (cdt), a Young RV-4, N654Y, operated by a 
commercial pilot collided with the terrain while landing on runway 19 (4,295' x 100') at the 
Fort McCoy Airport, Sparta, Wisconsin.  The 14 CFR Part 91 flight was operating in visual 
meteorological conditions without a flight plan.  The airplane was substantially damaged.  The 
pilot and passenger were not injured.  The flight originated from Yankton, South Dakota, at 
approximately 1100 cdt.
The pilot reported he was intending to land at Sparta for fuel while en route to Oshkosh.  He 
reported that he chose to make a wheel landing since the wind was greater than 10 knots and 
not directly down the runway.  The pilot continued to report that upon landing, a gust of wind 
was encountered and the airplane bounced.  He applied power, but the airplane bounced one 
more time.  He reported he then added full power to perform a go- around but the engine was 
vibrating from the propeller having struck the runway.  He reported, "I immediately went to 
idle power and attempted to lower the nose but suspect I stalled."  The airplane descended and 
impacted the terrain off the right side of the runway.
