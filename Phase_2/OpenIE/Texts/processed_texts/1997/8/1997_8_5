land.  He continued to report, "Flared at correct position, cut throttle glided down runway 25 
touchdown normal."  The pilot reported that after a ground roll of 100 to 175 feet the airplane 
"veered to right instantly & ended up on left wingtip with left gear collapsed 1/2 in grass on 
right side of 25."  The pilot reported that he had not used the brakes during the landing roll;
