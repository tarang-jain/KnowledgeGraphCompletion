The pilot was departing from an 800-foot-long beach site at dusk.  During lift-off at less than 
flying speed the airplane dragged a wingtip and subsequently settled into the water. 
The pilot's selection of an unsuitable off-airport site for takeoff, and his premature lift-off. 
 On August 1, 1997, about 2200 Alaska daylight time, a Cessna 170B tail wheel equipped 
airplane, N3491C, sustained substantial damage when it impacted water during an attempted 
takeoff from a beach on Seymour Canal, about 22 miles southeast of Juneau, Alaska, at 
position 58-00.0 north latitude, 134-20.0 west longitude.  The private certificated pilot was 
uninjured.  The flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91 in visual meteorological conditions 
as a personal flight.  Lighting conditions were evening twilight.
The pilot stated to the NTSB investigator that he began his takeoff from hard, wet sand with an 
estimated 800 feet of takeoff length available.  When he saw the water become visible in the 
landing light, he applied flaps to become airborne, but did not have sufficient airspeed to fly.  
The airplane's right wing contacted the water, and the airplane came to rest approximately 200 
feet from the shoreline, in approximately three feet of water.  The pilot waded to shore, and 
was picked up by a passing aircraft about 1000 on August 2, 1997.
The pilot stated that he weighs 180 pounds, and that there was 90 pounds of fuel on board.  
The passenger seats had all been removed, and there was a thirty pound pack and a ten pound 
rifle on board.
