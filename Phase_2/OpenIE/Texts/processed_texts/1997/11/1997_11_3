All engine power was suddenly lost while cruising over mountainous terrain in the pilot's 
experimental airplane.  The pilot made a forced landing on a soft, brush-covered field, and 
during rollout the airplane nosed over.  The pilot indicated that the power loss resulted from 
the engine's mixture control cable breaking due to fatigue at its carburetor attachment fitting.  
The component had a total time in service of 114 hours. 
Fuel starvation due to a fatigue fractured mixture control cable.  Contributing factors were the 
soft, brush-covered emergency landing field. 
 On November 1, 1997, at 0930 hours Pacific standard time, an experimental Rodgers/Gaust 
RV-6, N44JR, owned and operated by the pilot, was substantially damaged during a forced 
landing near Wellington, Nevada.  Neither the private pilot nor the passenger was injured.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed during the personal flight, and no flight plan was 
filed.  The flight originated from Bishop, California, at 0830.
According to the pilot, engine power was suddenly lost while cruising over mountainous terrain 
en route to Carson City, Nevada.  The pilot made a forced landing in a soft dirt field which was 
covered with sagebrush.  During rollout the airplane nosed over.
The pilot reported that the airplane had a total engine and airframe time of 114 hours.  In the 
pilot's completed report, he indicated that the loss of engine power resulted from the engine's 
mixture control cable breaking at its carburetor attachment fitting.  The pilot verbally reported 
that he believed the cable broke due to fatigue.
