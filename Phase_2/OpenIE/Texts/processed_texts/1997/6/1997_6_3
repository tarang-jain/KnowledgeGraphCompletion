N115AL, a Bell 206B helicopter, and N2773A, a Bell 206L-1 helicopter, collided in midair 
approximately 3 nm west of Intracoastal City, Louisiana.  N2773A was in cruise flight, 
transiting through the Intracoastal City traffic advisory area from northeast to southwest.  
N115AL departed Intracoastal City westbound.  Radar data indicated that the angle between 
the flight paths was about 60 degrees.  The pilot of N115AL reported that he had just leveled 
out at 700 feet agl when he saw N2773A to his right at a 'slightly' lower altitude and banked 
hard left.  A witness and physical evidence indicated that the main rotor blades of N115AL 
struck the tail rotor of N2773A.  N2773A was not observed to take evasive action.  
Subsequently, N2773A impacted the ground in an uncontrolled descent, and N115AL made a 
forced landing in a slough and sank.  Prior to departure, the pilot of N115AL communicated his 
intentions on the local traffic advisory frequency.  There were no radio communications from 
N2773A on the advisory frequency, and the operator of N2773A did not include the use of 
traffic advisory services as a company standard operating procedure in its operations manual. 
The failure of both pilots to see and avoid each other's aircraft.  Factors were the failure of the 
pilot of N2773A to use the available traffic advisory service and the failure of the operator of 
N2773A to make the use of traffic advisory services a company standard operating procedure. 
 HISTORY OF THE FLIGHTS
On June 1, 1997, approximately 1125 central daylight time, a midair collision occurred between 
N115AL, a Bell 206B helicopter, registered to and operated by Offshore Logistics, Inc., doing 
business as Air Logistics, and N2773A, a Bell 206L-1 helicopter, registered to and operated by 
Houston Helicopters, Inc., approximately 3 nautical miles west of Intracoastal City, Louisiana.  
N115AL sustained substantial damage, and N2773A was destroyed.  The commercial pilot of 
N115AL sustained minor injuries, and the commercial pilot of N2773A was fatally injured.  
There were no passengers in either helicopter.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for 
the Title 14 CFR Part 91 positioning flights and company VFR flight plans were filed by both 
pilots.  N115AL departed the Air Logistics Heliport at Intracoastal City and was en route to 
Grand Chenier, Louisiana.  N2773A departed from the Abbeville Municipal Airport in 
Abbeville, Louisiana, and was en route to an offshore oil platform in East Cameron Block 109.
During an interview conducted by the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC), the pilot of N115AL 
reported that he departed Intracoastal City at 1120 westbound towards Grand Chenier.  He 
climbed to 700 feet agl, leveled off, set cruise power, and scanned the instruments.  The pilot 
then saw "the nose and left side of a red helicopter" to his right and at a "slightly lower 
altitude."  He rolled his helicopter to the left and was in a "40 to 45 degree" left bank when he 
felt the impact.  The pilot's next recollection was that his helicopter was in a descent on an 
easterly heading and "shaking violently."  His helicopter touched down in the water, rolled over 
and sank.  He was able to free himself from the helicopter and swim to the surface where he 
was picked up by a man in a boat.
Three witnesses to the collision reported conflicting information concerning the flight paths of 
the two helicopters.  During an interview conducted by the IIC and in a written statement, the 
witness who picked up the pilot of N115AL reported that he was westbound in his boat in the 
slough north of the Leland Bowman Lock when he observed a red helicopter (N2773A) 
overhead and to his right traveling "roughly westbound."  The red helicopter "appeared to be 
climbing slowly."  He then noticed a second blue helicopter (N115AL) "slightly north of and 
slightly higher than the first" helicopter;  the blue helicopter was also traveling westbound "but 
on a course heading that would intersect the red helicopter."  
According to the witness, the pilot of the blue helicopter attempted to avoid the collision "by 
pitching the aircraft up and simultaneously banking to the right very steeply."  The witness 
then observed the main rotor blades of the blue helicopter impact the tail rotor of the red 
helicopter.  The red helicopter's tail rotor shattered "with visible debris and a loud explosion," 
and the tailboom "folded downward and separated from the fuselage."  The red helicopter 
"pitched over fully inverted" and impacted in the trees on the north bank of the slough.
Following the collision, the witness observed that the blue helicopter had leveled out facing 
south and "appeared to be translating, or moving sideways," to the right while "yawing to the 
left."   It moved out over the water and descended "rapidly in a controlled manner to land in 
the water."  As the blue helicopter passed his boat, the witness "observed it shuddering 
violently and small pieces of debris falling off."
Two crewmen on a tugboat that had "just" passed through the Leland Bowman Lock eastbound 
also witnessed the midair collision and were interviewed by telephone and provided written 
statements to the IIC.  One of the crewmen stated that the red helicopter (N2773A) was 
westbound and the blue helicopter (N115AL) was eastbound.  The other crewman stated that 
the red helicopter was westbound and the blue helicopter was southbound.  Both crewmen 
reported that immediately prior to the collision, the nose of the blue helicopter went up "like it 
was trying to stop." 
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
The pilot of N115AL held a commercial pilot certificate with helicopter, single and multiengine 
land airplane, and instrument ratings.  He successfully completed the competency check 
required by Title 14 CFR Part 135.293(b) in a Bell 206L-1 helicopter on April 14, 1997.  
According to FAA records, he held a first class medical certificate dated July 18, 1996, with the 
restriction, "must wear corrective lenses."  The pilot reported that he was wearing prescription 
sunglasses at the time of the collision.  He had a total flight time of 2,345 hours of which 1,395 
hours were in helicopters.
The pilot of N2773A held a commercial pilot certificate with helicopter, single and multiengine 
land airplane, and instrument ratings.  He successfully completed the competency check 
required by Part 135.293(b) in a Bell 206B helicopter on February 20, 1997.  According to FAA 
records, he held a first class medical certificate dated March 3, 1997, with the restriction, "must 
wear corrective lenses."  It could not be determined if the pilot was wearing his glasses at the 
time of the collision.  He had a total flight time of approximately 11,000 hours.  
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
N115AL, a Bell 206B, was manufactured in April of 1978.  At the time of the accident, the 
helicopter had accumulated 18,943 hours of flight time.  It was painted blue with white trim 
markings and had an anti-collision light installed on the top of the vertical fin and two landing 
lights, one facing down and one facing forward, installed in the nose.  During examination of 
the wreckage, the switch for the anti-collision light was found in the "ON" position, and the 
switch for the landing lights was found in the "BOTH" position.
N2773A, a Bell 206L-1, was manufactured in August of 1979.  At the time of the accident, the 
helicopter had accumulated 7,310 hours of flight time.  It was painted red with white and black 
trim markings and had an anti-collision light installed on the top of the vertical fin and two 
landing lights, one facing down and one facing forward, installed in the nose.  During 
examination of the wreckage, the light switch positions could not be determined due to the 
extent of impact damage.
METEROLOGICAL INFORMATION
At 1150, the reported weather conditions at Intracoastal City were wind from 330 degrees at 5 
knots, visibility 7 statute miles, scattered clouds at 4,000 feet, temperature 77 degrees 
Fahrenheit, dewpoint 57 degrees Fahrenheit, and altimeter setting 29.90 inches of Hg.
At the time of the accident, the position of the sun at Abbeville, Louisiana, located 
approximately 12 nautical miles north northeast of the accident site, was 103 degrees (true) in 
azimuth and 66 degrees in elevation.  
COMMUNICATIONS
During examination of the wreckage of N115AL, the digital display of the single 
communications radio, a King KY-196A, precluded determination of the frequency selected.  
Review of Air Logistics's radio log for June 1, 1997, indicated that the pilot of N115AL reported 
departing Intracoastal City en route to Grand Chenier at 1118. 
Examination of the wreckage of N2773A revealed that the helicopter's single communications 
radio, a King KX170B, was tuned to a frequency of 129.45.  The Director of Operations of 
Houston Helicopters stated that 129.45 was a company frequency used for flight following.  A 
review of Houston Helicopters's radio log for June 1, 1997, indicated that the pilot of N2773A 
reported departing Abbeville en route to East Cameron 109 at 1119.
The accident occurred approximately 3 nautical miles west of the Petroleum Helicopters 
Heliport in Intracoastal City.  Petroleum Helicopters (PHI) operates a radio base station at this 
heliport with a frequency of 122.85.  The station provides local (within 10 nautical miles of the 
heliport) traffic advisories to participating VFR aircraft.  
According to information provided by PHI, the Intracoastal City traffic advisory area is one of 
eleven such advisory areas established at onshore high density helicopter traffic locations 
around the Gulf of Mexico by the Helicopter Safety Advisory Conference (HSAC).  HSAC was 
formed in 1978 "to promote safe procedures in the operation of rotary-winged aircraft," and its 
voting membership is comprised of companies that have "direct operating involvement in 
helicopter operations in the Gulf of Mexico."  The HSAC recommended practice for operations 
in the Intracoastal City area states, in part:
Outbound traffic will:
a.When departing a heliport within the 5 NM circle will call  prior to 
taking off, and wait a few seconds for the traffic advisory (or another aircraft) to 
respond with any conflicting traffic, before beginning a takeoff.
b.Execute an expeditious climb between 700 ft. and 1000 ft. after takeoff.
c.Maintain 700 ft. to 1000 ft. until 5 NM from the Reference Point [PHI heliport].
d.Climb to desired cruise altitude after reaching 5 NM from the 
Reference Point.
e.Call "Clear of the area" 10 NM from the Reference Point including 
altitude.
Local Traffic:
Traffic passing through the traffic advisory area will do so at 1200 ft. or above.  
Between the altitudes of 1200 and 3000 ft., pilots will:
a.Call at 10 NM from the Reference Point, giving altitude and route of 
flight as they enter the area.
b.Call "Clear of the area" at 10 NM from the Reference Point as they 
leave the area.
The landing light will be ON during operations within 10 NM of the Reference Point.
Do not overfly any heliport below 500 ft.
On the NOAA U.S. Gulf Coast VFR Aeronautical Chart issued on November 7, 1996, and valid 
on the date of the accident, the area within 10 nautical miles of Intracoastal City was identified 
with blue shading as a High Density Helicopter Activity Area, and 122.85 was listed as the 
radio frequency for this area.  On the NOAA Houston Sectional Aeronautical Chart issued on 
March 27, 1997, and valid on the date of the accident, a box containing the following text was 
placed approximately 4 inches below Intracoastal City.
EXTENSIVE HELICOPTER ACTIVITY WITHIN 10 NM OF THESE AREAS 
MONITOR INDICATED FREQUENCIES. MORGAN CITY, LA 123.05 
INTRACOASTAL CITY, LA 122.85
According to the pilot of N115AL, prior to takeoff, he filed a flight plan on company frequency, 
then switched to 122.85 and made the following announcement:  "taking off to the west, 
proceeding westbound."  He received a response from the PHI radio operator which he recalled 
as "no conflicting traffic."  He stated that the only traffic he heard on the frequency was a PHI 
helicopter repositioning at the PHI heliport.  Review of the June 1, 1997, radio log maintained 
by Petroleum Helicopters for their Intracoastal City base revealed an entry indicating a call was 
received from N115AL at 1120.  No record of a call being received from N2773A was found in 
the PHI radio log.
Both Air Logistics and Houston Helicopters held certificates issued by the FAA authorizing 
them to conduct on-demand air taxi operations in accordance with Title 14 CFR Part 135.  A 
copy of the operations manual required by Title 14 CFR Part 135.21 was obtained from each 
operator and reviewed by the IIC.  The section in the Air Logistics Operations Manual entitled 
"Advisory Area Operations (Outbound)" stated:
A.When departing a heliport within 5 NM of the reference point make 
an advisory call prior to beginning a takeoff.
B.Execute an expeditious climb to between 700 and 1000 feet after takeoff.
C.Maintain 700 to 1000 feet until 5 NM from the reference point.
D.Climb to desired cruise altitude after 5 NM from the reference point.
E.Call "Clear of the area" including altitude when 10 NM from the 
reference point.
The section in the Houston Helicopters Operations Manual entitled "Midair Collision 
Prevention" stated:
A.Highest potential for birds around the coastal areas up to 1500'.
B.Highest potential for aircraft around airports, rigs, offshore fields, and 
heliports.
C.In single pilot crews, the pilot shall ensure that he establishes a 
constant and organized scan pattern, occasionally changing the the position 
of his head so that his vision is not obscured by a part of the aircraft.
D.In multi-pilot, one crewmember shall always be conducting a visual 
search outside the aircraft.  Primary responsibility for outside scan is:  During VFR 
conditions:  Flying Pilot During IFR conditions:  Non-
Flying Pilot
No references to the HSAC traffic advisory area recommended practices were found in the 
Houston Helicopters Operations Manual.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
Wreckage from the two helicopters was located in a debris field and at two main sites in the 
slough and marsh north of the Leland Bowman Lock on the Intracoastal Waterway.  N115AL 
came to rest submerged in the slough, approximately 29 degrees 47.25 minutes north latitude 
and 92 degrees 12.40 minutes west longitude.  About 1,000 feet to the west, the fuselage of 
N2773A came to rest on the north bank of the slough, approximately 29 degrees 47.32 minutes 
north latitude and 92 degrees 12.55 minutes west longitude.
All major components of N115AL were recovered from the slough.  The main rotor mast 
separated approximately 2 and 1/2 inches below the upper end, and the fracture surface 
displayed evidence of shear overload.  Divers found the main rotor hub and blade assembly 
submerged beside the fuselage.  The tail boom separated about 1 foot aft of the fuselage attach 
point, but remained attached to the fuselage by wires which were cut during recovery.  
Examination of the tail boom, tail rotor, horizontal stabilizer, vertical fin, and landing gear of 
N115AL did not reveal the presence of any rotor strikes or paint transfers.  One main rotor 
blade strike was noted on the upper left side of N115AL's fuselage above the baggage 
compartment door.  This strike slanted slightly downward from front to rear and had 
deformed, but not penetrated, the fuselage skin.
Examination of N115AL's main rotor blades revealed evidence of impact damage to the 
outboard portions of both blades.  Damage to the red blade consisted of a section of chordwise 
scratches and gouges on the leading edge and underside of the blade extending from the tip 
inboard about 2 and 1/2 feet.  Blue paint transfers were present on the leading edge of the 
blade overlaying the scratches.  
Damage to N115AL's white blade was more severe, consisting of a section of chordwise 
scratches and gouges on the leading edge and underside of the blade extending from the tip 
inboard about 3 and 1/2 feet.  A pattern of alternating bands of white and black paint transfers 
corresponding to the paint pattern on the tail rotor blades of N2773A was identified on the 
underside of the blade inboard of the heaviest gouges.  Additionally, red paint transfers were 
found on the leading edge of the blade in an area approximately 2 feet wide beginning about 1 
and 1/2 feet inboard from the tip.
The fuselage of N2773A came to rest inverted on a measured magnetic heading of 110 degrees.  
The main rotor mast separated about midway between the transmission and the rotor head, 
and the fracture surface displayed evidence of shear overload.  The tail boom separated along a 
diagonal cut running forward and down from approximately 18 inches to 3 inches aft of the tail 
boom attach point.  Sheet metal at the edges of the separation was deformed in a pattern 
indicating the cut was made from the upper left towards the lower right.  The left and right 
float trays were severed approximately 2 feet and 5 feet forward of their aft ends, respectively.  
(Float trays are installed in place of skids on some helicopters operated offshore.) 
The debris field extended into the marsh for a distance of approximately 435 feet on a 
northeasterly heading from the fuselage of N2773A.  Items recovered at the northeast end of 
the debris field included the tip section of one tail rotor blade and the upper portion of the 
vertical fin from N2773A.  The tail rotor blade section measured about 18 inches long and was 
cut along a diagonal line slanting towards the tail rotor hub from the trailing edge towards the 
leading edge.  The vertical fin was cut on a diagonal line slanting downward from the rear 
towards the front, and an aluminum casting shard, measuring about 6 inches long, was 
embedded in the left side of the fin.  The shard was identified as part of the tail rotor blade yoke 
of N2773A.
Additional items recovered from the debris field and identified as belonging to N2773A 
included the main rotor hub and blade assembly, a section of the tail boom with the horizontal 
stabilizer attached, the rear portions of both float trays, the left forward door, the baggage 
compartment door, and pieces of the left forward fuselage structure.  The only item recovered 
from the debris field that was identified as belonging to N115AL was a 5 foot section of the after 
body of the red main rotor blade which was found near the upper portion of the vertical fin of 
N2773A.
Both of N2773A's main rotor blades remained attached to the rotor hub.  The red blade was 
intact and displayed no evidence of impact damage.  The white blade separated about 8 feet 
outboard of the hub, and the separated section was not recovered.  At the point of separation, 
the after body of the white blade was crushed and bent as though it had contacted a tube with a 
diameter similar to that of the helicopter's crosstubes.
The section of N2773A's tail boom recovered from the debris field extended from the 
previously described diagonal cut just aft of the fuselage attach point to a second diagonal cut 
aft of the horizontal stabilizer.   The second cut ran forward and down from approximately 64 
inches to 52 inches aft of the aft edge of the horizontal stabilizer attach plate.  Sheet metal at 
the edges of the separation was deformed in a pattern indicating the cut was made from the left 
towards the right.  Projecting the plane of this separation aft and upward indicated that the cut 
corresponded to the separation of the upper portion of the vertical fin.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
The pilot of N115AL submitted a urine sample about 1335 on June 1, 1997, in accordance with 
Air Logistics's drug testing program.  The sample was tested at an independent laboratory for 
THC, cocaine, PCP, opiates, and amphetamines with negative results.  At 1347 on June 1, 1997, 
the pilot of N115AL was administered a breath alcohol test, and the result was negative. 
An autopsy of the pilot of N2773A was performed by Emil M. Laga, M.D., of New Iberia, 
Louisiana.  Toxicological tests were performed by the FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute 
(CAMI).  According to Dr. Canfield of CAMI, the finding of 92.600 ug/ml salicylate (aspirin) in 
the pilot's urine "is insignificant."  
TESTS AND RESEARCH
Radar data for the two helicopters, recorded by the U.S. Air Force at the aerostat (tethered 
balloon) site located about 25 nautical miles east of Intracoastal City,  were examined by the 
NTSB.  The data indicated that between 1122:18 and 1123:55, N115AL headed approximately 
west (270 degrees) while its ground speed fluctuated around 80 knots.  During this time, the 
helicopter's Mode C altitude increased from 400 feet msl to 1,000 feet msl.  Between 1123:55 
and 1124:08, N115AL's ground speed increased to approximately 105 knots, and its Mode C 
altitude decreased to 800 feet msl, while its heading remained west.  The last radar return from 
N115AL was recorded at 1124:08. 
Radar data indicated that between 1121:17 and 1124:20, N2773A headed south southwest (210 
degrees) while its ground speed fluctuated around 110 knots.  From 1121:17 to 1122:06, 
N2773A's Mode C altitude was 600 feet msl.  At 1122:18, the helicopter's Mode C altitude 
decreased to 500 feet msl where it remained until the last radar return from N2773A was 
recorded at 1124:20.
The last radar sweep which recorded returns from both helicopters occurred approximately 
1123:55.  At that time, N2773A was located approximately 0.4 nautical miles on a northwesterly 
heading from N115AL.  See the enclosed NTSB Recorded Radar Study for further details.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
N115AL was recovered from the water on the evening of June 1, 1997, and transported to Air 
Logistics Airframe Rebuild Hangar in New Iberia, Louisiana, where it was examined on June 2, 
3, and 4, 1997.  The fuselage and tail boom section of N2773A were examined at the accident 
site on June 2, 1997, and then transported to Houston Helicopters' base at the Abbeville 
Municipal Airport in Abbeville, Louisiana, where they were examined on June 3, 1997.  On 
June 4, 1997, the tail boom section of N2773A was transported to New Iberia and examined in 
conjunction with the wreckage of N115AL.  Subsequently, both helicopters were conditionally 
released to their respective owners for removal to secure storage.
During the initial on scene investigation, the only item recovered from the debris field was the 
tail boom section of N2773A.  In February 1998, additional items were recovered from the 
debris field.  On March 26, 1998, these newly recovered items and the wreckage recovered in 
June 1997 were examined at the facilities of Arrow Aviation in Broussard, Louisiana.  
Following this examination, the two helicopters were released to their respective owners.
