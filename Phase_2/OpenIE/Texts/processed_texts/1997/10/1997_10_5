After lowering the landing gear the pilot confirmed that it was down and locked while on final 
approach.  After touchdown during the landing roll, the nose landing gear collapsed.  Post 
incident trouble shooting of the hydraulic system revealed that the landing gear hydraulic 
selector valve failed to hold pressure resulting in the collapse of the nose landing gear. 
the partial failure of a component of the hydraulic system resulting in the collapse of the nose 
landing gear during the landing roll.
 On October 1, 1997, about 1615 eastern daylight time, a Grumman G-73, N168WS, registered 
to Pantechnicon Aviation Ltd., experienced a collapse of the nose landing gear during the 
landing roll at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed for the 14 
CFR Part 91 type-rating flight.  The airplane sustained minor damage and the airline-transport 
rated type rating applicant/pilot, second pilot, and an FAA operations inspector were not 
injured.  The flight originated about 1215 from the same airport.
     The pilot-in-command stated that the gear operated normally during the flight which 
included several gear extensions and retractions.  While on final approach, the landing gear 
indicator indicated that the gear was down which was confirmed once after landing gear 
extension, and again on short final.  After touchdown during the landing roll at an indicated 
airspeed of about 40 knots, the nose landing gear collapsed.
     Post incident trouble shooting of the hydraulic system revealed that the landing gear 
hydraulic selector valve failed to hold pressure resulting in the collapse of the nose landing 
gear.  Pressure testing of the valve revealed that a poppet valve part number 27580, was 
bypassing fluid.  The O-rings were replaced and the poppet valve continued to bypass fluid.
