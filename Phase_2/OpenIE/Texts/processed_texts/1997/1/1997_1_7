According to the pilot, he touched down hard and bounced. He released back pressure on the 
control yoke and the nose of the airplane subsequently dropped. The airplane porpoised three 
times and came to a stop. The propeller had struck the runway, the nose gear was bent, the 
firewall was bent, and the fuselage underside was wrinkled. 
The pilot's improper recovery from a bounced landing. A factor was the pilot's improper level 
off. 
 On January 2, 1997, about 1700 eastern standard time, a Cessna 172N, N1445E, landed 
hard at the Anderson County Airport, Anderson, South Carolina. The airplane was operated 
under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91, and visual flight rules. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed. A flight plan was not filed for the personal flight. The private pilot and his 
passenger were not injured, and the airplane was substantially damaged. Origination of the 
flight was Augusta, Georgia, about 1615, on the same day.
The pilot reported that his approach to landing was acceptable, crossing the threshold at 
60 knots. At touch down the airplane ballooned, then porpoised three times onto the nose 
landing gear. The pilot examined the airplane after it had stopped on the runway. The nose 
gear was bent rearward and the fuselage underside was wrinkled. The pilot also indicated that 
it was his first flight in a 172, with his prior experience all in a 150. He stated that he received a 
checkout from the same FBO in a 152 in August 1996. When he rented the airplane for this 
flight, he was assigned N1445E.
