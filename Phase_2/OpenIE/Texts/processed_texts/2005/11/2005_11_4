The 485-hour flight instructor and the 11-hour student pilot were executing a crosswind 
landing during a local training flight.  Shortly after touch down on Runway 17R, the nose 
landing gear collapsed, and the airplane began to skid down the runway.  While attempting to 
bring the airplane to a stop, the propeller and left wing contacted the ground.  The winds at the 
time of the mishap were reported from 180 degrees at 11 knots.   An examination of the 
airplane by an Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that the axel for the 
nose landing gear was missing and it was later located along the centerline of the runway.  The 
lock nut securing the axle to the landing gear assembly was not located, and it was not 
determined why the nut was not in place.  The last annual inspection was completed on 
October 24, 2005, about 22.2 hours prior to the mishap.  No recent maintenance was reported 
on the nose landing gear assembly.
The pilot's inability to maintain directional control of the airplane while landing due to the 
separation of the nose landing gear tire assembly.
