The pilot was conducting external load operations, when a gust of wind blew the lifting strap 
into the tail rotor.  The helicopter began to shudder, and rotate to the left.  The pilot entered an 
autorotation; however, during landing, the helicopter rolled over onto its left side.  Winds 
reported at an airport located about 4 miles east-southeast of the accident site, about the time 
of the accident, were from 200 degrees at 17 knots, with 23 knot gusts.
The inadvertent contact of a lift strap with the tail rotor during external load operations, which 
resulted in a forced landing and subsequent collision with terrain.  A factor in this accident was 
the gusty wind conditions.
