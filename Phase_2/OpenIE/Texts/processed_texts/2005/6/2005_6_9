The pilot performed a preflight inspection but stated that he failed to visually check the fuel 
quantity in the tanks.  Approximately 30 minutes into the flight, the engine started sputtering 
and the pilot turned on the electric fuel pump.  The engine lost power and efforts by the pilot to 
restart the engine were unsuccessful.  The pilot located a pasture for an emergency landing and 
was approximately 50 feet above the ground when he banked hard to the right to avoid four 
poles sticking out of the ground.  As the pilot continued to maneuver for the emergency 
landing, the airplane collided with the ground.  The post-accident examination of the airplane 
revealed that the fuel gauge was on 'E' and there was no fuel recovered from the fuel tanks. The 
examination of the airplane also revealed that the fuel tanks were not breached.
The pilot's inadequate preflight planning which resulted in fuel exhaustion and subsequent loss 
of engine power.
