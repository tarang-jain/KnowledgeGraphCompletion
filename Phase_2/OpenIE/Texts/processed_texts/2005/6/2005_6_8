According to the pilot, when he departed his departure airport for his short cross-country flight 
he requested to fly visual flight rules on top due to the low visibility. Upon arriving at the 
destination airport, the pilot discovered that there was a cloud layer over the airport. He looked 
for an opening in the clouds so that he could begin his descent. During the descent through the 
clouds the pilot encountered instrument meteorological conditions. As the flight descended 
through the clouds, the airplane collided with the ground. The pilot did not report any flight 
control or mechanical anomalies prior to the accident. The nearest weather reporting facility 
Crossville Memorial Airport reported: scattered clouds at 1000 feet, overcast at 1700 feet, and 
seven miles visibility.
The pilot's continued VFR flight into IMC conditions which resulted in an in-flight collision 
with trees.  A related factor was the clouds.
