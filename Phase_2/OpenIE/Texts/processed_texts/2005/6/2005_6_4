After takeoff, the student pilot remained in the traffic pattern and intended to practice landings 
in the tail-wheeled airplane.  During the student pilot's first landing attempt, the airplane 
bounced, and touched down with a "left crab."  He attempted to straighten the airplane; 
however, it departed the left side of the runway and struck a fence.  The student pilot reported 
40 hours of total flight experience, which included about 30 hours in the same make and model 
as the accident airplane.  He did not report any mechanical malfunctions.
The student pilot's improper recovery from a bounced landing and his failure to maintain 
directional control while landing.
