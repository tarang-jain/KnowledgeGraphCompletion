The pilot stated that he had been practicing short field approaches at the Sandpoint Airport 
with a flight instructor and then decided to go to his property where he had a private airstrip.  
The pilot stated that the flight instructor was flying the glider, making a low approach over the 
airstrip when he unexpectedly decided to land.  The airspeed was too high to stop on the 
remaining runway which was covered with compacted snow.  After rolling about 300 feet, the 
flight instructor applied full throttle for the takeoff.  The pilot pointed out the power lines 
beyond the end of the runway, and the flight instructor stated that they would fly under them.  
At this time the left wing struck a tractor that was positioned at the end of the airstrip.  The 
wing separated from the airframe and the glider spun around, coming to rest.  The pilot stated 
that there was no mechanical failure or malfunction with the glider at the time of the accident.
Excessive speed for the landing roll and inadequate remedial action for the initial takeoff.  An 
object near the end of the runway and snow covered surface were factors.
