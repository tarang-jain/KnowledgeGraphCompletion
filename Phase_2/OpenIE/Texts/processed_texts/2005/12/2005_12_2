The airplane made a hard landing on a road after losing engine power.  The flight was the 
return leg of a long cross-country from Kansas, that included an intermediate refueling stop in 
New Mexico.  The pilot departed the intermediate airport with 49 gallons of fuel on board and 
thought he had enough fuel to make it to his destination.  As the flight neared the destination 
airport the pilot reported to the TRACON controller that he had a low fuel state.  The controller 
suggested a closer alternate airport.  While attempting to land at the alternate airport, the pilot 
encountered adverse weather conditions including turbulence and crosswinds that exceeded 
the capabilities of the airplane.   He decided instead to make a forced landing on a winding and 
undulating road.  The engine lost power at this point and the pilot switched fuel tanks.  The 
engine restarted for about 20 seconds and then lost power again. The pilot was unable to see 
the rising road in the darkness and did not perform a flare.  The airplane landed hard and came 
to rest in between the road and a ditch.
fuel exhaustion due to the pilot's inadequate in-flight planning and fuel consumption 
calculations.
