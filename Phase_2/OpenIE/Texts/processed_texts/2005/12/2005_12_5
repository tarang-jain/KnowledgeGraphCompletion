The certificated flight instructor (CFI) and student pilot were practicing hovering over a grass 
area.  The CFI reported that the student pilot was flying the helicopter, while he "shadowed" 
the controls and performed corrective inputs.  While hovering, the helicopter's tail rotor 
contacted the ground and the helicopter rolled over onto it's right side.  Examination of the 
helicopter did not reveal any pre-impact malfunctions.   Winds reported at the airport, about 
the time of the accident were variable from 230 to 300 degrees, with the predominate wind 
from 280 degrees at 7 knots, gusting to 20 knots.
The flight instructor's failure to maintain adequate clearance while providing hovering 
instruction, which resulted in tail rotor ground contact.  A factor in this accident was the gusty 
wind conditions.
