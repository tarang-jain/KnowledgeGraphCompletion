After encountering downdrafts, the glider was damaged when the pilot landed on unsuitable 
brush-covered mountainous terrain.  The commercial pilot had planned to take the fare-paying 
passenger on a 45-minute-long sightseeing ride.  Downdrafts were encountered after soaring 
for nearly 30 minutes.  The pilot was unable to cross over a mountain ridge and to get to the 
airport.  The pilot landed on the brush covered mountainside in an uphill direction and at 
minimum speed.   
The flight's encounter with downdrafts.  A contributing factor was the unsuitable vegetation-
covered mountainous terrain.
