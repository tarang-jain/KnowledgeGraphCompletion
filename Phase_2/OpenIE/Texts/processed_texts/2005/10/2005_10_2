The pilot said that soon after departure from runway 33, he inadvertently entered a fog "bank."  
He said that he attempted a climbing right turn to return to the clear air over the departure 
runway.  He said that his airspeed dropped, and the aircraft stalled subsequently impacting 
trees and descended vertically to the mountain side.  The airplane came to rest inverted 
bending and wrinkling both wings and the fuselage.
The pilot's inadvertently flying into IMC weather conditions, his failure to maintain sufficient 
airspeed for flight, and his subsequent inadvertent stall/mush into trees.  Contributing factors 
were the fog and the trees.
