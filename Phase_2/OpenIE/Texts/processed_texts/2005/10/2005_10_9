The pilot and flight instructor were practicing soft field landings on the turf runway.  During 
the landing rollout, the right main landing gear collapsed and the airplane nosed over.  The 
right landing gear was fractured completely around a weld where the gear attached to the 
spindle assembly.  Metallurgical examination of the fracture revealed features typical of an 
overstress separation, with no evidence of fatigue cracking.
