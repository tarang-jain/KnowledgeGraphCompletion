During cruise flight, the pilot experienced a loss of engine power of one engine. Using standard 
engine out procedures , the pilot experienced difficulty identifying which engine had lost 
power.  However, without the knowledge of the pilot, the passenger attempted to assist the 
pilot in maintaining directional control after initial loss of engine power by applying right 
rudder. In an effort by the pilot to regain full engine power, the second engine lost power.  The 
pilot selected a nearby landfill for an emergency landing. During the emergency landing, the 
main landing gear collapsed. After the pilot and passenger exited the airplane, the passenger 
told the pilot that he had applied right rudder after the initial loss of engine power.   Post-
accident examination  of both engines failed to disclose any abnormalities and 35 gallons of 
fuel was recovered from the fuel system. 
The pilot mistakenly shut down the operating engine when the passenger interfered with the 
rudder pedals as he attempted to identify the inoperative engine.
