The 261-hour private pilot lost directional control of the tailwheel-equipped single-engine 
airplane while landing on runway 15 (a 7,202-foot long by 100-foot wide paved runway).  The 
pilot reported "the winds at the airport were gusting" and after touchdown the airplane 
departed the right side of the runway traveling 250 feet on unimproved grass.  After departing 
the runway, the right main wheel assembly separated from the landing gear strut.  Shortly 
thereafter, the airplane ground looped, coming to rest in the upright position.  Automated 
weather at the airport reported the winds from 170 degrees at 10 knots.  The pilot reported 
having accumulated a total of 35 hours in the same make and model.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control while landing.  A contributing factor was the 
wind gusts.
