The helicopter impacted a support wire between two poles while it was conducting aerial 
applications.  The pilot completed spraying the field and was getting ready to spray the 
borders.  He checked the power lines near the field and elected to fly beneath them to prevent 
drift over the adjacent field.  As the pilot neared the wires for the spray run, he noticed a guy-
wire running from pole-to-pole below the power lines.  He lowered to collective, but the 
helicopter snagged the wire with the top portion of the vertical stabilizer.  The helicopter then 
impacted terrain and rolled into a canal.

flight.
