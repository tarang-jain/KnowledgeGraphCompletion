The flight encountered light mixed icing during descent.  The airplane was in icing conditions 
for about 15 minutes.  The pilot used the de-icing boots during the icing encounter and cycled 
the boots for the last time on downwind leg for landing.  During the landing flare, he reduced 
power over the threshold about 15 feet agl, and the airplane stalled at a higher than normal 
airspeed resulting in a hard landing.  The pilot stated that the accident could have been 
prevented by keeping power and airspeed up until touchdown when landing an airplane which 
has encountered icing conditions and retained some airframe ice.
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed during landing with airframe ice, which 
resulted in an inadvertent stall and hard landing.  Factors were the icing conditions and the 
airframe ice.
