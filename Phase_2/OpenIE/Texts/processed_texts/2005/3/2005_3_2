The operator reported that the certificated commercial pilot was departing from a private 
airstrip in a turbine-powered airplane with 3,500 pounds of fertilizer on board.  The operator 
noted that the accident flight was the pilot's first flight of the day, and that there was "heavy 
frost on the aircraft" prior to departure.  During the pilot's takeoff run on the rough and uneven 
airstrip, the airplane's main wheels struck a bump that bounced the airplane into the air.  Once 
the airplane was airborne, it rolled left, and the left wing struck the ground. The operator 
wrote, in part: "At this point, the aircraft was trying to gain altitude, but stalled and went into 
the trees under full power..."  The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, 
and empennage.  The operator reported that there were no preaccident mechanical anomalies 
with the airplane.                
 
The pilot's failure to remove frost from the airplane which resulted in an inadvertent 
stall/mush during the takeoff/initial climb, and an in-flight collision with trees.  Contributing 
to the accident were the rough and uneven airstrip, and degraded aircraft performance due to 
frost on the wing.
