The pilot stated this was his first flight in this specific airplane and after a orientation flight, 
they returned to the Bartow Municipal Airport to land.  Upon making a three point landing,  
the airplane seemed normal, but it then began to swerve to the left.  The pilot corrected with 
rudder, but passed through the center line of the runway.  The airplane then began to bounce 
traveling perpendicular to the centerline.  The right main wheel separated from the spring 
shank and at this point it dug into the runway spinning aircraft to the right.  The plane settled 
down on its belly, right wing low. The pilot-rated passenger stated that the preflight, takeoff, 
taxi, flight, and landing approach were all normal, until touchdown, when the airplane ground-
looped.  During the landing roll an uncontrolled turn to the left commenced,  then it tightened 
up, damaging the landing gear and causing the wing tip to drag, followed by the propeller 
striking the runway.  The aircraft came to rest after spinning 270-degrees, and stopped at the 
edge of the runway. The pilots stated there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions to the 
airplane or any of its systems prior to the accident.
The pilots failure to maintain directional control resulting in the airplane ground-looping. A 
factor in the accident was the pilots lack of total experience in the airplane make and model.
