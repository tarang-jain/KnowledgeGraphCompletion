While landing in a 10 to 16 knot crosswind, the tailwheel airplane bounced several times and 
veered left.  The pilot attempted to correct with right brake input, left aileron input, and right 
rudder input; however, the brakes locked and the airplane came to rest inverted.  The pilot 
reported no pre-impact mechanical malfunctions with the airplane.
The pilot's inadequate recovery from a bounced landing.  A factor was the crosswind.
