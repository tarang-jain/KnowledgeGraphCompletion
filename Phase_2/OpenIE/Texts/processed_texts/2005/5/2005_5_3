During landing, the pilot lost directional control, ground looped, and nosed over.  The pilot 
stated that he departed the airport to go to the practice area.  Upon returning to the airport, he 
used a slipping final for visibility, and to correct for a crosswind.  When the wheels touched 
down, the airplane began to deviate left of center.  The pilot corrected to the right, the left wing 
contacted the ground, and the airplane crossed to the right side of runway.  The prop struck the 
runway and the airplane slowly nosed over.  The pilot then turned off the fuel, master switch, 
and magnetos.  Both occupants exited from the inverted airplane by sliding the canopy open.  
The closest official weather observation station was located 15 nautical miles (nm) northeast of 
the accident site and was reporting winds variable at 06 knots.  The pilot reported that the 
winds at the airport were from 280 degrees at 12 knots.  The pilot stated that the airplane and 
engine had no mechanical failures or malfunctions during the flight.
the pilot's inadequate compensation for the crosswind conditions and failure to maintain 
directional control, which resulted in a ground loop and nose over.
