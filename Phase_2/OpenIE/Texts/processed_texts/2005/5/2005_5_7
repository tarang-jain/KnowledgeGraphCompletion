The pilot stated that he was flying traffic patterns and was practicing landings to a full stop. His 
first landing was satisfactory, just landing beyond the runway numbers. The second traffic 
pattern was again satisfactory until he was on short final approach. His airspeed was too high, 
and the airplane touched down just passed the runway numbers and bounced "high".  He 
misjudged the severity of the bounced landing and failed to apply engine power to correct the 
situation. The airplane immediately started to porpoise, and became "uncontrollable". The 
pilot stated there were no mechanical failures or malfunction to the airplane or any of it's 
systems prior to the accident.
The pilot's improper flare and recovery from a bounced landing.
