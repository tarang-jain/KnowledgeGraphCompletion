The airplane encountered a dust devil during the takeoff ground roll, then it veered off the 
runway, and collided with a berm.  About 600 feet into the takeoff ground roll the airplane 
veered to the left and continued in that direction even with the pilot's counteractive control 
input.  During the event, the pilot reduced the power, the right main landing gear sheared off, 
and the airplane came to rest on the right wing and horizontal stabilizer.  Witnesses informed 
the pilot that they observed a dust devil approach the airplane during takeoff roll.  The pilot 
reported experiencing no anomalies with the airframe or engine prior to the event.
the pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane upon encountering a dust devil 
during the takeoff roll.
