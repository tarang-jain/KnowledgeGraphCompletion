The airplane experienced a partial loss of engine power and the pilot ditched in the ocean.  
While en route over the ocean on a fish-spotting mission, the pilot noticed a decrease in engine 
power.  The pilot's scan of the cockpit gauges revealed no anomalies, with the exception of a 
slight rise in oil temperature.  As the pilot maneuvered the airplane toward land, the oil 
temperature continued to rise and he heard a loud "bang" followed by a vibration.  Engine oil 
began to cover the windshield and the airplane continued to lose altitude.  With the engine still 
running, the pilot ditched the airplane in the ocean about 5 miles from the coastline.  The 
airplane sank to the ocean floor, about 1,200 feet underwater.
a partial loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.
