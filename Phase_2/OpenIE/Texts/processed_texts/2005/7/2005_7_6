The 7,300-hour captain was unable to maintain directional control of the twin turbojet 
airplane while landing on Runway 04 during day VMC conditions with winds from 130 degrees 
at 17 knots.  The 13,502-feet-long, by 300-feet-wide-grooved runway was reported as dry at the 
time of the mishap.   The airplane struck a runway distance marker, and exited the runway to 
the left during landing roll.  The left wingtip tank fuel load was 200-300 pounds heavier than 
the right wingtip during landing.  Examination of the airplane by maintenance personnel did 
not reveal any discrepancies in the fuel transfer system.
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll.  A contributing factor 
was the prevailing crosswind.
