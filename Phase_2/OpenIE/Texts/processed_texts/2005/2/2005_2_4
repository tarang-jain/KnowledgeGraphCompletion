Aircraft Accident Report number is NTSB/AAR-06/04.
On February 2, 2005, about 0718 eastern standard time, a Bombardier Challenger CL-600-
1A11, N370V, ran off the departure end of runway 6 at Teterboro Airport (TEB), Teterboro, 
New Jersey, at a ground speed of about 110 knots; through an airport perimeter fence; across a 
six-lane highway (where it struck a vehicle); and into a parking lot before impacting a building. 
The two pilots were seriously injured, as were two occupants in the vehicle. The cabin aide, 
eight passengers, and one person in the building received minor injuries. The airplane was 
destroyed by impact forces and postimpact fire. The accident flight was an on-demand 
passenger charter flight from TEB to Chicago Midway Airport, Chicago, Illinois. The flight was 
subject to the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 and operated by 
Platinum Jet Management, LLC (PJM), Fort Lauderdale, Florida, under the auspices of a 
charter management agreement with Darby Aviation (Darby), Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated on an instrument flight rules 
flight plan.
the pilots' failure to ensure the airplane was loaded within weight and balance limits and their 
attempt to takeoff with the center of gravity well forward of the forward takeoff limit, which 
prevented the airplane from rotating at the intended rotation speed.   
Contributing to the accident were: 1) PJM's conduct of charter flights (using PJM pilots and 
airplanes) without proper Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification and its failure to 
ensure that all for-hire flights were conducted in accordance with 14 CFR Part 135 
requirements; 2) Darby Aviation's failure to maintain operational control over 14 CFR Part 135 
flights being conducted under its certificate by PJM, which resulted in an environment 
conducive to the development of systemic patterns of flight crew performance deficiencies like 
those observed in this accident; 3) the failure of the Birmingham, Alabama, FAA Flight 
Standards District Office to provide adequate surveillance and oversight of operations 
conducted under Darby's Part 135 certificate; and 4) the FAA's tacit approval of arrangements 
such as that between Darby and PJM.
