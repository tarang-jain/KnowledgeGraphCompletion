The airplane encountered soft soil and nosed over during a landing overrun.  The pilot said he 
touched down beyond the threshold and the airplane bounced once.  By the time the pilot had 
recovered from the bounce and the airplane was in the landing rollout, the pilot determined 
that insufficient runway remained to stop the airplane.  He elected not to perform an aborted 
landing due to the short runway and continued braking efforts.  The airplane overran the end 
of the runway and the nose landing gear encountered soft dirt.  The airplane nosed over and 
came to rest inverted.
the pilot's inadequate recovery from a bounced landing, and his failure to abort the landing.
