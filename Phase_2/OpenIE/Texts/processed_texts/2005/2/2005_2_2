The airplane, piloted by a private pilot receiving instruction from a certified flight instructor 
(CFI), sustained substantial damage during a hard landing following a simulated loss of engine 
power during takeoff and subsequent emergency landing after takeoff.  The pilot's accident 
report stated, "On climb out, the air speed was held between 63 and 65 knots (Vy).  To simulate 
an engine failure, the CFI reduced the throttle.  Immediately upon noticing the loss of power, I 
lowered the nose of the aircraft to avoid loss of airspeed and to avoid a wing stall.  While 
maintaining control of the aircraft, altitude was lost.  An attempt was made to flare the aircraft 
before contact with the runway.  Subsequently, a hard landing was made, and the aircraft came 
to a complete stop on the runway."  The CFI's accident report stated, "We then made a short 
field takeoff and during the takeoff I simulated an engine failure.  We immediately pushed the 
nose over but with insufficient airspeed we developed a high sink rate and made a hard 
landing."  The CFI stated that there were no mechanical malfunctions associated with the 
airplane during the flight.  The wind was calm.
The pilot not maintaining airspeed leading to an excessive sink rate during a simulated 
emergency landing after takeoff.  An additional cause was the certified flight instructor's 
inadequate supervision.
