The 99-hour student pilot, who had logged 2.4 hours of solo time, reported that on final 
approach to runway 17, his airspeed was 61 knots.  He planned on making a normal landing, 
and when he reached the runway, he "pulled the throttle to idle and flared," but the airplane 
"hit the ground heavily and jumped back up."  The pilot then "lowered the airplane nose and 
flared again."  When the airplane touched down, the student pilot noticed that he was left of 
the centerline, so he applied right rudder.  "Suddenly, the nose gear broke, and the airplane 
nose fell on the ground."  The propeller then hit the ground and stopped, and the airplane 
came to a stop.  The student pilot performed the proper shutdown procedures and exited the 
airplane, uninjured.  Reported winds at the time of the landing on runway 17 were from 200 
degrees at 8 knots.
The pilot's improper landing flare and his inadequate recovery from a bounced landing.  A 
factor was the prevailing crosswind.
