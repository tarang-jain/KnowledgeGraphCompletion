The departure, climb, en route, and descent portions of the flight were conducted without 
incident.  The airplane was vectored onto the final approach course for the ILS 19 approach at 
Teterboro, New Jersey, and the captain configured the airplane to land.  He flew the approach 
at Vref plus 30 knots because of turbulence and reported wind gusts.  As he initiated a flare to 
land on runway 19, the airplane encountered windshear.  It touched down hard on the main 
landing gear, bounced, and then touched down again on the nose wheel.  The captain stabilized 
the airplane, slowed to taxi speed, and exited the runway.  Examination of the airplane 
revealed substantial damage to the pressure bulkhead in the vicinity of the nose gear box.  The 
wind 26 minutes prior to the accident was recorded as 150 degrees at 26 knots, gusting to 37 
knots.
The captain's improper recovery from a bounced. A factor in the accident was windshear.
