The private pilot reported he was landing the tailwheel-equipped airplane on runway 36, which 
required a correction for a left crosswind.  During the landing touchdown, the airplane 
bounced slightly and settled onto the right main tire.  He said he attempted to abort the 
landing, but the airplane went off the runway, and ground looped to the right.  The airplane 
sustained structural damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage.  The pilot noted there 
were no preaccident mechanical problems with the airplane. A weather observation taken at 
the time of the accident consisted of:  Sky conditions and ceiling, 1,500 feet scattered; visibility, 
10 statute miles; wind, 320 degrees (magnetic) at 11 knots.
 
The pilot's failure to compensate for a crosswind during an aborted landing, which resulted in a 
loss of directional control.  A factor associated with the accident was a crosswind.
