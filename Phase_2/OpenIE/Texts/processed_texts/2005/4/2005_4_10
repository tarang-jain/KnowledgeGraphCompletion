According to the pilot, while returning from a cross-country flight, he prepared to land on 
runway 23 at Union, South Carolina. As the airplane touched down on runway 23 the airplane 
bounced and veered to the right. The pilot applied the left brake and right engine power in an 
attempt to regain direction control of the airplane but was unsuccessful. Full power was added 
to abort the landing but the airplane did not regain flying speed. The pilot reduced the power in 
an attempt to regain control and stop the airplane. The airplane overran the departure end of 
the runway and collided with a berm. Examination of the airplane revealed the fuselage was 
buckled. The right main gear shared off, and the outboard section of the right wing. Post 
accident examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical or flight control malfunctions.
The pilot's delay in aborting the landing.  A contributing factor was the pilot's failure to 
maintain directional control.
