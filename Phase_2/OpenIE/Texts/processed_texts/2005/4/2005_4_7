Following a loss of engine power from the right engine during takeoff, the airplane veered to 
the right of the runway and collided with a hangar.  The pilot reported that he had found a leak 
in a fuel line fitting on the right engine during the flight prior to the accident.  He fixed the leak 
by tightening the fitting; however, he had not determined how much fuel remained in the right 
main fuel tank after the repair or during preflight for the accident flight.  The pilot said the 
start, taxi, and run-up were normal on both engines.  Just after liftoff, the airplane yawed to 
the right.  Despite full left rudder and aileron input, the pilot could not prevent the airplane 
from veering off the runway and colliding with a hangar.  An examination of the airplane after 
the accident determined that the fuel system for the right wing was still intact, and that there 
were no leaks.  The right auxiliary fuel tank was still full of fuel.  No fuel was found in the right 
main fuel tank or in any of the fuel lines leading to the right engine.
The pilot's inadequate aircraft preflight and failure to verify that an adequate fuel supply was in 
the right main tank prior to flight, resulting in a fuel starvation induced loss of engine power in 
the right engine.  Also causal was the pilot's failure to maintain directional control following 
the loss of engine power.
