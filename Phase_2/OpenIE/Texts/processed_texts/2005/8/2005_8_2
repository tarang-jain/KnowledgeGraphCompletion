The airplane sustained substantial damage when in veered off the end of the runway, impacted 
a utility pole, and nosed over during landing on a 1,800 feet by 75 feet grass runway.  The pilot 
reported that on final approach the airplane was configured with two notches of flaps with 80 
mph airspeed.  The airplane touched down in the first one-third of the runway and the pilot 
applied brakes.  The pilot reported the airplane was approaching the end of the runway so he 
applied a burst of power to initiate a go-around.  He reported that he saw power lines off the 
end of the runway, and since he was not airborne yet, he rejected the go-around and initiated 
heavy braking.  The airplane went off the end of the runway and veered to the right, impacting 
a utility pole.  The pilot reported the temperature was 96 degrees Fahrenheit, and that the 
high-density altitude affected the landing ground roll adversely.  The pilot reported that the 
approach speed noted in the Pilot Operating Handbook was 76 mph.
The airplane overran the runway and hit a utility pole due to the pilot's delayed decision 
making and his failure to execute a go-around.  Contributing factors included the exessive 
airspeed during the final approach, the high density altitude, the transmission wires, and the 
utility pole.
