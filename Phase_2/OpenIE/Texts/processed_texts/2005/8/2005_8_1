The private pilot reported that while practicing beach landings he made a low, slow pass over a 
beach to check its suitability for landing.  After determining the beach was suitable for landing, 
he made a left turn to the beach for landing.  He added flaps in the turn, and as he turned final, 
he realized he was too low and too slow.  He added power, but the airplane impacted terrain 
short of the intended landing area.  The landing gear collapsed, and the wings and fuselage 
impacted the ground.  The pilot stated there were no known mechanical anomalies with the 
airplane prior to the accident.
The pilot's misjudged distance/altitude during final approach, which resulted in an undershoot 
and an in-flight collision with terrain.
