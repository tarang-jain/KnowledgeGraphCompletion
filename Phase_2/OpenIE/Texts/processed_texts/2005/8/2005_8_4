The experimental amateur-built airplane was destroyed by fire during its taxi to parking after a 
landing.  The pilot stated, "After reaching pattern altitude I turned on boost pump and 
approach flaps, and opened cowl flaps.  I then pulled power back to enter upwind.  Engine felt 
like it was going to quit.  I entered down wind and pulled throttle back all the way.  I landed 
and turned on to taxi way.  There was smoke coming out of instrument panel.  I shut down 
everything and got out of plane to check front of plane.  Engine was still turning over then it 
stopped.  I went back inside to get fire extinguisher.  I went back outside and shot extinguisher 
up cow flaps.  Could not stop fire and plane was destroyed."  Examination of the wreckage did 
not reveal the source of the fire.
The undetermined cause of the fire during the taxi.
