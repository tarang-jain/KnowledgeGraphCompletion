Registration:
N1982F
Aircraft:
PIPER PA46
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Landing gear collapse

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot reported that, after a normal landing on the main landing gear in gusty 
quartering headwind conditions, the nose gear touched down and he heard a "pop," then he 
"started losing control of the airplane." The nose continued to drop past the normal landing 
attitude while the pilot applied back pressure to the yoke and focused his attention on stopping 
the airplane and maintaining directional control. The pilot added that there were no preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions with the airplane.
Examination of the nose landing gear revealed that the actuator was extended 6.8 inches, 
consistent with the nose gear being down and locked. This area of the nose gear assembly 
displayed gouging and missing material consistent with ground impact. The nose landing gear 
assembly was attached on the left side; however, the bolt was bent and the right side mounting 
point was fractured and separated from its attachment point, displaying fracture features 
consistent with overstress failure, which was likely the result of a hard landing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A hard landing, which resulted in the collapse of the nose gear assembly due to an overstress 
fracture and separation of the right side mounting point.

Factual Information
On March 1, 2016, at 1543 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-46-350P, N1982F, was 
substantially damaged after a nose gear collapse during landing rollout at McKinnon St. 
Simons Island Airport (SSI), Brunswick, Georgia. The private pilot and two passengers were 
not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules flight 
plan was filed for the personal flight operated under the provisions of Title 14 
Code of Federal 
Regulations 
Part 91. The flight departed from Florida Keys Marathon Airport (MTH), 
Marathon, Florida, about 1330.
The pilot stated that during the first approach to runway 16 at SSI, he performed a go-around 
due to some conflicting traffic in the airport traffic pattern. During the second approach, he 
configured the airplane the same as the first approach, with the manifold pressure at 16 inches, 
landing gear extended, and flaps extended 36° on final approach while trying to maintain an 
airspeed of 85 to 90 knots. The automated surface observation system was reporting the wind 
varying between 140° and 190° at 10 knots; however, the pilot observed the wind sock and a 
flag at that airport and estimated the wind speed as stronger, gusting up to 15 knots. As the 
airplane approached the runway, the wind gusts appeared stronger and he had difficulty 
keeping the airplane level. Just prior to touchdown, the pilot felt left-quartering wind gusts, 
and as the airplane touched down on the main landing gear, the landing appeared to be 
normal. Then, as the nose gear touched down, he heard a "pop" and then started "losing 
control of the nose." The nose continued to drop and he applied aft pressure on the control 
wheel and attempted to maintain directional control until the airplane came to a stop. He then 
instructed the passengers to evacuate and he performed the emergency procedures for 
shutdown, then egressed the airplane. The pilot added that there were no preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions with the airplane and that to the best of his knowledge, the main 
landing gear remained on the ground after touchdown. 
Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed 
that it had incurred substantial damage during the landing. The area of the nose landing gear 
bay exhibited crush damage with, the firewall was deformed, the wing leading edges were 
dented, and the fuselage displayed areas of compression buckling of the top and sides just 
forward of the windscreen. The nose landing gear assembly was attached on the left side, 
however the attaching bolt was bent and the right side mounting point was broken and 
separated from its attachment point. The nose landing gear actuator extended 6.8 inches, 
which according to the airframe manufacturer, was consistent with extension to the down and 
locked position. This area of the nose gear assembly displayed gouging and missing material 
consistent with ground impact. One of the composite propeller blades had separated near the 
root, and the other two blades exhibited damage at the tips, as well as scraping along the 
leading edges.
Examination of runway 16 revealed scrape marks consistent with propeller strikes along the 
centerline, about 800 feet from the threshold. There were 15 scrapes in a row, each about 12 
inches long, oriented perpendicular to the runway. The row was about 15 feet long. About 
2,000 feet down the runway and 20 feet to the right of the centerline, similar propeller scrapes 
were observed followed by longitudinal scars about 20 feet long, consistent with the color of 
Page 4 of 6ERA16LA121
the cowling in the nose gear area. No marks were observed for the next 150 feet, where the 
longitudinal scrapes resumed at the runway's right edge and continued another 250 feet to 
where the airplane came to rest on the paved area along the right side of the runway. 
According to FAA and maintenance records, the airplane was manufactured in 2012. The 
airplane's most recent 100 hour inspection was completed on October 14, 2015. At the time of 
the inspection, the airplane had accumulated 569 total hours of flight time.
The recorded wind at SSI, at 1553, was from 150° at 9 knots.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=92798
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
