Location:
Chester, CT
Accident Number:
ERA16LA122
Date & Time:
03/01/2016, 1130 EST 
Registration:
N94569
Aircraft:
CESSNA 152
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Runway excursion
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot completed a prerental checkout in the airplane and then departed for a local 
flight. Upon return to the airport, the pilot landed the airplane beyond the midpoint of the 
2,722-ft-long runway, and the airplane then veered off the right side of the runway and 
impacted a fence. The pilot reported no anomalies with the brakes to the operator during his 
prerental checkout in the airplane. However, after the accident, he reported that one of the 
brakes felt "spongy" during the landing attempt. Postaccident examination of the brakes 
revealed no evidence of any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during the landing, which 
resulted in a runway excursion.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)

Factual Information
On March 1, 2016, about 1130 eastern standard time, a Cessna 152, N94569, was substantially 
damaged during a runway excursion after landing at the Chester Airport (SNC), Chester, 
Connecticut. The private pilot was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and 
no flight plan was filed for the local flight conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 91. 
According to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, the airplane landed on 
runway 35, a dry, 2,722-foot-long, 50-foot-wide, asphalt runway. After landing, the airplane 
continued off the right side on the runway, through a fence, and came to rest in the grassy area. 
According to witnesses, the airplane touched down about 200 feet beyond the midpoint of the 
runway. 
In a written statement the pilot stated that during rollout the right brake felt "ok", but the left 
brake felt "spongy", and that the airplane failed to stop before it departed the right side of the 
runway. According to a flight instructor for the operator, he and the pilot flew together for 
approximately two hours on both the day before and the day of the accident to complete a pre-
rental checkout for the pilot in the accident airplane. At no time did the pilot mention 
anomalies or malfunctions of the airplane's braking system.
Postaccident examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector and an airframe and powerplant 
mechanic revealed substantial damage to the engine firewall. Functional testing of the brakes 
showed that they were operational and did not reveal evidence any pre- or post-impact 
mechanical anomalies. A detailed examination of the brake revealed that there were no signs of 
hydraulic fluid or damage to the brake lines, and the brake pucks were nominal in size with no 
abnormal wear. 
The airplane was equipped with a Lycoming O-235 series, 108-horsepower engine. The 
airplane had been operated for about 100 hours since its most recent annual inspection, which 
was performed on September 1, 2015.
The pilot reported 1,300 hours of total flight experience, of which 75 hours were in the accident 
airplane make and model.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
