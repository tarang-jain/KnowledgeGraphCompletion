Registration:
N8466G
Aircraft:
PIPER PA 28-161
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot was flying over the ocean and just off the coast when an air traffic controller 
asked him to descend to 500 ft. The pilot reduced engine power and applied carburetor heat 
until he reached the assigned altitude, and he then attempted to increase engine power and 
level off; however, even with the throttle full forward, the engine power remained at its 
previous setting. The pilot attempted to resolve the situation, but he was unable to maintain 
altitude and ditched the airplane in the ocean Although weather conditions were conducive to 
serious icing at glide power, the pilot had applied carburetor heat during the descent which 
should have melted any carburetor ice during the descent. A postaccident examination of the 
airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would 
have precluded normal operation. The cause for the partial loss of engine power could not be 
determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power for reasons that could not be determined because postaccident 
examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have contributed to 
the power loss.
Findings
Not determined

Factual Information
On February 2, 2016, at 1134 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-28-161, N8466G, ditched in the 
Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Miami, Florida, after a partial loss of engine power. The private 
pilot and the pilot-rated passenger were not injured. The airplane sustained substantial 
damage to the wings and the fuselage. The airplane was registered to a private company and 
operated by Airborne Career Academy, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, as a Title 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions were reported at the time 
of the accident, and no flight plan was filed for the flight that departed the Florida Keys 
Marathon Airport (MTH), Marathon, Florida, about 1100, and was destined for the Fort 
Lauderdale Executive Airport (FXE), Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
The flight originated at FXE earlier that day. The pilot stated that when he performed the 
engine run-up before departure, he noted that the right magneto had a higher drop in rpm than 
normal. He leaned the mixture and let the engine run for about a minute before he tested the 
magneto again. This time the magneto had the normal drop and the pilot subsequently 
departed for MTH. The flight was uneventful. The pilot said that on the flight back to FXE, air 
traffic control instructed him to descend 500 ft, so he reduced power and turned the carburetor 
heat on.  When he reached 500 ft, the pilot tried to increase engine RPM, but there was no 
response even when full throttle was applied. He switched fuel tanks and "jockeyed" the 
throttle a few times, but to no avail. The pilot was unable to maintain altitude and made a 
forced landing in the ocean about 100 ft offshore in about 15 ft of saltwater.
The airplane was towed to a boat ramp and recovered. Examination of the airplane revealed it 
had sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings. The ignition key was found 
in the "both" position, the fuel selector was set to the "right" tank, the throttle and mixture 
were full forward, and the carburetor-heat control was in the full "on" position. The left and 
right wing fuel tanks were contaminated with salt water and a fuel total for each tank could not 
be determined. The pilot reported there was about 17 gallons of fuel in each tank when they 
departed MTH.
The engine remained attached to the airframe. The two-bladed propeller appeared undamaged 
and the engine was free to rotate. When the propeller was rotated, compression and valve train 
continuity were established to each cylinder. Engine timing was established on the left 
magneto, but not on the right magneto due to damage. Both magnetos were removed and 
disassembled. Each was filled with sand and had some salt water corrosion. Once the corrosion 
was removed from the right magneto's points, they opened and closed normally. No pre-
accident mechanical anomalies were noted that would have precluded normal operation of the 
engine.
Weather at Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport (OPF), Opa Locka, Florida, about 20 miles 
west of the accident site, at 1125, was reported as wind from 120 degrees at 15 knots, visibility 
10 miles, few clouds at 2,100 ft, overcast 3,100 ft, temperature 81 degrees F, dewpoint 66 
degrees F, and a barometric pressure setting of 30.11 inches Hg.  A Federal Aviation 
Administration-published Carburetor Icing Chart revealed a potential for serious icing at glide 
engine power settings, given the reported temperature and dew point conditions.
The pilot held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land. His last 
Page 3 of 5ERA16LA103
FAA second-class medical certificate was issued on July 31, 2015, with no limitations. The pilot 
reported a total of 86 flight hours, of which all 86 hours were in the same make/model as the 
accident airplane.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=92683
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
