Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Neenah, WI
Accident Number:
CEN16LA309
Date & Time:
08/02/2016, 1830 CDT 
Registration:
N46459
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172K
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Powerplant sys/comp malf/fail
Injuries:
3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot was conducting the first flight in the airplane after having removed a failed 
vacuum pump from the engine; the pilot was not a certified airframe and powerplant 
mechanic. During the flight, the engine lost power, and the pilot subsequently landed the 
airplane on a highway, and the left wing contacted a road sign, which resulted in substantial 
damage. 
The pilot reported that he had recently had a mechanic remove a failed vacuum pump on a 
different airplane that he owned and that he was able to fly that airplane without the pump. As 
a result, he thought he could also fly the accident airplane without a vacuum pump. However, 
the vacuum pumps were mounted on each airplane differently, and the pilot's removal of the 
vacuum pump on the accident airplane allowed oil to exit the engine through the drive gear 
opening on the accessory case, which resulted in oil starvation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power due to oil starvation, which resulted from the pilot, who was not a 
certified airframe and powerplant mechanic, removing the vacuum pump from the engine, and 
his misconception that he could operate the airplane without the pump.

Factual Information
On August 2, 2016, at 1830 central daylight time, a Cessna 172K, N46459, collided with a road 
sign during an off airport forced landing on Highway 10 in Neenah, Wisconsin, following a loss 
of engine power. The private pilot and two passengers were not injured. The airplane received 
substantial damage to the left wing. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot 
under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was not operated on a flight plan. The 
local flight originated from the Brennand Airport (79C), Neenah, Wisconsin, at 1815.
The pilot reported that he owned another airplane, an RV7 that was equipped with a Jabiru 
5100 engine. The vacuum pump on that engine recently failed so a mechanic removed it until a 
new one was received. The vacuum pump on the Jabiru 5100 is fitted to the alternator 
mounting flange and the drive pad is dry. The pilot was told that he could fly the airplane 
without the vacuum pump installed which he did uneventfully for about 6 hours.
While flying the accident airplane, a Cessna 172, three days prior to the accident, the pilot 
noted the directional gyro and attitude indicator where not working. Because of the past 
experience with a vacuum pump failure on the RV7, he identified the problem as being a 
vacuum pump failure. The pilot held a Repairman Experimental Aircraft Builder certificate for 
the RV7, and stated that because he was comfortable working on that airplane, he decided to 
remove the vacuum pump from the accident airplane himself. He did not install a cover plate 
over the vacuum pump mounting pad. In addition, since he was able to fly the RV7 without a 
vacuum pump, he believed he could also fly the accident airplane without a vacuum pump 
installed. 
During the first flight after removing the vacuum pump, the airplane sustained a loss of engine 
power. The pilot landed the airplane on a highway, and while traveling up an exit ramp, the left 
wing contacted a road sign. The airplane spun around and came to rest in a ditch.
A postaccident examination of the engine revealed the engine suffered oil exhaustion when the 
oil exited the engine through the vacuum pump mount in the accessory case.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
