Analysis 
The NTSB's full report is available at 
http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/AccidentReports.aspx
. The 
Aircraft Accident Report number is NTSB/AAR-18/02.
On October 2, 2016, about 1157 Alaska daylight time, Ravn Connect flight 3153, a turbine-
powered Cessna 208B Grand Caravan airplane, N208SD, collided with steep, mountainous 
terrain about 10 nautical miles northwest of Togiak Airport (PATG), Togiak, Alaska. The two 
commercial pilots and the passenger were killed, and the airplane was destroyed. The 
scheduled commuter flight was operated under visual flight rules by Hageland Aviation 
Services, Inc., Anchorage, Alaska, under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 135. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at PATG (which had the closest weather 
observing station to the accident site), but a second company flight crew (whose flight departed 
about 2 minutes after the accident airplane and initially followed a similar route) reported that 
they observed unexpected fog, changing clouds, and the potential for rain along the accident 
route. Company flight-following procedures were in effect. The flight departed Quinhagak 
Airport, Quinhagak, Alaska, about 1133 and was en route to PATG.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight crew's decision to continue the visual flight rules flight into deteriorating visibility 
and their failure to perform an immediate escape maneuver after entry into instrument 
meteorological conditions, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). Contributing 
to the accident were (1) Hageland's allowance of routine use of the terrain inhibit switch for 
inhibiting the terrain awareness and warning system alerts and inadequate guidance for 
Page 2 of 6ANC17MA001
uninhibiting the alerts, which reduced the margin of safety, particularly in deteriorating 
visibility; (2) Hageland's inadequate crew resource management (CRM) training; (3) the 
Federal Aviation Administration's failure to ensure that Hageland's approved CRM training 
contained all the required elements of Title 14 
Code of Federal Regulations
 135.330; and (4) 
Hageland's CFIT avoidance ground training, which was not tailored to the company's 
operations and did not address current CFIT-avoidance technologies.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=94121
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
