Analysis 
The commercial pilot of the jet reported that he initially requested that 100 lbs of fuel be added 
to both fuel tanks. During the subsequent preflight inspection, the pilot decided that more fuel 
was needed, so he requested that the airplane's fuel tanks be topped off with fuel. However, he 
did not confirm the fuel levels or check the fuel gauges before takeoff. He departed on the flight 
and did not check the fuel gauges until about 1 hour after takeoff. He stated that, at that time, 
the fuel gauges were showing about 900-1,000 lbs of fuel per side, and he realized that the fuel 
tanks had not been topped off as requested. He reduced engine power to conserve fuel and to 
increase the airplane's flight endurance while he continued to his destination. When the fuel 
gauges showed about 400-500 lbs of fuel per side, the low fuel lights for both wing fuel tanks 
illuminated. The pilot reported to air traffic control that the airplane was low on fuel and 
diverted the flight to the nearest airport. The pilot reported that the airplane was high and fast 
on the visual approach for landing. He misjudged the height above the ground and later stated 
that the airplane "landed very hard." The airplane's left main landing gear and nose gear 
collapsed and the airplane veered off the runway, resulting in substantial damage to the left 
wing. The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to fly a stabilized approach and his inadequate landing flare, which resulted 
in a hard landing. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to ensure that the airplane 
was properly serviced with fuel before departing on the flight.

Factual Information
On December 4, 2016, about 1853 mountain standard time, a Cessna Citation 500, N332SE, 
sustained substantial damage during a hard landing and runway excursion at the Gunnison-
Crested Butte Airport (GUC), Gunnison, Colorado. The pilot, the sole occupant, was not 
injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of the 14 
Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a business flight. Night visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed at the time of the accident, and the flight was on an instrument flight plan. The flight 
departed the San Jose International Airport (SJC), San Jose, California, about 1616 and 
Pueblo, Colorado, was the destination.
The pilot reported that he originally requested that the fixed base operator (FBO) at SJC put 
100 gallons of jet fuel in each wing fuel tank. Later during his preflight, the pilot decided that 
more fuel was needed, so he went back into the FBO and requested that the airplane's fuel 
tanks be topped off with fuel. The pilot was still in the FBO when he saw the lineman fuel the 
airplane from the fuel truck. He paid for the fuel without looking at the receipt and then 
proceeded out to the airplane. The pilot reported that he did not recheck the fuel gauges before 
departing SJC. 
The pilot reported that he departed on the flight, but it was not until about an hour after 
takeoff that he checked the fuel gauges. He stated that the fuel gauges were showing about 900 
to 1,000 lbs of fuel per side, and he realized that the fuel tanks had not been topped off with 
fuel. He reduced the throttles to conserve fuel and to increase the airplane's flight endurance 
while he continued the flight to Pueblo, Colorado. 
The pilot reported that when the fuel gauges showed about 400 to 500 lbs of fuel per side, the 
low fuel lights for both wing fuel tanks illuminated. About 1840, the pilot reported to air traffic 
control (ATC) that the airplane was low on fuel and asked to land at the nearest airport. ATC 
provided radar vectors to GUC and initially cleared the flight for the ILS runway 6 approach. 
During the approach, the pilot reported that he had the runway in sight and ATC cleared the 
flight for a visual approach. 
The pilot reported that the airplane was high and fast on the approach. At 500 ft above ground 
level, the airspeed was about 120 knots. He misjudged the runway and the height above the 
ground and he stated, "I landed very hard on runway 24." During touchdown, the airplane 
bounced and then impacted the runway. The airplane's left main landing gear and nose gear 
collapsed and the airplane veered off the runway, resulting in substantial damage to the left 
wing. The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane 
that would have precluded normal operation. 
At 1856, the surface weather observation at GUC was: wind 340 degrees at 4 knots; visibility 10 
miles; sky condition few clouds at 7,500 ft; temperature -8 degrees C; dew point -13 degrees C; 
altimeter 30.08 inches of mercury.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
