Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Midland, VA
Accident Number:
GAA17CA139
Date & Time:
12/02/2016, 1630 EST 
Registration:
N4149R
Aircraft:
PIPER PA46
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Hard landing
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The pilot receiving instruction reported that, during an annual insurance flight review, he was 
told to perform a short-field landing for the final landing. The flight instructor told him to be 
"50 ft. over the numbers at 75 KIAS [knots indicated airspeed], then go to flight idle, push the 
nose down, and land short." On short final, the pilot obtained the target altitude and airspeed, 
then reduced the power to flight idle, and the airplane dropped rapidly. He advanced the power 
lever, but the turbine-powered engine was slow to respond due to the spool-up lag, and the 
airplane landed hard and bounced. The pilot reported they taxied back to the hangar with no 
further incident.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The substantial damage was discovered later during a Federal Aviation Administration 
evaluation for repairs for a ferry permit. The ferry permit was submitted after receiving an 
engineering evaluation on the structure of the fuselage to allow the company to fly the airplane 
to a more appropriate repair station.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
The flight manual for the PA-46-350P states: "for a short field technique, flaps are to be full 
down, airspeed 78 KIAS, throttle as required. Once over the obstacle on final, throttle reduced 
to idle. After touchdown, brakes maximum."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:

The pilot's improper landing flare and subsequent hard landing while demonstrating a short-
field landing and the flight instructor's delayed remedial action.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=94716
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
