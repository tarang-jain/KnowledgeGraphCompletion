Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On June 1, 2016, about 2046 central daylight time, a Cessna 150K, N5679G, collided in-flight 
with a steel silo in Penwell, Texas. The pilot, the sole occupant on board, was fatally injured. 
The airplane was destroyed. The airplane was registered to and operated by LM Air Patrol 
Service, Inc., Midland, Texas, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as 
a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no 
flight plan had been filed. The local flight originated from Odessa Airport-Schlemeyer Field 
(ODO), Odessa, Texas, about 2000.
According to LM Air Patrol Service, the pilot was their employee and had been hired to provide 
aerial pipeline patrol services. He had flown the airplane on a pipeline patrol mission earlier 
that day and had secured the airplane about 1500. That evening, the pilot took the airplane 
without the company's permission. According to the Midland, Texas, Police Department's 
report, the pilot telephoned his wife and told her he was en route to the hangar and was going 
to kill himself. She alerted her husband's employer, who in turn alerted the Midland Police 
Department. The airplane was flying eastbound when it struck a 138-foot tall silo at the Cemex 
plant, located at 16501 W. Murphy St. in Penwell, Texas.
PERSONNEL (CREW) INFORMATION
The 45-yeard-old pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with airplane single/multiengine and 
instrument ratings. His last medical certificate, dated February 14, 2015, contained the 
following: "Medical certificate denied. Multiple alcohol-related events. Certificate surrendered 
by airman on 04/06/2016."
According to LM Air Patrol Service, the pilot had logged a total of 5,359 flight hours, of which 
450 hours were in the Cessna 150 and 2,600 hours were in multiengine aircraft. In the last 90 
and 30 days, the pilot had logged about 300 and 100 hours respectively, and had logged 5 
hours in the last 24 hours.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
N5679G, serial number 15071179, a model 150K, was manufactured by the Cessna Aircraft 
Company in 1969. According to LM Air Patrol Service, It was modified and powered by a 
Continental O-320-E2D engine, rated at 150 horsepower, driving a McCauley 2-blade, all-
metal, fixed pitch propeller (model number 1C172/TM7458). The last annual inspection was 
accomplished on June 15, 2015, at an airframe total time of 3,987 hours. The engine had 
accrued 1,396 hours since major overhaul.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
The following pertinent weather observation was recorded at Odessa Airport-Schlemeyer Field 
(ODO), Odessa, Texas, at 2053 CDT: Wind, 040ºat 18 knots; visibility, 10 miles; sky condition, 
Page 3 of 6CEN16LA203
few clouds at 6,500 feet, scattered clouds at 8,000 feet; temperature, 22º Celsius (C.),; dew 
point 15º; altimeter setting, 29.92 inches of mercury. Remarks: Lightning distant all quadrants.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
An autopsy was performed by the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office. According to its 
report, death was attributed to "massive blunt force trauma . . . consistent with history of
light aircraft flown into structure (cement plant tower). No notable natural disease" was noted. 
The manner of death was "consistent with suicide."
Toxicology screens were conducted by both FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI) and the 
Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office. According to CAMI's report, carbon monoxide and 
cyanide tests were not performed, but 133 (mg/dL, mg/hg) ethanol was detected in brain tissue 
and 131 (mg/dL, mg/hg) ethanol was detected in muscle tissue. In addition, 0.036 (ug/ml, 
ug/g) alprazolam was detected in liver tissue and lung tissue (no quantity given in the latter), 
1.961 (ug/ml, ug/g) butalbital was detected in liver tissue, 0.933 (ug/ml, ug/g) butalbital was 
detected in lung tissue, and metoprolol detected in Lung and liver tissue (no quantities given). 
According to the Tarrant County's toxicology report, the pilot's muscle tissue was positive for 
ethanol (0.030 g/dL), benzodiazepine, and alprazolam (117 ng/mL)
According to FAA's Forensic Toxicology Drug Information and FAA's Research Medical Officer, 
Alprazolam (Xanax®, Xanax® XR and Niravam®) is a prescription medication used in the 
treatment of panic and anxiety disorders. It is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines. 
The side effects of alprazolam are typical of benzodiazepines and include sedation, impaired 
coordination and muscle relaxation, and may impair mental and/or physical ability required 
for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery); 
therefore, "use could possibly represent a violation of 14 CFR Part 61.53(a), Part 91.17(a)(3) 
and/or Part 67." Butalbital (Esgic®, Fiorinal®, Fioricet®) is commonly used in combination 
with other drugs, such as acetaminophen and caffeine, to treat mild to moderate pain, 
migraines and tension headaches, and may impair mental and/or physical ability required for 
the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). 
"This medication is disqualifying for aeromedical certification; therefore, use could possibly 
represent a violation of 14 CFR Part 61.53(a), Part 91.17(a)(3) and/or Part 67." Metoprolol 
(Lopressor®, Toprol® XL) is a prescription medication and beta-adrenergic receptor 
antagonist, or 'beta blocker,' used in the treatment of hypertension and certain arrhythmias.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
