Analysis   
The solo student pilot reported that, while on final approach following a cross-country flight, 
he experienced what felt like a down draft or wind shear. The airplane touched down hard on 
the runway, bounced, and on the second touchdown, the nosewheel impacted the surface first. 
The student pilot taxied the airplane to the ramp without further incident. 
Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed substantial damage to the 
firewall. 
The student pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures 
with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
A review of recorded data from the automated weather observation station located on the 
airport revealed that, about 5 minutes before the accident, the wind was 040° at 5 knots. The 
airplane landed on runway 30.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
