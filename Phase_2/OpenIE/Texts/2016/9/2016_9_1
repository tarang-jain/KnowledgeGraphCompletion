Substantial
Defining Event:
Abrupt maneuver

6 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Public Aircraft
Analysis   
The pilot was landing the helicopter on a nose-up slope when he "noticed the helicopter started 
to tilt aft." As the pilot "immediately" increased collective pitch and applied forward cyclic to 
abort the landing, three of the four main rotor blades struck the wire strike protection system 
on the cabin roof, which resulted in substantial damage to the blades. Representatives from the 
helicopter manufacturer examined the helicopter, replaced the three damaged rotor blades, 
and then returned the helicopter to service. According to the pilot, there were no mechanical 
deficiencies with the helicopter that would have prevented normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's overcontrolling of the helicopter during an aborted slope landing from a hover, 
which resulted in a main rotor blade strike.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=94004
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
