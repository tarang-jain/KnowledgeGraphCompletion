Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Ponca City, OK
Accident Number:
CEN16LA184
Date & Time:
05/01/2016, 1130 CDT 
Registration:
N8619G
Aircraft:
CESSNA 150F
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Part(s) separation from AC
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot stated that, during the landing flare at the conclusion of a local flight, the 
airplane's nose "shot up drastically." The pilot "gently" pressed forward on the controls to 
lower the nose, and the airplane pitched down and impacted the runway. Examination of the 
airplane revealed that a bolt that attached the left elevator to the control system was not 
installed, and the FAA inspector reported that the bolt was found undamaged inside the 
elevator tip. According to the pilot, maintenance personnel had recently removed the left 
elevator, and it is likely that they failed to properly secure the bolt when they reinstalled the 
elevator.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Maintenance personnel's improper installation of the elevator bolt, which resulted in a loss of 
elevator control during landing.
Findings
Aircraft
Elevator control system - Incorrect service/maintenance (Cause)
Personnel issues
Repair - Maintenance personnel (Cause)
Post maintenance inspection - Maintenance personnel (Cause)

Factual Information
On May 1, 2016, about 1130 central daylight time, a Cessna 150F, N8619G, experienced a loss 
of pitch control during landing flare and impacted runway 35 at Ponca City Regional Airport, 
Ponca City, Oklahoma. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the firewall. The pilot 
sustained serious injuries and the passenger was uninjured. The airplane was operated by the 
pilot under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight that was not operating 
on a flight plan. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The 
local flight originated from PNC about 1045.
The pilot stated that he performed a "full" preflight inspection of the airplane prior to 
departing for a pleasure flight. The flight returned without incident for an approach for landing 
to the airport. During landing flare on runway 35 and about 1-2 feet above runway, the airplane 
"shot up drastically". The airplane climbed about 10-20 feet, the pilot "gently" applied forward 
control pressure on the control yoke, and the airplane "instantly" pitched down and impacted 
the runway. The pilot stated that as he waited for an ambulance, he saw the left elevator was 
separated from the horizontal stabilizer.
An airplane maintenance record entry dated November 9, 2015, shows that an annual 
inspection had been performed and that the bearing in the elevator bearing crank assembly 
was "reset" by an airframe and powerplant mechanic with inspection authorization. The 
airplane accumulated about 25 hours of flight time after the annual inspection.
Post-accident examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
inspector revealed that a bolt that links the left elevator to the control system was missing. The 
bolt was found inside the left elevator tip. The FAA Inspector reported that there was an 
improper reinstallation of the elevator, which resulted in it coming loose.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
