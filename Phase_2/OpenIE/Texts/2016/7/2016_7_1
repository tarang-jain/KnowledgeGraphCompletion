Accident Number:
CEN16LA242
Date & Time:
07/01/2016, 2206 CDT 
Registration:
N236SC
Aircraft:
CZECH AIRCRAFT WORKS SPOL SRO 
SPORTCRUISER
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Landing gear collapse
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The sport pilot was conducting a personal local flight at night. The pilot reported that he was 
unable to locate the destination airport because it was dark. The airplane was low on fuel, so he 
decided to land the airplane on an interstate highway. During the landing roll, the airplane's 
right wing hit a wire road divider post, which resulted in substantial damage to the airplane. 
The pilot stated that the airplane did not have any mechanical failures during the flight. A 
postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical 
malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate flight planning and navigation for a flight at night, which resulted in his 
having to conduct a precautionary landing on an interstate highway due to low fuel and 
impacting the post of a wire road divider. 
Findings
Personnel issues
Flight planning/navigation - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Dark - Effect on personnel
Wall/barricade - Contributed to outcome

Factual Information
**This report was modified on August 16, 2016. Please see the docket for this accident to view 
the original report.**
On July 1, 2016, about 2206 central daylight time, a Czech Aircraft Works Sportcruiser, 
N236SC, sustained substantial damage during an off airport landing on Interstate Highway 35 
(I-35) near Wyoming, Minnesota. The sport pilot, the sole occupant, received minor injuries. 
The airplane was owned and operated by the pilot under the provisions of the Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the 
time of the flight, which was not on a flight plan. The flight departed the Cambridge Municipal 
Airport (CBG), Cambridge, Minnesota, about 2000 on a local flight. 
The pilot stated to a Federal Aviation Administration inspector that he could not find CBG 
because it was dark. The airplane was low on fuel and he could not see an airport beacon, so he 
landed the airplane on a road, which turned out to be I-35. During the landing roll, he 
attempted to maneuver the airplane into the ditch between the northbound and southbound 
lanes of the highway to avoid the traffic on the highway. The airplane's right wing hit the post 
of a wire road divider causing substantial damage to the airplane. The pilot stated that the 
airplane did not have any mechanical failures while airborne. 
A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical 
malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=93524
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
