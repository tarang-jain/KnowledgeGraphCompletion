GAA16CA358
Date & Time:
07/01/2016, 1400 MDT 
Registration:
N52071
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Low altitude operation/event
Injuries:
3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The pilot reported that during an "introductory flight" for two passengers, he departed the 
airport and flew into a canyon where the airplane encountered an "unforeseen immense 
downdraft". He further reported that he immediately initiated a right turn to exit the canyon 
but it became clear that a turn was not possible due to the mountainous terrain. Subsequently, 
the pilot decided to make an emergency landing on a mountain road. After touchdown the 
airplane skidded off the dirt road and down an embankment. A post-crash fire resulted in 
substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings.
The pilot reported that there were no pre impact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
As a safety recommendation the pilot reported that he should have given himself more altitude 
before entering the canyon.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to fly into a canyon without sufficient room to reverse course if necessary, 
which resulted in an emergency landing, loss of directional control, collision with terrain, and a 
post-crash fire.

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=93538
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
