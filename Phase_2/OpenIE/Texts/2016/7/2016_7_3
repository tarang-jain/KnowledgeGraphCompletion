Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Maryville, MO
Accident Number:
GAA16CA357
Date & Time:
07/01/2016, 1912 CDT 
Registration:
N8704M
Aircraft:
BEECH 23
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Controlled flight into terr/obj 
(CFIT)
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that on final approach to runway 17, he was "distracted" by the runway 
composition and dimensions. The pilot reported that he identified the high tension power lines 
just before impact. He recalled that when he saw the power lines he "pulled up" in an attempt 
to climb, however it was too late, the propeller and engine cowl struck the power lines and the 
airplane slid down the power line wires toward the ground and came to rest in a corn field. The 
airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage aft of the cabin, and the empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no mechanical failures or anomalies with any portion of the 
airplane during the flight that would have prevented normal flight operations.
The Airport/Facility Directory states the dimensions and composition of the runway, displaced 
threshold and the high tension power lines as:
The first 630 feet of the runway is gravel and turf, and the width is 60 feet. The next 1300 feet 
of runway is a 14 foot wide section of concrete with 18 feet of turf on both sides of the concrete. 
The final 1120 feet of runway is a 12 to 25 foot wide section of gravel and asphalt chips, with 
12.5 to17.5 feet of turf on both sides of the gravel and asphalt chips. The displaced threshold is 
marked with 5 tires on each side of the runway. High tension power line wires are about 1200 
feet north of the runway threshold and do not have any safety markings. The power lines that 
the airplane struck intersect and cross the approach end of runway 17 at approximately 30 
degrees. Furthermore, the power lines are depicted on the FAA Aeronautical Chart for the 
airport.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Page 2 of 5GAA16CA357
The pilot's failure to see and avoid power lines on approach during landing, resulting a power 
line strike, uncontrolled descent, and collision with terrain. Contributing to the accident was 
the pilot's inadequate pre-flight planning.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
