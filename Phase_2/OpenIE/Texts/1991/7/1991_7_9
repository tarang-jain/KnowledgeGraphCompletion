Analysis 
THE LANDING GEAR COLLAPSED DURING THE LANDING ROLL. THE PILOT HAD 
ACCUMULATED A TOTAL OF 27 HOURS IN THE AIRPLANE AFTER RECEIVING A 
MULTIENGINE RATING. EXAMINATION OF THE AIRPLANE AT THE SCENE SHOWED 
THE GEAR HANDLE IN THE DOWN POSITION AND THE LANDING GEAR CIRCUIT 
BREAKER POPPED. DAMAGE TO THE GEAR DOORS AND GEAR ACTUATING RODS 
INDICATED THAT THE PILOT SELECTED GEAR UP INSTEAD OF FLAPS UP BEFORE THE 
GEAR STRUT SQUAT SWITCHES ACTIVATED TO PREVENT THE GEAR FROM 
RETRACTING. THE PILOT THEN SELECTED THE GEAR DOWN POSITION BUT THE 
WEIGHT OF THE AIRPLANE PREVENTED THE GEAR FROM EXTENDING, POPPING THE 
GEAR MOTOR CIRCUIT BREAKER. PRIOR TO OPERATING THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE, 
IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS, THE PILOT OPERATED A TAILWHEEL, FIXED GEAR 
AIRPLANE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE PILOT'S IMPROPER USE OF THE LANDING GEAR RETRACTION BY SELECTING

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
