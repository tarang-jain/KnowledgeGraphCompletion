Analysis 
THE PILOT AND TWO PASSENGERS WERE FLYING TO AN AIRPORT TO PICK UP A 
FRIEND. NIGHT VMC PREVAILED. WITNESSES OBSERVED THE AIRPLANE FLYING AT 
ABOUT 300 FT AGL AT VARIOUS POSITIONS OVER THE CITY, VARYING HEADINGS, 
AND SOMETIMES CIRCLING. ONE WITNESS STATED THAT THE PILOT 'SEEMED LIKE 
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS GOING.'  THE AIRPLANE THEN PROCEEDED 
TOWARD THE MIDFIELD POINT OF THE AIRPORT ON A NORTHERLY HEADING. IT 
COLLIDED WITH PINE TREES, THEN FELL INTO THE ROOF OF A CHURCH LOCATED 
150 FEET FARTHER NORTH. THE AIRCRAFT, AND CHURCH, WERE DESTROYED BY 
FIRE. THE FUEL SELECTOR VALVE WAS FOUND IN THE 'LEFT AUX' TANK POSITION; 
HOWEVER, AUX TANKS WERE TO BE USED IN LEVEL FLIGHT ONLY. ACTUATOR 
SETTINGS INDICATED THE GEAR WAS DOWN & THE FLAPS WERE UP. PROP 
SIGNATURES INDICATED PROP ROTATION IN A POWER PRODUCING MODE AT 
IMPACT. THE RUNWAY LIGHTS FOR RWY 9/27 WERE ON AT THE TIME, AND THE 
AIRCRAFT'S NORTHERLY HEADING WAS NOT ALIGNED WITH ANY RUNWAY. THE 
LOCATION OF THE AIRPORT DID NOT REQUIRE THE CITY TO BE OVERFLOWN. 
Probable Cause and Findings

FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO ATTAIN PROPER RUNWAY ALIGNMENT AND TO MAINTAIN 
PROPER ALTITUDE.  RELATED FACTORS WERE: DARKNESS AND THE PILOT

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
