Analysis 
 THE PILOT OF A HIGH WING, SINGLE ENGINE AIRPLANE WAS FLYING A PUBLISHED 
ILS APPROACH AS GUIDANCE TO A RUNWAY HE INTENDED TO LAND ON.  THE PILOT 
STATED THAT HE ANNOUNCED HIS POSITION THREE TIMES DURING THE 
APPROACH. THE PILOT STATED THAT HE HEARD THE PILOT OF ANOTHER AIRPLANE 
ANNOUNCE HIS POSITION ON BASE LEG FOR THE SAME RUNWAY HE WAS 
INTENDING TO LAND ON.  HE STATED THAT HE COULD NOT SEE THE OTHER 
AIRPLANE AND DID NOT ASK THE PILOT OF THAT AIRPLANE TO RE-STATE HIS 
POSITION.  HE CONTINUED INBOUND AND, DURING THE FLARE FOR LANDING, A 
LOW WING AIRPLANE LANDED ON TOP OF HIS AIRPLANE. AN ON-SCENE 
INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT BOTH AIRPLANES WERE WHITE IN OVERALL 
COLOR WITH DARK TRIM.  THE TERRAIN BOTH AIRPLANES WERE OPERATING OVER 
WAS SNOW COVERED. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE FAILURE OF BOTH PILOTS TO MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION FROM EACH 
OTHER. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THIS ACCIDENT WERE AN INADEQUATE VISUAL 
LOOKOUT BY BOTH PILOTS AND THE PILOT-IN-COMMAND'S FAILURE TO FOLLOW 
PROCEDURES AND DIRECTIVES.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
