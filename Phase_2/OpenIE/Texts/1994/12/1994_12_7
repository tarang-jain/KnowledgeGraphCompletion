Analysis 
THE PILOT WAS CONDUCTING THE FOURTH TOUCH AND GO LANDING, UNDER THE 
SUPERVISION OF AN INSTRUCTOR PILOT, WHEN THE RIGHT MAIN LANDING GEAR 
FAILED. FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE OF THE LANDING GEAR THE AIRCRAFT VEERED 
RIGHT OF THE RUNWAY AND GROUND LOOPED. AN EXAMINATION OF THE LANDING 
GEAR REVEALED A PRE-EXISTING CRACK IN A WELD AREA. THE PILOT HAD 
RECENTLY PURCHASED THE AIRCRAFT.

Factual Information
 On December 3, 1994, at 1030 central standard time, a Howard DGA-15P, N88WT, was 
substantially damaged during landing at the Las Cruces, New Mexico, International Airport.  
The airplane, owned and operated by the commercial pilot, was on a local area dual 
instructional flight.  There was no flight plan filed and visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed.  Neither the pilot, the instructor, nor the two passengers were injured.
According to the owner, who had recently purchased the airplane, he was "acting as pilot-in-
command."  He and his flight instructor were doing touch and go landings on runway 30.  He 
stated that during the last landing he touched down at approximately "60 miles per hour 
(MPH)."  During the landing roll, at approximately 40 MPH, the "right main landing gear 
began to fail." As the gear began to collapse the airplane veered right and he and the instructor 
could not regain control using full left rudder and differential braking.  As the airplane 
departed the runway, it spun 720 degrees before the right main landing gear collapsed.  The 
flight had landed on runway 30 and the winds were reported as being 110 degrees at 4 knots.  
An examination of the aircraft, by a Federal Aviation Administration airworthiness inspector, 
revealed that control continuity existed and the braking system operated.  Inspection of the 
landing gear revealed evidence of pre-existing fractures in the gear structure.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
