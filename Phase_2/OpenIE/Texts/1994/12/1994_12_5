 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
     On December 3, 1994 at 0730 Alaska standard time, a wheel equipped Cessna 206 airplane, 
N5282U, registered to Vern L Loftstedt of Kenai, Alaska and operated by South Central Air also 
of Kenai, disappeared during a flight from Kenai to Homer, Alaska.  The non-scheduled air taxi 
flight, operating under 14 CFR Part 135, departed Kenai at 0655.  A visual flight rules flight 
plan was filed and the destination was Homer.  Kenai and Homer had visual meteorological 
conditions, however, there were snow showers en route.  Instrument meteorological conditions 
prevailed in the presumed accident area based upon the last radar returns provided by 
Anchorage Center.  The airline transport certificated pilot, the sole occupant, is missing and 
presumed fatal.  The airplane has not been recovered and is presumed to have crashed into 
Cook Inlet near Anchor Point, Alaska.
     According to information provided by the Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center, they 
tracked an aircraft that departed the Kenai Airport at the time the accident airplane departed.  
The airplane was "squawking code 1200" until 3 miles south of Kenai.  The radar returns then 
became primary target returns.  The primary target returns were followed and the returns 
ceased approximately 1 to 2 miles off shore near Anchor Point abeam Happy Valley.  The 
airplane never reached Homer.  Search and Rescue has not produced any wreckage or ELT 
signals.

METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
     According to Kenai Automated Flight Service Station, the Pilot received a weather briefing 
through the Direct User Access Terminal System (DUATS).  The Pilot indicated the route of 
flight to be briefed as Kenai to Homer, direct.  A direct route of flight from Kenai to Homer 
follows a 160 degree magnetic course. 
     The DUATS system showed the Kenai weather at 0546 as Measured 5000 overcast, 5 miles 
visibility with light snow, temperature 20 degrees fahrenheit, dewpoint 18 degrees fahrenheit, 
wind from 020 degrees at 8 knots, altimeter setting 29.71 inches of mercury.  The remarks 
section showed conditions lower to the southeast and higher to the northeast.
     The Homer weather, hourly observation taken at 0555 showed 1500 feet scattered, 
estimated 4500 feet overcast, visibility 12 miles, temperature 37 degrees fahrenheit, dewpoint, 
31 degrees fahrenheit, wind from 160 degrees at 12 knots, altimeter setting 29.65 inches of 
mercury. Homer is located approximately 15 miles east of the presumed accident area.
     The DUATS system showed the pilot there were adverse weather conditions available for 
viewing.  The Pilot selected the option to not view the adverse weather conditions.
     The route of flight, shown by the Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center primary target 
information which coincided with the departure time of the accident airplane, was down the 
shoreline of Cook Inlet.  This route aligns with a magnetic heading of 180 degrees.
     Search and rescue pilots reported many snow showers in the area between Kenai and Homer 
during their search for the airplane.
     The terminal forecasts for Kenai showed occasional visibility to 1 mile in light snow, and for 
some visibility down to 3 miles in light rain and fog.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
