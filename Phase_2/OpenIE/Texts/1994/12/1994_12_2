Factual Information
 On December 2, 1994, approximately 1725 central standard time, a Piper PA-32-260, N2LK, 
was substantially damaged during a precautionary landing near Goldthwaite, Texas.  The 
private pilot received minor injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.
The following is based on interviews with the pilot and the pilot operator report.  The pilot had 
flown from Chino, California, to Deming, New Mexico.  At Deming, the airplane was refueled 
and the pilot obtained a weather briefing, he was informed that he would be experiencing 
deteriorating ceilings along his proposed route of flight, before filing a VFR flight plan to Waco, 
Texas.  En route to Waco, the pilot was in radio contact with Fort Worth Air Route Traffic 
Control Center (ARTCC).  When he was about 100 miles from Waco, he began a descent due to 
deteriorating ceilings and elected to divert to Brownwood, Texas, his alternate.  Due to 
deteriorating weather and reduced lighting conditions, he was unable to locate the Brownwood 
Airport and decided to make a precautionary landing in a cow pasture.  During the landing roll, 
the airplane struck an barbed wire fence and nosed over into a creek.  The pilot reported 
weather was partial obscuration, 3,500 feet overcast, 3 miles visibility in fog and drizzle.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
