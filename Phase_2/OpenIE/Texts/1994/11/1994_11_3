Factual Information
 On November 1, 1994, about  1200 central standard time, a Rockwell S-2R, N8456V, 
registered to Kimmel Flying Service, operating as a 14 CFR part 91 ferry flight, experienced 
smoke in the cockpit during cruise flight at about 1,000 feet msl. The smoke was entering the 
cockpit from beneath the floor. The pilot made a precautionary landing to a harvested cotton 
field in the vicinity of Madison, Mississippi. On landing rollout, the pilot observed a tree line 
and applied brakes, the airplane nosed down on its propeller, and rocked back on its landing 
gear. The pilot exited the airplane, opened a panel on the right side, and observed dark smoke 
with an electrical smell. He moved away from the airplane, and the airplane was consumed by 
fire. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The airline 
transport-rated pilot reported no injuries. The flight originated from Hollandale, Mississippi, 
about 20 minutes before the accident.
     Examination of the wreckage by the FAA revealed there was no evidence of an in-flight fire. 
The origin of the postcrash fire, and the source of the smoke reported by the pilot was not 
determined.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
