Location:
LEANDER, LA
Accident Number:
FTW94LA253
Date & Time:
08/01/1994, 1345 CDT 
Registration:
N9062G
Aircraft:

Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
THE HELICOPTER EXPERIENCED A COMPLETE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER DURING AN 
IGNITION FIRE CONTROL FLIGHT AT 100 FEET AGL. THE PILOT ENTERED 
AUTOROTATION TO THE ONLY AVAILABLE FORCED LANDING AREA. THE AIRCRAFT 
TOUCHED DOWN HARD AND SUSTAINED STRUCTURAL DAMAGE. POSTACCIDENT 
EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REALED THAT BOTH CONNECTING ROD BOLTS IN 
THE #1 CYLINDER WERE FRACTURED. A SAFETY BOARD METALLURGICAL 
EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT ONE OF THE CONNECTING ROD BOLTS HAD FAILED 
DUE TO A PREEXISTING FATIGUE CRACK THAT EMANATED FROM THE HEAD-TO-
SHOULDER FILLET RADIUS OF THE BOLT. THE ENGINE WAS LAST OVERHAULED IN 
1970. THE ENGINE MANUFACTURER ADVISES IN THEIR SERVICE INSTRUCTION 
LETTER DATED 7/1/92 THAT 'ALL ENGINES THAT DO NOT ACCUMULATE THE 
RECOMMENDED TIME OPERATING HOURS BETWEEN OVERHAULS IN A TWELVE 
YEAR PERIOD, MUST BE OVERHAULED DURING THE TWELFTH YEAR.' TEXTRON 
LYCOMING MANDATORY SERVICE BULLETIN NO. 240M REQUIRES REPLACEMENT OF 
THE CONNECTING ROD BOLTS AND NUTS EACH TIME THE ENGINE IS SUBJECT TO 
OVERHAUL. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
INADEQUATE MAINTENANCE AND A FATIGUE FAILURE OF A #1 CYLINDER 
CONNECTING ROD BOLT. A FACTOR WAS THE LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN 
AVAILABLE TO THE PILOT FOR A FORCED LANDING.

Factual Information
 On August 1, 1994, at 1345 central daylight time, a Hughes 269A helicopter, N9062G, was 
substantially damaged during a forced landing near Leander, Louisiana.  The commercial pilot, 
sole occupant of the helicopter, was not injured.  The helicopter, owned and operated by ARk-
LA-TX Helicopters Inc., of Rodessa, Louisiana, was being operated under Title 14 CFR Part 137 
at the time of the accident.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the aerial ignition 
fire control flight for which a flight plan was not filed.  The flight originated from an airstrip 
near the accident site, approximately 15 minutes prior to the accident. 
According to the operator, the helicopter was conducting aerial ignition fire control operations 
at altitudes below 100 feet AGL when the engine lost power without warning.  The pilot stated 
that due to his low altitude, he lowered the collective and entered an autorotation as soon as he 
sensed the loss of power.  The area that he was operating over was covered by stumps and 
downed trees, so he attempted to touchdown with minimal or no forward speed, and the 
helicopter landed hard. 
Post accident examination of the wreckage by the operator and the FAA inspector revealed 
Structural damage to the airframe, tailboom, and main rotor blades.  Post accident 
examination of the Lycoming HIO-360-B1A engine revealed that both connecting rod bolts for 
the number one cylinder failed while the engine was operating at 2,900 RPM.
According to the records, the engine had accumulated a total of 3,307 hours since new, with 
one engine overhaul performed in 1970, 936 hours prior to the accident.  The recommended 
operating hours between overhauls for this engine is 1,500; however, the engine manufacturer 
advises on their Service Instruction Letter dated July 1, 1992, that "all engines that do not 
accumulate the recommended time operating hours between overhauls in a twelve year period, 
must be overhauled during the twelfth year."   
Examination of the failed engine components was conducted by the Board's Materials 
Laboratory in Washington, D.C.  The failure of the "trail" connecting rod bolts from the 
number one cylinder was a result of preexisting fatigue crack that initiated in the head-to-
shoulder fillet radius of the bolt.  See the enclosed Metallurgist's Factual Report for details of 
the examination.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
