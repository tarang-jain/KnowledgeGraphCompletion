Analysis 
WHILE CONDUCTING A VISUAL APPROACH TO A LANDING ZONE AT 12,800 FEET MSL 
IN MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN, THE PILOT MADE A RIGHT TURN FROM DOWN WIND TO 
BASE TO FINAL WHICH PLACED THE HELICOPTER IN A DOWN SLOPE WIND 
CONDITION. THE HELICOPTER SETTLED, TURNED TO THE LEFT AROUND THE 
VERTICAL AXIS, AND IMPACTED THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN BELOW THE LANDING 
ZONE. THE TAIL BOOM SEPARATED AND THE FUSELAGE ROLLED DOWN THE 
MOUNTAIN SIDE DURING WHICH TIME THE PASSENGERS WERE EJECTED.  THE 
INVESTIGATION PROVIDED NO EVIDENCE OF PREIMPACT FAILURE OR 
MALFUNCTION.  MAXIMUM GROSS WEIGHT WAS 4960 POUNDS.  ACTUAL GROSS 
WEIGHT WAS 4375 POUNDS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
FAILURE BY THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT. FACTORS WERE 
UNFAVORABLE WINDS AND IMPROPER APPROACH PLANNING.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On April 1, 1994, at 1145 mountain standard time, an Aerospatiale AS350 B2 helicopter, 
N59715, impacted terrain approximately 7 miles southwest of Telluride, Colorado.  Of the six 
persons on board, one received serious injuries, four minor injuries and one no injuries.  The 
helicopter sustained substantial damage.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for this 
commercial, on demand, CFR part 135 air taxi flight and no flight plan was filed.  
According to the pilot, the flight originated from a landing zone known as Bridal Vail Falls at 
1130.  The purpose of the flight was to deliver the passengers to Waterfall Canyon landing zone 
at 12,800 feet above mean sea level for skiing.  The pilot stated that he overflew the landing 
zone headed in a westerly direction and made a right hand turn to final approach.  The landing 
zone, which was being used, was located in a saddle with rising terrain to the north and south.  
A passenger was taking a video at the time of the approach and it indicates that a right hand 
turn was made which placed the helicopter to the southwest and below the rising terrain to the 
north of the landing zone.  The person taking the video dropped the camera so the accident 
sequence was not taped.  (See attached pilot supplied diagrams.)
Interviews provided information that as the helicopter was turning final, it began to settle and 
turn to the left around the vertical axis.  According to the pilot, the helicopter rotated one or 
possibly two times with right pedal having no effect.  Witnesses provided information that the 
turns were not rapid.  The helicopter impacted the slope below the landing zone and rolled 
down the 40 degree slope.  Snow depth on the slope was approximately 4 feet.
Available information indicates that the occupants were thrown from the helicopter during the 
roll down the slope; however, no evidence was found of restraint system failure or malfunction.  
A seating diagram is attached.
PERSONAL INFORMATION
According to information provided on the enclosed National Transportation Safety Board 
Form 6120.1/2, the pilot had approximately 3,900 hours flight time in helicopters.  About 500 
hours was in this make and model.  No evidence was found during the investigation which 
documented the amount of mountain flying experience of the pilot or if he had any formal 
mountain flying training.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
According to the manufacturer's information, maximum certified gross weight for this aircraft 
was 4,960 pounds.  Estimated weight at the time of the accident was 4,375 pounds based on 
the weights provided in the attached seating diagram.  
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
According to the pilot, there were scattered clouds at 5,000 feet above ground level and the 
wind was from the northeast at 10 to 15 mph in the vicinity of the accident site.  Wind from the 
direction indicated would place the helicopter in a down slope wind while the turn to final 
approach was being executed.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The tail boom separated from the aircraft and was located below and to the north of the 
Page 4 of 6FTW94FA114
landing zone approximately 150 feet.  Rotational marks were found in the tail rotor drive 
tunnel at the separation point.  The tail boom separation point at the fuselage junction was 
buckled inward on the left and bottom and rotational twisting was present at the separation 
point of the tail rotor drive shaft at the transmission deck exit.  The tail boom and tail rotor 
system incurred minor damage.
The remainder of the helicopter was scattered down the slope from the tail boom for a distance 
of approximately 300 feet.  The transmission remained attached and the main rotor blades 
fractured near the hub.  The left portion of the nose and fuselage top were crushed inward.
The engine separated from the airframe during the impact sequence.  It was later placed on a 
test cell and functioned normally.  (See attached engine report).
The two front seats separated from the aircraft with the separation point being in the 
composite support structure above the seat attach point.  The rear bench seat exhibited minor 
downward crushing of the support structure.
Examination of the helicopter during the course of the investigation provided no evidence of 
preimpact structural failure or system failure or malfunction.
ADDITIONAL DATA/INFORMATION
The wreckage was released to Mr. D. K. Jason, Jason and Associates, on June 13, 1994.  No 
parts were retained.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
