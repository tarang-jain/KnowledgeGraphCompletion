Factual Information
 On April 1, 1994, at 1820 central standard time, a Piper PA-28- 140, N3521K, was substantially 
damaged during a forced landing near San Angelo, Texas.  The private pilot and passenger 
were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight.
The pilot stated in the Pilot/Operator report that after takeoff the aircraft would not develop 
sufficient power to maintain altitude.  He further reported that he executed a forced landing in 
a field and that "on roll out, the wing tips struck a fence" west of the departure end of the 
runway. 
An examination of the aircraft by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector and the operator 
revealed that the muffler baffle had come lose.
The aircraft was released to the owner.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
