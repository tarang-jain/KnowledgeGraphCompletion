Factual Information
 On April 2, 1994, at 1915 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-38- 112, N2542L, collided with 
birds enroute to New Castle County Airport, Wilmington, Delaware.  The certificated private 
pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured while the airplane sustained substantial damage.  The 
personal flight was being operated under 14 CFR 91 and originated in Delaware.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed.
According to the pilot, it was a dark night and he was returning from a local flight.  He stated 
that he was descending out of 2000 feet MSL for 1100 feet MSL, and upon reaching 1800 feet 
MSL he heard a loud bang.  The pilot stated that he lost all electrical power and was unable to 
contact the tower.  The airplane struck a flock of birds and some of the birds were ingested into 
the airplane's engine air inlet as well as in the cockpit.  A landing was made without power due 
to loss of engine and electrical power.  The pilot also stated that he did not have any aileron 
control during the landing.  
Examination of the airplane by the FAA revealed that there were bird strikes to the right side 
battery case, firewall, and both wings.  According to the Airport Facilities Directory in the 
Airport Remarks, it states in part "birds on and in vicinity of airport."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
