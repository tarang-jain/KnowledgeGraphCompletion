Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
     On June 1, 1994, about 1458 eastern daylight time, an unregistered Maxair Aircraft 
Corporation MU532, crashed shortly after takeoff from a sod farm near Kissimmee, Florida, 
while on a 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the 
time and no flight plan was filed. The airplane was destroyed and the student pilot, the sole 
occupant, was fatally injured.  The flight originated about 5 minutes earlier.
     A witness reported seeing the airplane climb to about 150 feet after takeoff, then observed 
the airplane pitch nose down and impact the ground.  The witnesses could not hear any sounds 
from the engine because of noise nearby.  The airplane owner stated that the pilot did not have 
verbal or written permission to fly or operate the airplane.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
     Information pertaining to the first pilot is contained in the NTSB Factual Report-Aviation.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
     The airplane was not registered with the FAA and no logbooks were prepared for 
documenting maintenance.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
     Information pertaining to weather is contained in the NTSB Factual Report-Aviation.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT
     An on-scene investigation was conducted by the FAA which revealed that the airplane 
impacted the ground nose and right wing low.  The fuel quantity was determined to be 
sufficient to sustain engine operation and examination of the airframe revealed no evidence of 
flight control failure or malfunction.  The engine was removed at a later date and after 
replacement of impact damaged components, and minor adjustment of the points, the engine 
was started and found to operate normally.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL
     A postmortem examination was conducted on the pilot by William R. Anderson, M.D., 
Deputy Chief Medical Examiner, Orlando, Florida.  The cause of death was listed as aortic 
transection, secondary to blunt force deceleration injuries, resulting from aircraft crash.  
Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease with 75 percent and 50 percent stenosis were noted 
from the left anterior descending coronary artery and left circumflex coronary artery.  There 
was no evidence of acute myocardial necrosis.
     A toxicological analysis of specimens of the pilot was performed by the FAA Toxicology and 
Accident Research Laboratory. The results were negative for carbon monoxide, cyanide,  
volatiles, and tested drugs.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
