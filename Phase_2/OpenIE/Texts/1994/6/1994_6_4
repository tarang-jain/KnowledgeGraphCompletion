Analysis 
THE STUDENT PILOT REPORTED THAT HE USED HIS FATHER'S AIRPLANE TO 
PRACTICE FLYING IN PREPARATION FOR THE FAA FLIGHT EXAM.  HE LANDED ON A 
DIRT AIRSTRIP AND THEN ATTEMPTED TO TAKE OFF.  ACCORDING TO THE STUDENT, 
AS THE AIRPLANE WAS LIFTING OFF AT AN AIRSPEED OF ABOUT 70 KNOTS, THE 
AIRPLANE DRIFTED LEFT AND COLLIDED WITH A TREE NEAR THE RUNWAY.  THE 
PILOT HAD NOT RECEIVED DUAL FLIGHT INSTRUCTION IN 5 MONTHS, AND HAD NOT 
RECEIVED A LOGBOOK ENDORSEMENT AUTHORIZING SOLO FLYING IN 7 MONTHS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE STUDENT PILOT'S FAILURE TO PROPERLY ALIGN THE AIRPLANE'S FLIGHTPATH 
OVER THE RUNWAY DURING INITIAL CLIMB. A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR WAS THE 
STUDENT PILOT'S TOTAL LACK OF RECENT FLYING EXPERIENCE. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH OBJECT
Phase of Operation: TAKEOFF - INITIAL CLIMB
Findings
1. OBJECT - TREE(S)
2. (F) LACK OF RECENT TOTAL EXPERIENCE - PILOT IN COMMAND
3. (C) PROPER ALIGNMENT - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND

Factual Information
 On June 1, 1994, at 2000 Pacific daylight time, a Piper PA-28- 151, N32532, registered to the 
pilot's father, collided with a tree during initial climb from an uncontrolled dirt airstrip near 
Simi Valley, California.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the solo 
instructional flight, and no flight plan was filed.  The airplane was substantially damaged, and 
the student pilot was not injured.  The flight originated from the Santa Monica Municipal 
Airport, Santa Monica, California, at 1815.
The pilot reported to the National Transportation Safety Board that as the airplane was lifting 
off, at an airspeed of about 70 knots, he drifted left of the runway and the airplane's left wing 
collided with a tree.  Thereafter, the airplane spun around and hit the ground hard.  The 
emergency locator transmitter (ELT) activated, and the airplane came to a stop adjacent to the 
airstrip pointed in the opposite direction from takeoff.
According to the pilot, there were no mechanical problems with the airplane, and the accident 
was just his "pilot error."  Regarding the pilot's flying experience, the pilot reported that he had 
logged about 73.1 hours of dual flight instruction and about 16.5 hours of solo pilot flight time.  
The pilot reported that he last received a logbook endorsement for solo flying in November of 
1993.  His last flight in an airplane was in the accident airplane, and that flight was made with 
his flight instructor on January 12, 1994.
In the pilot's completed Aircraft Accident Report, NTSB Form 6120.1, he indicated that during 
the accident flight he had been practicing for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight 
examination.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
