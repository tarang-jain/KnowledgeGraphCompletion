Analysis 
AS AN INSTRUCTOR (CFI) & STUDENT IN A CESSNA 172 WERE MAKING TOUCH-&-GO'S 
ON RUNWAY 14R, A BM-4 PILOT TRANSMITTED ON UNICOM THAT HE WAS 
APPROACHING FROM THE WEST FOR A BASE ENTRY.  REPORTEDLY, THE CESSNA 
PILOTS WERE TRANSMITTING THEIR POSITIONS ON UNICOM, ALSO.  THE BM-4 
SUBSEQUENTLY TURNED BASE TO FINAL BEHIND THE CESSNA & WAS SEEN 
CONVERGING ON THE CESSNA IN DISTANCE & ALTITUDE. IMPACT OCCURRED ON 
SHORT FINAL.  WITNESSES SAID THE AIRPLANES REMAINED TOGETHER, ROTATED 
TO THE LEFT & DESCENDED VERTICALLY TO THE GROUND.  THE BM-4 COLOR WAS 
WHITE WITH YELLOW TRIM & THE CESSNA WAS COLORED WHITE WITH BROWN 
TRIM.   YELLOW PAINT TRANSFER WAS OBSERVED ON THE UPPER LEFT WING 
SURFACE, AFT CABIN SUPPORT POST & AFT WINDSHIELD OF THE CESSNA.  LEADING 
EDGE DAMAGE OF THE RIGHT WING OF THE BM-4 WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO 
THE WIDTH OF THE AFT CABIN WINDOW OF THE CESSNA.  AN IMPACT SIGNATURE 
MEASUREMENT AT THE OUTBOARD PORTION OF THE LEFT FLAP OF THE CESSNA 
WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE BM-4 RIGHT LANDING GEAR STRUT WIDTH.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
INADEQUATE VISUAL LOOKOUT BY THE PILOT OF THE HAWK BM-4, WHICH 
RESULTED IN HIS FAILURE TO SEE-AND-AVOID THE CESSNA 172. THE BM-4 PILOT'S 
NON-STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR ENTERING THE TRAFFIC PATTERN WAS A 
RELATED FACTOR.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT:
On January 2, 1994, at 1630 central standard time, a Palmer Hawk BM-4, N75DL, and a 
Cessna 172N, N739TL, were destroyed during a midair collision near Pearland, Texas.  Both 
airplanes were on final approach to runway 14R at Clover Field, which is an uncontrolled 
airport.  Two occupants of the BM-4 and three occupants of the Cessna received fatal injuries.  
Visual meteorological conditions with 15 miles visibility prevailed for the local flights.
Interviews with witnesses and associates revealed that the Cessna had departed Ellington 
Field, Houston, Texas, at 1558.  Its pilot-in-command was a flight instructor conducting a 
biennial flight review with the private pilot receiving dual instruction.  They performed several 
VFR patterns for touch and goes on runway 14R.  Pilots in the area recalled the Cessna pilot 
making the VFR uncontrolled field radio communications over the unicom frequency of 122.8.  
The BM-4 departed Clover Field at 1630 and flew westbound for a local personal flight.  Pilots 
in the area reported a radio transmission on 122.8 from the BM-4 pilot that he was 
approaching Clover Field from the west for a base entry. 
Witnesses observed the Cessna on short final for runway 14R.  Witness reports regarding its 
altitude varied from 200 feet to 500 feet above the ground.  Witnesses observed the BM-4 turn 
base to final behind the Cessna.  The BM-4 was initially observed higher above the ground and 
moving much faster than the Cessna.  Witnesses stated that it appeared the BM-4 was 
converging on the Cessna in distance and altitude.  The airplanes were described as impacting 
1000 feet before the approach end of runway 14R at an altitude of not more than 300 feet. 
Witnesses observed the airplanes remain together, rotate to the left and descend vertically to 
the ground.
DAMAGE TO AIRCRAFT:
The BM-4 was found resting on the left wing and cockpit area of the Cessna.  The BM-4 
sustained damage to the right wing and right main gear.  The Cessna color was white with 
brown trim and the BM-4 color was white with yellow trim.  Yellow paint transfers were 
observed on the upper left wing surface, the aft cabin support post and aft windshield of the 
Cessna.  Leading edge damage of the right wing of the BM-4 was approximately equal to the 
width of the aft windshield of the Cessna.  Flap actuator measurements indicated the flaps of 
the Cessna were extended 30 degrees.  An impact signature measurement at the outboard 
portion of the left flap of the Cessna was approximately equal to the BM-4 right landing gear 
strut width.  
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION:
The Office of the Medical Examiner of Harris County in Houston, Texas, performed the 
autopsies on all cockpit occupants.  
TEST AND RESEARCH:
Examination of the engines was conducted on January 25, 1994.  The engine examinations did 
not reveal any discrepancies.  Flight continuity was established.  The integrity of all fuel tanks 
was compromised.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
