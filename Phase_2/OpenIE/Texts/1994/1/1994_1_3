Factual Information
 On January 1, 1994, about 0659 eastern standard time, N648UA, a Boeing 767-322, operated 
by United Airlines Inc. as flight 984, scheduled, domestic, passenger service from Miami, 
Florida, to Chicago, Illinois, experienced a passenger initiated emergency evacuation on the 
ramp at the Miami International Airport.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the 
time and an IFR flight plan was filed. The airplane was not damaged and the airline transport-
rated captain and first officer, 5 flight attendants, and 162 passengers were not injured.  The 
flight was originating at the time of the incident.
     The airplane had been pushed away from the gate and the No/1 engine had been started.  
During the No/2 engine start, the fuel flow was reportedly high and a flame aft of the engine 
exhaust was observed by a passenger seated on the right side of the cabin.  The passenger then 
shouted "fire", opened the No/2L door and deployed the slide.  Passengers then began an 
uncommanded evacuation the airplane.  The No/1 flight attendant advised the captain that 
passengers were evacuating and the remainder of the passengers wanted to evacuate the 
airplane.  The captain directed that the No/1L and No/1R doors be opened and the emergency 
escape slides deployed for continued evacuation of the airplane.  The captain secured the 
engines then entered the cabin and stopped the emergency evacuation of the remaining 24

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
