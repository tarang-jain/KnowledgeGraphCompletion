Analysis 
THE PILOT ENTERED 9,380-FOOT LA VETA PASS AT 8,000 FEET MSL. HE SAID HE 
ENCOUNTERED TURBULENCE AND DOWNDRAFTS AS HE APPROACHED THE SUMMIT, 
AND THE AIRPLANE 'COULDN'T GENERATE ANY LIFT' AND STALLED. MOMENTS 
AFTER THE ACCIDENT, ANOTHER PILOT REPORTED OCCASIONAL MODERATE TO 
EXTREME TURBULENCE IN THE VICINITY. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S IMPROPER INFLIGHT DECISION TO ENTER A MOUNTAIN PASS AT AN 
INADEQUATE ALTITUDE, CAUSING THE AIRCRAFT'S CLIMB PERFORMANCE TO BE 
EXCEEDED. FACTORS WERE TURBULENCE AND DOWNDRAFTS.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On January 1, 1994, approximately 1224 mountain standard time, a Cessna 177RG, N53049, 
was destroyed when it struck trees near the top of 9,380-foot La Veta Pass, about 11 miles 
northwest of La Veta, Colorado.  The pilot and one passenger were seriously injured, two 
passengers received minor injuries, and another passenger was uninjured.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time, and no flight plan was filed for the personal 
flight.
The following is based on the Pilot/Operator report and a telephone interview with the pilot.  
According to the weather briefing he obtained prior to departure, only light to moderate 
turbulence around the Broomfield area was forecast.  As the airplane passed Pueblo, Colorado, 
the Denver Automated Flight Service Station advised the pilot of "light chop" in the area.  The 
flight was uneventful until they entered La Veta Pass at 8000 feet.  Approaching the summit, 
they encountered turbulence and downdrafts.  He said the airplane "couldn't generate any lift" 
and stalled.  The airplane struck aspen trees and travelled approximately 100 feet on a 
magnetic heading of 265 degrees before coming to rest in an inverted attitude.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
At 1220, a Beech 35 pilot, flying at 12,500 feet MSL, filed a pilot report (PIREP), in which he 
reported light turbulence and altocumulus standing lenticular clouds northwest of La Veta 
Pass. Ten minutes later, the pilot filed another PIREP, reporting occasional moderate 
turbulence and 1500 feet per minute up and downdrafts west of the pass.  At 1259, the pilot 
filed a third PIREP, reporting extreme turbulence, and noted he was "almost
turned upside down" southeast of La Veta Pass in the Sangre de Cristos mountain range.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The wreckage was released to the owner's representative on January 2, 1994.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
