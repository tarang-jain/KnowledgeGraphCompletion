Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
     On February 3, 1994, about 0546 central standard time, a Cessna T210M, N6572M, 
registered to D and D Manufacturing and Millwright Service, operating as a 14 CFR Part 91 
personal flight, crashed in the vicinity of Prentiss, Mississippi. The airplane experienced a total 
loss of engine power while in cruise flight, and a forced landing was initiated. The airplane 
collided with trees and was destroyed by a postcrash fire. The commercial pilot and one 
passenger were fatally injured. One passenger sustained serious injuries. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed and a VFR flight plan was filed. The flight originated from Macon, 
Georgia, about 2 hours 11 minutes before the crash.
     The survivor of the plane crash stated, he and the other passenger were sleeping when the 
pilot woke them up and informed them they were having engine problems. The engine was 
running rough and the engine oil temperature or cylinder head temperature was hot with the 
gauge indicating all the way to the right. The engine quit and the pilot tried to restart the 
engine several times without success. Just before the crash the pilot made a left turn, the 
airplane collided with trees and the ground and caught on fire. He exited the airplane through 
the windshield, and sustained serious thermal injuries. The pilot and other passenger did not 
get out of the airplane.
     Transcripts of recorded communication between Houston center and N6572M, revealed that 
N6572M was VFR at 6,500 feet. At 0539:41, N6572M informed Houston center that he was 
having a little engine problem, and stated that he had an airport straight ahead at about 11 
miles. Houston center informed the pilot the airport was on a 275 heading and 15 miles from 
his position. At 0541:10, N6572M reported my engine is out. The last recorded communication 
with N6572M was at 0545:00, and radar contact was lost at 0545:35, 5 miles east of the 
Prentiss Jefferson Davis Airport, Prentiss, Mississippi. Houston center requested the pilot of 
another airplane to attempt radio contact with N6572 which was uneventful. The pilot was 
requested to overfly the last known position of N6572 and see if he could locate the airplane. At 
0554:54, the pilot informed Houston center that he was circling a fire on the ground, and then 
relayed directions through Houston center to emergency vehicles proceeding to the crash site.
     A witness observed the airplane descending towards the west at about 0545, with the 
landing and navigation lights on. The witness did not hear any engine noise, and watched the 
airplane until it disappeared from view.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
     The pilot's logbook was consumed by postcrash fire. Additional information pertaining to 
the pilot-in-command, David K. Chapman, is contained in NTSB Form 6120.1/2 and NTSB 
Form 6120.4.

WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
     The wreckage of N6572M was located about 5 miles east of Prentiss, Mississippi, west of St. 
Stephens Road.
     Examination of the crash site revealed the left wing tip and left elevator collided with a tree 
while in a descending left turn about 80 feet above the base of the tree. The airplane continued 
forward about 236 feet. The left and right wing collided with trees about 30 feet above the base 
of the trees. The left and right fuel tanks were ruptured. The airplane collided with the terrain 
and came to rest on it's left side on a heading of 142 degrees magnetic about 286 feet from the 
initial point of impact. The airplane was consumed by postcrash fire.
     Examination of the propeller, airframe, and flight control system revealed no evidence to 
indicate any precrash mechanical failure or malfunction. Both header fuel tanks were 
consumed by postcrash fire. There was no evidence of torsional twisting or "s" bending on the 
propeller blades. Two propeller blades were bent aft and the remaining propeller blade was not 
damaged. All components necessary for flight were present at the crash site. Continuity of the 
flight control system was confirmed for pitch, roll, and yaw.
     Examination of the engine revealed the No. 5 piston was burned through on the top portion 
of the crown structure under the steel insert to the piston interior. The characteristics of the 
burned area were typical of detonation/preignition; the cause/sources of the apparent 
detonation/preignition could not be determined. Additionally, the No. 2 connecting rod was 
separated from the crankshaft; the connecting rod bolts fractures featured neck down and 
overheat characterics. All remaining connecting rods exhibited extreme temperatures as 
evidenced by the dryness and discoloration externally on the rod cap and beam. The 
connecting rod bearings were burned and the connecting rod bearing steel backing were 
extruded from the connecting rod caps. The engine oil was dark and a burned odor was 
present. There was no evidence of a precrash mechanical failure or malfunction of the engine 
accessories. See Teledyne Continental Motors Analytical Inspection Report.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
     Postmortem examination of the pilot, David K. Chapman, was conducted by Dr. Steven T. 
Hayne, Mississippi State Medical examiner's office, Jackson, Mississippi, on February 3, 1994. 
The cause of death was smoke inhalation. Postmortem toxicology studies of specimens from 
the pilot were performed by the Forensic Toxicology Research Section, Federal Aviation 
Administration, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. These studies were negative for neutral, and acidic 
drugs. Athenolol (0.148 ug/ml) was detected in the blood and urine. The source of the drug was 
not determined. Acetaminophen (5.500 ug/ml) was detected in the urine. Review of airman 
records on file with the Aeromedical Certification Division, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 
revealed the pilot had recorded on his application for a second class medical certificate dated 
January 29, 1993, that he did not currently use any medication. In addition he recorded that he 
did not have a history of high or low blood pressure.
TEST AND RESEARCH
     An oil sample was submitted to the Shell Development Company for analysis. The results 
indicated that the oil was relatively typical of a used AEROSHELL OIL W 100 oil with some 
oxidation and a very high level of metals and dirt contamination. The viscosity of the oil was 
Page 5 of 7MIA94FA064
20.6 at 100 degrees centigrade. The normal target viscosity is 19.5 to 20. The metal analysis 
revealed the sample contained 80 ppm silicon, 500+ ppm iron, 180+ ppm chrome, 150+ ppm 
nickel, and 980+ ppm aluminum, which indicates a total engine failure. The Teledyne 
Continental Motors Analytical Inspection Report states in part, "This aluminum would be 
material from the number 5 piston, indicating the piston burn through event was initiated 
prior to the oil distress event experienced by this powerplant." See Teledyne Continental 
Motors Analytical Inspection Report.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
     The wreckage was released to Jimmie M. Rickerson, Aeronautical Investigations, Inc., 
Lawrenceville, Georgia, on February 4, 1994. The engine was released to Fred H. Fine, Product 
Analysis, Teledyne Continental Motors, Mobile, Alabama, on March 24, 1994.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
