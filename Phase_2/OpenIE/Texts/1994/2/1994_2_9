Factual Information
 On February 3, 1994, about 1220 eastern standard time, a Cessna U-206, N72074, and a 
homebuilt OConnel Z-200, N199J, were involved in an on-ground collision while taxiing at 
Albert Whitted Airport, St. Petersburg, Florida. N72074 was operating as a 14 CFR Part 135, 
domestic, cargo flight as Red Barron No. 7. N199J was operating as a 14 CFR Part 91 personal 
flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and N72074 was on an IFR flight 
plan and N199J was not on a flight plan. Both aircraft were substantially damaged and both 
pilots reported no injuries. N72074 was initiating his flight at the time of the accident, and 
N199J was terminating his local flight that had started about 1100 the same day.
     The pilot of N72074 stated he saw the other aircraft at the last minute and was unable to 
take any evasive maneuver. The pilot of N199J stated that he was not "S-turning" his 
conventional gear airplane and did not see the other aircraft before impact.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
