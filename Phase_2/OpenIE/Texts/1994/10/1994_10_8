Analysis 
THE COMMERCIAL PILOT REPORTED TO ATC THAT HIS ENGINE WAS LOSING OIL 
PRESSURE WHILE IN CRUISE FLIGHT AT FL190. THE PILOT REQUESTED TO DEVIATE 
TO A NEARBY AIRPORT AND ATC CLEARED HIM TO DESCEND TO 12,000 FEET. THE 
PILOT ENTERED INSTRUMENT CONDITIONS AS HE PROCEEDED TO THE AIRPORT. 
DURING HIS EMERGENCY DESCENT, THE PILOT COMMUNICATED HIS INTENTIONS 
TO THE UNICOM OPERATOR AT THE AIRPORT OF INTENDED LANDING. WHEN ASKED 
ABOUT HIS LOCATION, THE PILOT STATED THAT HE WAS 8 MILES EAST, HAD LOST 
HIS OIL PRESSURE, AND HOPED HE DIDN'T HIT ANY OF THE MOUNTAINS. SEARCH 
AND RESCUE AIRCRAFT RESPONDING TO THE ELT SIGNAL REPORTED THAT THE 
MOUNTAINS WERE OBSCURED AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. THE AIRPLANE WAS 
LOCATED 400 FEET BELOW THE CREST OF A 9,765 FOOT MOUNTAIN.  THE BELLY AND 
UNDERSIDE OF THE FUSELAGE WAS COVERED WITH FRESH OIL. EXAMINATION OF 
THE ENGINE REVEALED THAT A 'B' NUT ON A BRAIDED OIL LINE CONNECTING THE 
OIL PUMP TO THE TURBOCHARGER WAS LOOSE. THE ENGINE TEARDOWN FOUND NO 
INTERNAL EVIDENCE OF LUBRICATION OR THERMAL DISTRESS WITHIN THE 
ENGINE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE LOSS OF ENGINE OIL PRESSURE DUE TO AN OIL LEAK FROM A LOOSE OIL LINE 
FITTING. FACTORS WERE THE OBSCURATION, AND THE UNSUITABLE TERRAIN AT 
THE PILOT'S DISPOSAL.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On October 1, 1994, at 1645 mountain daylight time, a Cessna T210M, N732VK, was destroyed 
during a forced landing near Richmond, Utah.  The instrument rated commercial pilot and his 
passenger were fatally injured.  An instrument flight plan was filed and a weather briefing 
received.  Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight.    
According to Air Traffic Control (ATC), the airplane was in cruise flight at FL190 on an IFR 
clearance from Woodland, California, to Lander, Wyoming.  The pilot reported losing engine 
oil pressure and requested to land at the Logan-Cache Municipal Airport (LGU), near Logan, 
Utah.  ATC cleared the flight direct to LGU and cleared the pilot to descend to 12,000 feet.  
Radio and radar contact were lost 10 miles northeast of Logan, while the aircraft was 
descending through 12,000 feet.
An employee of the Logan Airport monitored a transmission received on Unicom by the pilot of 
N732VK.  On the pilot's initial call, he stated that "he was experiencing oil pressure problems 
and was attempting a dead stick landing at Logan."  Another airplane in the pattern called the 
pilot in distress to find out his location from the airport.  The pilot responded that "he was 8 
miles east, had lost his oil pressure, was IMC, and he hoped he didn't hit any of the 
mountains."  The mountains east of Logan were obscured by clouds at the time of the accident.  
There were no reported eyewitnesses to this accident. 
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
The airplane was topped off with 68 gallons of 100LL aviation gasoline at the Woodlands-
Watts Airport, the evening before the accident.  The airplane was also serviced with 2 quarts of 
15W50 Aeroshell oil at that time.  The FBO manager reported in a telephone interview that 
prior to departing Lander, Wyoming, the pilot had asked him to service the airplane with one 
quart of oil, and to place 3 quarts of oil in the baggage compartment.  
The FBO manager also reported that the airplane had a substantial oil leak as evidenced by the 
heavily oil soaked belly, when the airplane was at his location last June, while on an overnight 
stay on a trip to Canada.
The airplane was home-based at Festus, Missouri.  The airplane and engine logbooks were not 
made available, and despite several attempts, they could not be recovered.
COMMUNICATIONS
A complete weather briefing was received and an IFR flight plan was filed with the Rancho 
Murieta Flight Service Station by the pilot prior to his departure from Woodland, California.  
The transcripts from all pertinent communications between the airplane and the ATC facilities 
are enclosed in this report. 
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The wreckage of the airplane was located on the east slope of Cherry Peak (elevation 9,765 
feet), approximately 400 feet below the crest of the mountain, on a heading of 020 degrees.  
The slope of the terrain was 50 to 60 degrees.  About 12 inches of snow fell after the accident.  
Damage to the leading edge of the right wing was more pronounced than that of the left wing.  
The airplane, configured with the gear and flaps in the retracted position, came to rest on a 
Page 4 of 6FTW95FA003
heading of 282 degrees.  Continuity was established to all flight controls.  The elevator trim tab 
was found with 1 3/4 inches of nose down tab.  The belly and underside of the airplane were 
found heavily soiled with fresh engine oil.  
The engine separated from the airframe, and came to rest in a drainage ditch approximately 
600 feet downslope of the main wreckage.  The exhaust system was not pliable at the time of 
impact and several cracks were observed within the exhaust stacks.  The propeller spinner was 
crushed, the hub was fractured and two of the three blades were separated from the hub.  The 
turbocharger assembly and one of the propeller blades were not recovered.
Both fuel cells were compromised by impact damage, and no fuel was found at the accident 
site.  Search and rescue personnel reported a strong smell of fuel when they first arrived at the 
accident site to recover the bodies.  
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
An autopsy and toxicological examination were requested and performed.  The autopsy was 
performed by Office of the Medical Examiner for the State of Utah, on October 10, 1994.  
Toxicological tests were negative.
TEST AND RESEARCH
The engine was recovered and transported to the engine manufacturer's facility where an 
examination and teardown of the engine was performed.  No internal defects or anomalies 
were found.  There were no internal signatures of lubrication or thermal distress within the 
engine.  The source of the oil leak was a braided oil line connecting the oil pump to the 
turbocharger waste gate actuator.  A "B" nut on 45 degree "L" fitting was found to be three and 
a half flats lose.  See enclosed report of the examination.
ADDITIONAL DATA
The wreckage was released to the owner's representative following the field portion of the 
investigation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
