Factual Information
 On October 1, 1994, at 1500 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Cessna 180 airplane, 
N2707X, registered to Greg Wiren of Chicken, Alaska, and operated by the pilot, ran off an 
airstrip near Taylor Mountain located near Aniak, Alaska.  The personal flight operating under 
14 CFR Part 91, was departing the airstrip and the destination was McGrath, Alaska.  No flight 
plan was filed and visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  The pilot and his passenger 
were not injured and the airplane was substantially damaged.
     According to the pilot, the airstrip was in poor condition with potholes and willows growing 
close to the edge.  During the takeoff roll, when he lifted the airplane's tail, the left main wheel 
"slipped" into a depression on the runway.  The left wheel continued to slip off the runway and 
into the willows on the runway's edge.  He stated it was too late to abort the takeoff and the 
airplane ran off the end of the runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
