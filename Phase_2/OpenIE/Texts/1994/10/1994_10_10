STRIKE THE PILOT PULLED OFF POWER AND THE AIRCRAFT COLLIDED WITH THE 
TERRAIN, COMING TO REST 30 YARDS FROM THE FENCE.

Factual Information
On October 1, 1994, at 2040 central daylight time, a Cessna 150L, N16191, was substantially 
damaged during landing near Booker, Texas.  The airplane, flown by a commercial pilot, was 
on a personal flight from Dodge City, Kansas.  No flight plan was filed and dark night visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed.  The pilot and one passenger were uninjured.
According to a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, the pilot made two previous 
attempts to land on the unlighted grass strip and executed two go-arounds.  He further 
reported that on the third attempt to land he allowed the aircraft to "settle lower and slower 
than planned."  The passenger stated "get it up" and the pilot applied "full power to climb."  
The pilot reported that immediately following the addition of power he "heard and felt a 
crunch."  The pilot reduced power following the crunching sound and the aircraft struck the 
ground.  After the pilot and his passenger exited the aircraft they discovered that the aircraft 
had struck a fence causing damage to the firewall and landing gear.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
