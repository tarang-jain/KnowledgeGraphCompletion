Analysis 
THE AIRPLANE WAS IN CRUISE FLIGHT WHEN THE ENGINE LOST POWER.  THE PILOT 
SWITCHED FUEL TANKS SEVERAL TIMES IN AN ATTEMPT TO REGAIN POWER.  HE 
WAS UNABLE TO SUSTAIN ENGINE POWER AND RESORTED TO A FORCED LANDING 
ON A ROAD, WHERE THE WING STRUCK A SIGN.  SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION 
REVEALED ONLY UNUSABLE FUEL REMAINING IN THE TANKS.  THE PILOT STATED 
THAT HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD FIVE HOURS OF FUEL ON BOARD THE AIRPLANE 
FOR THE INTENDED FLIGHT, BUT AFTER 4.4 HOURS ON THE HOBBS METER THE 
ENGINE BEGAN TO LOSE POWER FROM FUEL EXHAUSTION.

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
was the pilot-in-command's failure to refuel the airplane during the flight.  Factors were fuel 
exhaustion, the sign, and the pilot-in-command's lack of total experience in type of airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
