Factual Information
 On March 1, 1994, at 1720 mountain standard time (MST), a Cessna 172, N733WS, impacted a 
runway marker during an attempted landing  at Natrona County International Airport, Casper, 
Wyoming. The private pilot and his passenger were not injured, but the aircraft sustained 
substantial damage. The local personal pleasure flight, which departed the same location about 
20 minutes earlier, was in visual meteorological conditions at the time of the accident. No 
flight plan had been filed, and there was no report of an ELT activation.
According to the pilot, who was flying from the right seat, he was attempting to land in an eight 
knot 50 degree crosswind, when he experienced difficulty maintaining directional control 
during the landing flare.  During his attempted remedial action the aircraft drifted off the side 
of the runway and impacted a runway designation marker and a runway light.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
