Analysis 
THE PILOT CANCELED IFR & FLEW TO HIS PRIVATE STRIP, WHERE HE ENTERED A 
RIGHT TRAFFIC PATTERN FOR LANDING ON RUNWAY 36 IN DARK NIGHT 
CONDITIONS.  THE STRIP WAS LOCATED IN A RURAL AREA WITH FEW GROUND 
LIGHTS, EXCEPT FOR THE FIRST 1500 FEET OF THE STRIP, WHICH HAD MEDIUM 
INTENSITY RUNWAY LIGHTING (MIRL).  SOUTH OF THE STRIP WAS A LARGE 
MILITARY MANEUVERING AREA THAT HAD NO LIGHTING. AS THE PILOT WAS 
MANEUVERING TO LAND, WITNESSES OBSERVED THE AIRPLANE ENTER A STEEP 
DESCENT. SUBSEQUENTLY, IT CRASHED IN A STEEP NOSE DOWN, RIGHT WING LOW 
ATTITUDE. AN EXAM OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED EVIDENCE THAT THE SPOILERS 
WERE EXTENDED.  TOXICOLOGY TESTS OF THE PILOT'S LIVER & KIDNEY TISSUE 
SHOWED 0.74 UG/ML & 0.159 UG/ML, RESPECTIVELY, OF BROMPHENIRAMINE (AN 
ANTIHISTAMINE).  AN FAA TOXICOLOGIST STATED THESE WERE WITHIN A 
THERAPEUTIC RANGE. ACCORDING TO THE PILOT'S SON, HE TOOK DRIXORAL FOR 
SINUS PROBLEMS & A SLIGHT HEAD COLD; THE MEDICATION WAS NOT APPROVED 
FOR FLYING. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT, WHILE 
MANEUVERING TO LAND.  FACTORS RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: DARKNESS

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On March 1, 1994, at approximately 1850 central standard time, a Riley modified Cessna 
P337H, N2QY, was destroyed when it collided with the ground near North Little Rock, 
Arkansas.  The airplane, owned and flown by an instrument rated commercial pilot, was on a 
business cross country flight.  An instrument flight rules flight plan had been filed and 
cancelled and dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  The pilot, the sole 
occupant, received fatal injuries.
The pilot departed West Lafayette, Indiana, approximately 1620 central standard time on an 
IFR flight plan to Little Rock, Arkansas.  At 1834, Little Rock Approach Control cleared the 
flight for an ILS approach to runway 4L at the Little Rock Adams Field airport.  At 1838, the 
pilot advised the tower that he was VFR and stated he would like to cancel his flight plan and 
proceed VFR to his private strip, which was about 17 miles north of the airport.  The tower 
granted the request and gave an advisory that the restricted areas north of the airport were not 
active.  The tower then handed off the flight back to approach control.  At 1842, the pilot 
requested and received a frequency change so he could activate the lighting at his air strip.  At 
1846, the pilot returned to the approach control frequency and advised that he had the strip in 
sight.  Radar service was terminated at that time.
According to the pilot's son, who was waiting for him at the air strip, it was his father's habit to 
file IFR and then cancel and fly to the strip.  The son stated that the pilot had called him prior 
to his departure from West Lafayette, and advised of his estimated time of arrival.  As a result, 
the son was able to monitor the progress of the approach and the pilot's decision to cancel and 
proceed to the strip over a hand held radio.  The son stated that at that point, he drove to the 
south end of the strip to check for deer.  He then positioned his vehicle at mid-field where he 
waited for his father's arrival.
The son further stated that at approximately 1845, the runway lights were activated and he 
proceeded to the south end of the runway and positioned his vehicle so that the headlights 
shined on the threshold.  He then contacted the pilot over the hand held radio and advised him 
as to the status of the runway, which he said was "sloppy."  The son then saw the airplane 
approaching from the northwest, flying southeast, as was the pilot's normal approach path.  He 
observed both landing lights on.
The pilot then advised that he had lost his instrument lights and the son advised him to reset 
the circuit breaker and of its position.  The pilot advised he had regained the instrument lights 
and asked "how do I look."  The son advised that the airplane appeared to be "a little high."  
The son stated that at that point the airplane turned south, approximately paralleling the 
runway on the east side, on a right downwind.  The son said that the pilot then stated that he 
was going to start his base turn.  The son further revealed that at that point the airplane 
pitched nose down to what appeared to him to be a 45 degree nose down attitude.  He 
attempted to contact the pilot and said "What are you doing down there?  You're too low.  Pull 
up, pull up."  He related that the airplane appeared to begin a pull up as he lost sight of it 
behind a ridge which was located south of the runway. He subsequently saw a bright flash.
The son immediately called emergency services and the Little Rock tower and advised them of 
the accident.  The accident site was subsequently located on the Camp Robinson Military 
Page 4 of 8FTW94FA090
Reservation.  The accident site was two miles south of the threshold of the private strip on a 
heading of 195 degrees, west of the extended center line of the runway.
WITNESSES
In addition to the pilot's son, a second witness observed the accident from outside his truck 
which was parked about 1/4 mile from the accident site.  The witness stated that the airplane 
made a roll to the left and seemed to spiral straight down "with little to no time to recover."  He 
further stated that the airplane impacted nose first and exploded.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
The commercial pilot held multi-engine and instrument ratings.  He received a check out in the 
accident airplane and a biennial flight review on May 26, 1993.  After a review of the pilot's 
personal log, it was estimated he had accumulated a total of 472 hours of night time and 140 
hours in the accident airplane.  According to the pilot's son, his routine during the 72 hours 
prior to the accident was normal.  The pilot had departed for the business trip to Indiana on 
February 27, 1994, and had had normal business meetings and rest periods during the ensuing 
three days.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
The airplane was temporarily certificated in the Experimental (Market Survey) category at the 
time of the accident.  This was due to extensive modifications being performed by the Riley 
International Corporation.  The certificate was to have expired at midnight on the date of the 
accident; however, the FAA had agreed to issue another certificate.  The modifications 
included, but were not limited to the installation of two 310 horsepower Continental TSIO-
520-NB engines, with Hartzell three bladed propellers, re-instrumentation, new interior, and 
avionics.  The airplane was also equipped with a Horton STOL kit, which included spoilers and 
wing cuffs.  The spoilers allowed for increased rates of descent and control of descent rates.  
Discussions with FAA and Riley test pilots indicated that the stall characteristics of the airplane 
in steep turns with the spoilers deployed had not been explored, nor was it required.
Discussions with the pilot's son and the mechanic who conducted routine maintenance on the 
airplane revealed that they were aware of the instrument light circuit breaker having popped 
on at least two previous occasions.  Both were after the instrument panel had been rewired as 
part of the modification program.  After the first occurrence, the mechanic checked the 
instrument panel wiring, but did not find any short circuits or evidence of overheating.  When 
the breaker tripped the second time on February 2, 1994, the mechanic removed and replaced 
the 5 amp breaker with a like breaker.
It was estimated that the airplane was within the prescribed limits for weight and center of 
gravity, both at takeoff and at the time of the accident.  The airplane had been refueled with 
95.9 gallons of 100LL aviation gasoline prior to departure on the accident flight.
AERODROME INFORMATION
Runway 36, was equipped with 1,500 feet of medium intensity runway lights on the south end.  
The strip is located in a rural area with few ground lights other than the 1,500 feet of runway 
lighting.  Likewise, the area to the south of the strip, where the accident occurred, was a large 
military maneuver area with no ground lighting.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
Page 5 of 8FTW94FA090
The airplane impacted the ground about 1/4 mile west of the extended center line of runway 
36, for which the pilot was in a right traffic pattern.  Impact occurred in an open area 
surrounded by woods.  The main impact crater was measured to be 12 feet wide by 8 feet across 
and 5 to 6 feet deep in the center. In addition, an long thin imprint extended outward from the 
crater to the south.  Pieces of the right wing tip were found at the end of the imprint.  The wing 
imprint was about 6 inches deep along the span and was deeper at the tip end.  A diagonal 
imprint was found which ran between the wing imprint and the crater.  The diagonal imprint 
corresponded to the normal placement of the right wing strut.  Additionally, a round imprint 
was found immediately aft of the diagonal imprint and was found to correspond to the right 
main landing gear tire which was found to be covered in mud for 1/2 of the diameter.  The 
rightwing imprint was oriented on a measured heading of 015 degrees, which corresponded to 
an airplane heading at impact of 105 degrees.  All of the separated wreckage pieces and mud 
blown out of the crater were located to the north and west of the crater.  Pieces of airplane 
windshield and the left rudder balance weight were found just forward of the east side of the 
crater.
The forward engine separated from the mounts and was found in the main crater.  The aft 
engine was found attached to the aft fuselage section.  The right wing was found in several 
pieces, while the left wing was found intact, 129 feet north of the wreckage.  The left wing 
leading edge was compression damaged from root to tip.  Remnants of the main fuselage floor 
and instrument panel were found about 50 feet north northwest of the crater.  All of the flight 
controls were accounted for at the accident site.  Control continuity could not be established 
due to the disintegration of the structure; however, all of the cable fractures and separations 
appeared to be overstress.  Evidence, in the form of pulled panels and hinge impact marks, 
indicated that the spoilers were deployed at impact.  The "spoiler deployed" light panel was 
located.  The bulbs were LED type and therefore a filament analysis was not possible.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
An autopsy was performed by the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory Medical Examiner.  
Toxicology testing was performed by the FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute.  The findings were 
not considered significant.  The toxicology tests found 0.74 ug/ml of Brompheniramine 
(antihistamine) in the liver, 0.159 ug/ml in the kidney and an undetermined amount in the 
lung.  These levels were within the therapeutic range.  According to the son, the pilot took 
Drixoral for sinus problems and a slight "head cold."  
Antihistamines are contraindicated for flying and the Physician's Desk Reference contained 
warnings for the use of Drixoral which stated in part "May cause drowsiness" and "Use caution 
when driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery."  According to the CAMI flight surgeon, 
the use of antihistamines while flying can mask other symptoms which can induce vertigo.  
According to the director of the toxicology lab at CAMI, "the pilot should not have been taking 
Brompheniramine for two reasons: (1) Definitely for the medication, most antihistamines can 
cause drowsiness, (2) Possibly for the underlying condition that was being treated."
FIRE
According to the two witnesses, the airplane exploded on impact.  Evidence at the site 
supported their statements.  The left wing, cabin floor, and the rear section of the fuselage were 
involved in a post-crash fire and several small grass fires were ignited.
TEST AND RESEARCH
Page 6 of 8FTW94FA090
Engine Tear Down and Examination:  Following recovery of the wreckage, both engines were 
partially disassembled and examined.  No evidence of pre-impact failure or malfunction was 
found in either.  Both vacuum pumps were examined.  Both were intact as were their respective 
drives.  The rotors were shattered on both. Mud was found in the front vacuum pump.
Instrument Panel Light Examination:  The instrument panel light circuit breaker was located 
in the separated circuit breaker panel.  The breaker was not tripped or damaged as a result of 
impact and showed no evidence of distress.  Examination of several light bulbs recovered from 
the instrument panel revealed evidence of filament stretch.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
