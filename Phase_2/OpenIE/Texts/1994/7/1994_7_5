Factual Information
 On July 1, 1994, at 2240 central daylight time, a Cessna 182E, N901JM, registered to Larry G. 
Howes of Superior, Colorado, and piloted by a commercial pilot, impacted the terrain while  
attempting to land at Garden City Municipal Airport, Garden City, Kansas.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident and an instrument flight plan 
was filed.  The personal flight was operated under 14 CFR part 91.  The aircraft sustained 
substantial damage.  The pilot reported minor injuries.  The flight originated from Lawrence, 
Kansas, at approximately 1950, with the intended destination of Lamar, Colorado.
En route to Lamar County the pilot-in-command decided to stop at Garden City Municipal 
Airport to refuel.  According to the pilot's statement the engine quit at approximately 2235.  He 
stated that he attempted to restart the engine, but was unable to do so.  He decided to land in a 
furrowed wheat field approximately four miles northeast of Garden City Municipal Airport.  
During the landing the airplane impacted rough terrain.
A subsequent examination of the airplane revealed only unusable fuel remaining in the tank.  
There were no leaks in the fuel system observed at the scene of the accident.
The pilot supplied fuel receipts indicating fuel purchased en route.  He was unable to speculate 
as to why the airplane suffered fuel exhaustion.  He said that the loss of engine power came as a 
surprise to him.  He stated the stop for fuel was being made, not because he felt an immediate 
need for fuel, but that he would be unable to obtain fuel on arrival at his final destination due 
to the late hour.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
