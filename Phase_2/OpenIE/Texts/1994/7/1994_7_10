Factual Information
 On July 1, 1994, about 1800, Atlantic standard time, N4287L, a homebuilt, Quicksilver GT-
500, registered to the pilot Eduardo Castellanos, crashed in the water adjacent to Palmas Del 
Mar, Puerto Rico, while on a 14 CFR Part 91 flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed 
at the time and no flight plan was filed for the local flight. The recreational certificated pilot 
received fatal injuries, the passenger received minor injuries, and the airplane was destroyed. 
The flight had originated from a local airport about 15 minutes earlier.
     Witnesses and the passenger stated that the pilot was flying about 20 feet above the water 
along the beach and was attempting to point out an apartment to the passenger. The pilot 
stated he would slow the airplane down and he added flaps. The passenger observed the nose 
pitch down and the airplane collided with the water and sank. The passenger stated he released 
his shoulder harness and seatbelt and swam to the surface for air. He attempted to dive to 
release the pilot twice but could not do so. The passenger was then assisted to the shore by 
surfers in the area.
     Examination of the airplane, engine, and controls by the FAA inspector revealed no evidence 
of preimpact failures.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
