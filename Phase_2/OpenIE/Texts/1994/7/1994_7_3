Factual Information
 On July 1, 1994, at 1119 central daylight time, a Cessna 172, N7472X, registered to Dale L. 
Storm of Black Creek, Wisconsin, collided with trees and the terrain during initial takeoff climb 
from runway 27 (1,350' x 90', grass) at the Shiocton Airstrip, Shiocton, Wisconsin.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed and a VFR flight plan was filed.  The private pilot and two 
passengers were seriously injured.  A third passenger received minor injuries.  The airplane 
was destroyed by impact and post crash fire.  The flight was departing for La Crosse, 
Wisconsin, when the accident occurred.
The pilot stated, the winds were westerly at approximately 23 knots and the takeoff was 
normal.  He reported that as he neared the wooded area west of the airport "...it seemed as if 
the wind stopped.  I had no lift, airspeed started to drop."  He stated he lowered the nose to 
increase airspeed but that the "winds were pushing down on plane."  The airplane crashed in 
the wooded area and was destroyed by fire.  The pilot stated he made the takeoff using 10 
degrees of flaps and that the stall warning horn sounded prior to impacting the trees.
Two witnesses reported seeing the airplane take off "slowly" and it was "slow getting up in the 
air."  One of the passengers stated the pilot initially attempted to take off on runway 36 (2,240' 
x 100') but was unable to get airborne.  The pilot then elected to take off on runway 27.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
