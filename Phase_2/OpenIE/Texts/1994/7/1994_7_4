Factual Information
 On July 1, 1994, about 1600 central daylight time, a Callair A9B airplane, N2851F, operated by 
Pietsch Spraying Inc. of Minot, North Dakota, sustained substantial damage when it collided 
with terrain 12 miles southwest of Minot.  The commercial pilot sustained no injuries.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed for the aerial application flight conducted under CFR 14 
Part 137.  The local flight originated at Minot International Airport about 1530.  No flight plan 
was filed.
The pilot reported the airplane was equipped with "super booms" which trail beneath the 
airplane.  He said he was flying low to optimize spraying along the side of a hill.  On the fourth 
pass he "went through a whirlwind and stuck the boom in the wheat."  He said the airplane 
swung around, impacted the terrain, and stopped in approximately 300 feet.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
