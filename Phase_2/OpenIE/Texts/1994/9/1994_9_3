Substantial

2 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
According to the pilot, as he approached his destination airport in his hot air balloon, the 
balloon encountered a downdraft from a dissipating thunderstorm.  He intended to bring the 
hot air balloon down to the ground quickly to avoid the wind from blowing the balloon across 
the ground. Although he continued burning all the way to the ground, the pilot was unable to 
stop the balloon's high rate of descent.  The gondola impacted the ground hard, rebounded into 
the air to approximately 100 feet above the ground, and then impacted the ground again.  The 
balloon continued along the ground until it struck power lines where it came to rest. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's excessive rate of descent to landing.  Factors in the accident were the gusts and 
downdraft.

Factual Information
 On September 1, 1994, at 1915 central daylight time, a Firefly 7- 15 balloon, N2597S, was 
substantially damaged when it landed hard at Storm Lake Municipal Airport, Storm Lake, 
Iowa.  Both the commercial pilot and passenger received serious injuries.  The 14 CFR Part 91 
flight originated from a field located eight miles northeast of Storm Lake, Iowa.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the flight.
According to the pilot, he inflated the hot air balloon and ascended with one passenger aboard 
en route to Storm Lake Municipal Airport.  He states as the balloon approached the airport, the 
balloon encountered a downdraft from a dissipating thunderstorm which was several miles 
away.  The pilot believed that he would have to bring the balloon down to the ground quickly to 
avoid the wind from blowing it across the ground.  Although he continued burning all the way 
to the ground, he was unable not stop the balloon's high rate of decent.  The gondola impacted 
the ground hard and the pilot was thrown from the basket.  A fire started near the burner 
assembly as the balloon rebounded into the air.  The passenger was still aboard.  The pilot 
states the balloon climbed to approximately 100 feet above the ground and then started to 
descend.  The balloon impacted the ground for a second time.  At this point the passenger was 
able to crawl out on the gondola.  The balloon continued along the ground until it struck power 
lines where it came to rest.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
