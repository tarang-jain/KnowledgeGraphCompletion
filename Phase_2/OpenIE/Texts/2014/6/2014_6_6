Analysis   
According to the pilot, she flew the glider into the landing pattern and checked the airbrakes. 
She lined the glider up to land on the grass runway, but landed close to its right side where 
other aircraft were parked. Upon touchdown, the glider bounced. The pilot added left stick and 
rudder, but the glider veered to the right and hit an airplane parked off side of the runway, 
resulting in substantial damage to the glider's right wing. The pilot did not report any 
preexisting mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
