Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Business
Analysis   
According to the pilot, she was flying an instrument landing system approach when she noted 
that the glide slope was out of service. She transitioned to a localizer-only approach and 
continued. Night, instrument meteorological conditions prevailed with a 400-foot ceiling. She 
noticed that the airplane was "high and fast" on final approach, so she used speed brakes and 
flaps to slow the airplane and descend to the minimum descent altitude. As the airplane 
descended below the ceiling, she observed runway lights and attempted to land on the runway. 
The airplane landed long, departed the runway at the departure end, and struck an 
embankment before coming to rest. An inspector from the Federal Aviation Administration 
examined the airplane and confirmed substantial damage to the fuselage, wings, and 
empennage. The pilot reported no pre-impact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain a proper glide path and airspeed on final approach, which 
resulted in a long landing and runway excursion.
Findings

Airspeed - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Low ceiling - Contributed to outcome
Debris/dirt/foreign object - Contributed to outcome

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
