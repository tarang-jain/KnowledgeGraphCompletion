Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
According to the student pilot, he was performing a full stop landing from the left seat with his 
instructor in the right seat. During the flare, a sudden gust of wind "pushed the airplane to the 
left" and the instructor took the controls. The instructor pilot also reported that a sudden, 
heavy gust of wind was encountered, and the airplane "started ballooning up" and turned 
"drastically" to the left. The instructor attempted a go-around; however, the airplane was 
already at low altitude and it collided with the ground. The airplane impacted hard on the 
grassy area adjacent to the runway, breaking off the nose gear. Federal Aviation Administration 
inspectors reported that substantial damage resulted to the airframe's left and right wings. The 
instructor pilot reported that there were no mechanical problems with the airplane at the time 
of the accident. Although there was no weather reporting capability at the landing airport, 
gusting wind conditions were reported about 18 miles to the northwest.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to compensate for gusting wind conditions during the flare, and the 
flight instructor's failure to intervene in a timely manner, resulting in a loss of airplane control 
and hard landing off of the runway.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=90352
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
