Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Darby, MT
Accident Number:
WPR15LA036
Date & Time:
11/07/2014, 0900 MST 
Registration:
N84462
Aircraft:
CHAMPION 7AC
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
2 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The commercial pilot reported that he was attempting to land the light sport airplane on a 
private grass airstrip surrounded by mountainous terrain. While maneuvering for landing, the 
airplane suddenly entered into a steep, right-wing-low bank. The wings then leveled 
momentarily before the airplane impacted the ground. The passenger in the rear seat of the 
airplane stated that he felt a downdraft or windshear just prior to impact. A post-accident 
examination of the airplane found no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. 
The pilot reported the wind as light and variable with 5-10 knot gusts; however, he stated that 
during previous flights in the area, he experienced unexpected severe gusts and terrain-
induced turbulence, followed by complete calm. 
The airplane was not equipped with a stall warning system or flaps. Since the airplane was 
maneuvering for landing approach at low airspeed, a sudden gust of wind or shift in wind 
speed or direction could have resulted in a rapid loss of airspeed, followed by an aerodynamic 
stall as the airplane reached its critical angle-of-attack. Due to the airplane's low altitude, the 
pilot likely did not have sufficient time to recover from the stalled condition prior to impacting 
terrain. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain airspeed while maneuvering in gusting wind conditions, which 
resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle of attack and experiencing an aerodynamic 
stall.

Factual Information
On November 7, 2014, at 0900 mountain standard time, a Champion 7AC, N84462, impacted 
a farm field and wheeled sprinkler system, 10 miles south of Darby, Montana. The commercial 
pilot and single passenger were seriously injured, and the airplane was substantially damaged. 
The airplane was registered to the pilot and operated under the provisions of 14 Code of 
Federal Regulations, Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight, 
and no flight plan had been filed.
According to the pilot he was attempting to land on a private grass airstrip in a farm field 
surrounded by mountainous terrain when the accident occurred. Witnesses observed the 
airplane descending at an estimated 90 degree right-wing-low bank angle; the wings then 
leveled before impacting the ground. 
The pilot stated that due to injuries he could not recall all the events leading up to the accident; 
however he recalled observing a TV interview of a witness after the accident, in which the 
witness stated that it was windy at the time of the accident. The nearest weather reporting 
station was 40 nautical miles north of the accident site and reported wind from 230 degrees at 
4 knots. The pilot reported light and variable winds with 5-10 knot gusts at the time of the 
accident; however he stated that he has experienced unexpected severe gusts and terrain 
induced turbulence pass through the area momentarily followed by complete calm. 
The pilot rated passenger in the rear seat recalled that he felt what he believed to be wind shear 
or a down draft before impact.
Post-accident examination of the airplane did not reveal any failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation. Further examination revealed that an 
undetermined amount of aviation fuel was recovered from the fuel system. It was also noted 
that the airplane was not equipped with flaps or a stall warning system.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
