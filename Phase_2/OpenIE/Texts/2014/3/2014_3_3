Analysis   
According to a written statement provided by the pilot to a Federal Aviation Administration 
inspector, he performed a three-point landing in the tailwheel equipped airplane. The airplane 
"bounced two times," and then it veered to the right. According to a written statement from the 
passenger, the "approach was normal, [but the] problems started after touchdown." The 
airplane turned to the right, the pilot initiated a go around; however, the left wing rose up, and 
the airplane "lost control" to the right. The airplane came to rest in the grass on the right side 
of the runway, and incurred substantial damage to the firewall and fuselage. A postaccident 
examination of the airplane revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with 
the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of directional control of the airplane during landing, which resulted in a runway 
excursion.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
