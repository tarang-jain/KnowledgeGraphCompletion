Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The high-wing, tailwheel-equipped airplane had just been signed off on its most recent annual 
inspection, and the pilot/owner had also topped off the fuel tanks before he flew it about 10 
miles to a friend's private grass/dirt airstrip. The pilot described it as a "one way" strip, 
explaining that the landing direction was "uphill" and the takeoff direction was "downhill." The 
pilot had operated into and out of the airstrip about 20 times previously. All those flights, as 
well as that day's inbound flight and landing, were uneventful. After boarding and start up, the 
pilot back-taxied to the top of the rise that constituted the beginning of the runway. That 
section of the runway was more steeply sloped (downhill) than the rest of the runway. As the 
pilot reached the beginning of the runway, he made a 180-degree left turn, and began the 
takeoff roll; he did not straighten the tailwheel prior to application of takeoff power. As soon as 
the pilot added takeoff power, the nose "went about 15 degrees left." The pilot continued the 
takeoff attempt, and tried to recover the desired ground track by application of full right 
rudder. The pilot saw that the airplane was headed for a golf cart, with a person seated in it, 
that was situated about 80 feet off the left side of the runway. The pilot opted to turn more 
sharply left in order to avoid the cart and person, and this action took the airplane on a track 
that was more divergent from the runway axis. The left main landing gear struck a hummock 
and fracture-separated from the airplane, which resulted in lower fuselage and left wing 
ground contact. The airplane slid to a stop, with substantial damage to the fuselage and left 
wing. The pilot stated that the wind was "way under" 10 mph, coming onto the right side of the 
airplane during the takeoff attempt. He reported that he did not abandon the takeoff attempt at 
the initial veer off, because he was concerned about the airplane nosing over onto its back 
during an attempt to stop. One passenger reported that the initial directional excursion was 
"almost immediately" about 45 degrees off the runway axis. Post-accident examination of the 
airplane did not reveal any pre-impact conditions which would have precluded normal 
operation. Review of weight and balance information indicated that the center of gravity was 
very slightly forward of the forward limit, and the airplane might have been very slightly above 
its maximum certificated takeoff weight. Neither condition would have contributed to the loss 
of directional control. 
Probable Cause and Findings
Page 2 of 5WPR14CA184
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of directional control during takeoff. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's 
failure to abort the takeoff at the initial veer off.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Landing gear steering system - Incorrect use/operation
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Decision making/judgment - Pilot (Factor)
Environmental issues
Sloped/uneven terrain - Contributed to outcome

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
