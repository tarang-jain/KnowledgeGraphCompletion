Location:
Frederick, MD
Accident Number:
ERA14CA217
Date & Time:
05/01/2014, 1910 EDT 
Registration:
N802CP
Aircraft:
ROBINSON HELICOPTER R22 BETA
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Dynamic rollover
Injuries:
2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
According to the flight instructor, his student was practicing hover operations over a grassy 
area of the airport. This was the first flight in a helicopter for the student pilot. The helicopter 
drifted to the right while descending. The right skid contacted the grass and the helicopter 
rolled to the right and the main rotor blades contacted the ground. The helicopter continued to 
roll over and came to rest on its right side. An inspector from the Federal Aviation 
Administration examined the helicopter and confirmed substantial damage to the fuselage, tail 
boom, and main rotor blades. The pilots reported no pre-impact mechanical malfunctions or 
failures with the helicopter that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the hover, and the flight 
instructors lack of remedial action, resulting in a dynamic rollover and structural damage to 
the helicopter.
Findings

Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=89154
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
