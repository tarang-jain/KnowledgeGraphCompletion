Accident Number:
CEN14CA227
Date & Time:
05/02/2014, 1700 CDT 
Registration:
N7308P
Aircraft:
PIPER PA 24-250
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion
Injuries:
4 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot with three passengers planned to depart and return on a cross-country flight. The 
pilot stated that the airplane's left fuel tank was filled to an inch below the collar, and the right 
fuel tank was filled to two inches below the collar. He estimated that the airplane had 40-45 
gallons of fuel on board, with a planned en route time of 57 minutes, and about a 10 knot 
tailwind. Once at a cruise altitude of 7,500 feet, he set the manifold pressure at 21 inches and 
engine rpm at 2,300 for a fuel burn of 12.3 gallons/hr per the pilot operating handbook. The 
pilot reported for the return leg he again visually checked the fuel level in each tank. He 
estimated 12-15 gallons in the left tank and 10 in the right, for a total of 22-25 gallons. The pilot 
added that fuel burn seemed normal and he decided not to add fuel, he also stated that 
estimations are not an accurate science and that a fuel stick was not provided to confirm the 
fuel level. After departing for the return flight, he switched fuel tanks from the left side to the 
right side. About 15 minutes later, the pilot noticed a reduction in power and switched back to 
the left side fuel tank. Engine power was restored, and the pilot stated that he did not feel that 
the fuel had been exhausted from the right side based on his calculations. A few minutes later, 
the engine lost power and the pilot preformed a forced landing to a construction site. A post-
crash examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the airplane's fuselage and 
left wing during the forced landing. Additionally, the fuel tanks were empty and were not 
breached in the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion, which resulted from the pilot's inadequate 
preflight planning and inflight decision making.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=89160
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
