Aircraft:
CESSNA 170B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The student pilot was practicing solo takeoff and landings in a tailwheel-equipped airplane on a 
dry, hard surfaced runway. At the beginning of the flight, the winds were light and variable, but 
during the last landing, the wind had shifted to a slight tailwind. During the landing, the pilot 
lost control of the airplane, and ground looped, sustaining substantial damage to the right 
wing. The pilot reported no preaccident mechanical anomalies with the airplane that would 
have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to recognize a wind shift, resulting in a tailwind landing, loss of control, and 
ground loop.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
