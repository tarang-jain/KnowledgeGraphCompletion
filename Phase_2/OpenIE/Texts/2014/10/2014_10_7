Location:
Atlanta, AR
Accident Number:
CEN15CA007
Date & Time:
10/03/2014, 1330 CDT 
Registration:
N4426M
Aircraft:
BELL 206B
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Dynamic rollover
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Positioning
Analysis   
The helicopter had been transported to a remote area with the skid landing gear secured to the 
helicopter transport trailer with four heavy duty ratchet type tie-downs. After arrival at the 
work location the pilot and several ground crewmembers prepared the helicopter for an 
agricultural application flight. The pilot reported that during his walk-around inspection prior 
to the flight he had overlooked the right rear tie-down, and he attempted to takeoff with the tie-
down still attached to the helicopter. As power was applied the helicopter immediately rolled to 
the right and impacted terrain. Both main rotor blades were impact separated mid-span and 
the transmission and skid landing gear were partially separated. The helicopter sustained 
substantial damage to the main rotor system, transmission, tail rotor, tail boom and fuselage. A 
postaccident examination found no preimpact mechanical anomalies with the helicopter. The 
characteristics displayed by the helicopter were indicative of it encountering a dynamic 
rollover.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate preflight inspection when he did not remove a tie-down strap prior to 
takeoff, which resulted in a dynamic rollover.
Findings
Aircraft
Tie-down/mooring - Inadequate inspection (Cause)
Personnel issues
Lack of action - Pilot (Cause)

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=90229
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
