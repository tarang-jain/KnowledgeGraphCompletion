Aviation Incident Final Report
Location:
Atlanta, GA
Incident Number:
ERA15IA009
Date & Time:
10/01/2014, 2105 EDT 
Registration:
N301EF
Aircraft:
FUNK RALPH Velocity XLRG
Aircraft Damage:
Minor
Defining Event:
Hard landing
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The purpose of the flight was to perform three takeoffs and landings at night. The pilot stated 
that the first takeoff and landing was uneventful and that, at touchdown, he used aerodynamic 
braking to slow the airplane by keeping its nose off the runway as long as possible. He added 
that the second landing was faster, that more runway was used, and that the nose landing gear 
(NLG) touched down ﬁharderﬂ than during the first landing. After the NLG touched down, the 
airplane pulled right and developed a shimmy. The pilot subsequently lost directional control 
of the airplane, and the NLG collapsed. Examination of the fracture surfaces on the NLG 
revealed features consistent with ductile overstress fracture. The overall fracture pattern was 
consistent with fracture under a lateral bending load.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
The pilot™s failure to maintain directional control during a hard landing, which resulted in the 
fracture of the nose landing gear.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)

Factual Information
On October 1, 2014, about 2105 eastern daylight time, a Funk Velocity XLRG experimental 
amateur-built airplane, N301EF, sustained minor damage during a hard landing to Cobb 
County Œ McCollum Field (RYY), Atlanta, Georgia. The private pilot was not injured. Night 
visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the local flight which 
departed RYY about 2105. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 
Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.
In a written statement, the pilot stated that he intended to perform 3 takeoffs and landings for 
the purpose of maintaining night currency. He said the first takeoff and landing were 
uneventful, and that at touchdown he used "aerodynamic braking to slow down by keeping the 
nose off the runway as long as possible." The pilot explained that the second landing was the 
same as the first, only the approach was faster and more runway was used. He said, "I started 
braking as I dropped the nose and it came down harder than the first landing."
The pilot stated that after the nose gear touched down, the airplane was "pulling" to the right, 
and developed a shimmy. He said he attempted to maintain directional control with braking as 
the shimmy in the front end intensified, and then the nose gear subsequently collapsed, which 
resulted in minor damage to the nose landing gear doors and the nose enclosure. The pilot 
added that he has had the nose "drop harder onto the runway in the past with no ill 
consequences."
The pilot held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land and 
instrument airplane. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued 
December 12, 2012. He reported 926 total hours of flight experience, of which 774 hours were 
in the incident airplane make and model.
According to FAA records, the airplane was manufactured in 2002. Its most recent conditional 
inspection was completed June 26, 2014 at 321 total aircraft hours.
According to maintenance records, a refurbished nose landing gear was installed September 
26, 2014.
At 2120, the weather observation at RYY included clear skies and calm winds.
Examination of the airplane by an FAA aviation safety inspector revealed minor damage to the 
nose landing gear doors and the nose enclosure.
On October 27, 2014, the fractured segments of the nose landing gear leg were examined in the 
NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, DC. Examination of the fracture surfaces revealed 
features consistent with ductile overstress fracture. The overall fracture pattern was consistent 
with fracture under a lateral bending load.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
