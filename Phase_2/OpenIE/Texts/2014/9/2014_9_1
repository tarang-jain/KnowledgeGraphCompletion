Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot was landing a tailwheel-equipped airplane, at an off-airport site, which required a 
correction for an 8 knot, left quartering crosswind. During touchdown, the airplane bounced, 
and he attempted to recover, but the airplane drifted to the left. The pilot reported that he 
applied full engine power to abort the landing, but the airplane subsequently collided with a 
stand of alder trees at the end of the site, and nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial 
damage to the fuselage and left wing. The pilot reported there were no preaccident mechanical 
malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate recovery from a bounced landing, resulting in a runway excursion and 
collision with trees.
Findings

Note:

to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=90004
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
