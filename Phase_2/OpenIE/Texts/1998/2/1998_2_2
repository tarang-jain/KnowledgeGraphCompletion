Factual Information
 On February 1, 1998, at 1215 eastern standard time (est), a Cessna 150M, N6327K, operated by 
a solo student pilot, sustained substantial damage when landing on runway 27 at Oakland-Troy 
Airport, Troy Michigan, the airplane departed the runway and subsequently nosed over.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The solo instructional flight 
was being conducted under 14 CFR Part 91.  There was no flight plan on file.  The student pilot 
reported no injuries.  The local cross country flight originated at Romeo, Michigan, at 1200 est.
In his written statement, the student pilot said that on landing, he experienced "turbulence and 
crosswind."  On touchdown, the airplane drifted to the left.  The nose wheel got stuck in the 
mud, and the airplane flipped 180 degrees.
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector examined the airplane at the accident site.  
The airplane had departed the runway's left edge approximately halfway down from the 
approach end, and nosed over.  The airplane's right wing was broken at the second rib inboard 
from the wing tip.  The upper and lower skin of the right wing showed heavy wrinkling, 
especially in the area between the flap hinges.  Several wing skin rivets in the area of the right 
wing fuel tank had popped causing part of the wing skin to come off.  The nose gear was bent to 
the left and aft.  The vertical stabilizer and rudder were bent to the right and crushed 
downward.  The airplane's engine was bent downward at the mounts.
The upper engine cowling was bent downward and aft.  The spinner was crushed inward.  One 
propeller blade was bent aft approximately 30 degrees.  Flight control continuity was 
confirmed.  Examination of the engine, engine controls, brakes and other airplane systems 
revealed no anomalies.
The aviation routine weather reporting (METAR) station at Oakland-Pontiac Municipal Airport 
[13 miles northwest of Oakland- Troy Airport] at 1145 est, reported winds 200 magnetic 
heading at 12 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
