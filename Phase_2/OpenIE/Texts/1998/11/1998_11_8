Location:
WILLOW, AK
Accident Number:
ANC99LA011
Date & Time:
11/03/1998, 1450 AST 
Registration:
N5129Y
Aircraft:
Piper PA-12
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The certificated private pilot reported that while in cruise flight at 1,000 feet msl, all engine 
power was lost.  He stated that all attempts to restore engine power failed, forcing him to select 
an open swampy meadow as an emergency landing area.  During the ensuing landing roll, the 
airplane's main landing gear contacted soft tundra, and the airplane nosed over.  The airplane 
sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage and tail.  The NTSB investigator-in-charge 
did not have access to the airplane or engine after recovery, and was unable to perform a 
postaccident inspection. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power due to an undetermined reason.  A factor associated with the accident 
was unsuitable terrain for a forced landing.

Factual Information
 On November 3, 1998, about 1450 Alaska standard time, a wheel equipped Piper PA-12 
airplane, N5129Y, sustained substantial damage following a loss of engine power and 
subsequent off airport forced landing about 15 miles northeast of Willow, Alaska.  The airplane 
was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) local area personal flight under Title 14, CFR 
Part 91, when the accident occurred.  The certificated private pilot, and the one passenger 
aboard were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was 
filed.  
During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-
in-charge on November 4, 1998, the pilot reported that while in cruise flight at 1,000 feet msl, 
all engine power was lost.  He stated that all attempts to restore engine power failed, forcing 
him to select an open swampy meadow as an emergency landing area.  During the ensuing 
landing roll, the airplane's main landing gear contacted soft tundra, and the airplane nosed 
over. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage and tail.
The NTSB investigator-in-charge did not have access to the airplane or engine after recovery, 
and was unable to perform a postaccident inspection.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
