Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
During takeoff, at about 400 feet, the canopy separated from the airplane.  The pilot turned the 
airplane back towards the airport and landed without further incident.  The pilot reported that 
he did not explain to the passenger that the right side of the canopy needed to be latched before 
takeoff.  The pilot also reported that he did not observe the canopy warning light during taxi to 
the runway, nor did he complete the 'Canopy-Secure' portion of the pre-takeoff checklist. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to follow the checklist and secure the canopy, which resulted in the canopy 
separating from the airplane during takeoff initial climb.  A factor was the pilot's failure to 
detect the canopy warning light prior to takeoff.

Factual Information
 On October 1, 1998, at 1230 central daylight time, a Diamond Aircraft Industries DA 20-A1 
single-engine airplane, N527SS, was substantially damaged when the canopy separated during 
takeoff from David Wayne Hooks Memorial Airport near Tomball, Texas.  The private pilot and 
his passenger were not injured.  The airplane was registered to MDFC Equipment Leasing 
Corporation of Long Beach, California, and operated by Flight Academy International of 
Spring, Texas.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a flight plan was not filed for 
the 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 personal flight, which was originating at the 
time of the accident.
According to the Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report, NTSB Form 6120.1/2, the pilot did 
not explain to the passenger that the right side of the canopy needed to be latched before 
takeoff.  The pilot stated that he did not observe the canopy warning light during taxi to the 
runway, nor did he complete the "Canopy-Secure" portion of the pre-takeoff checklist.  The 
pilot also stated that after takeoff from runway 17L, at about 400 feet, he heard a "rapid-
sounding noise for several repetitions, followed by the canopy disengaging itself from the 
fuselage."  
Following the separation of the canopy, the pilot's headset was lost from the "burst of wind."  
As a result, tower communication was not possible.  The pilot turned the aircraft back towards 
the airport and landed on runway 35L "without further damage to [the] aircraft."
The canopy was recovered approximately 1/4 mile south of the localizer antennas for runway 
17R.  
According to the FAA inspector, the main structural spar behind the cockpit, to which the 
canopy was attached, sustained damage.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
