None
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 121: Air Carrier - Scheduled
Analysis 
The flight was at 4,000 feet when Air Traffic Control gave the crew a traffic report.  The crew 
could not locate the traffic, because at the time they were flying in instrument meteorological 
conditions.  About 3 minutes later the crew received a TCAS (traffic collision avoidance system) 
alert to climb.  The flight climbed from 4,000 feet and leveled off at 5,300 feet.  During the 
climb both flight attendants fell.  One flight attendant broke her leg, the other was not injured.  
The flight attendants were standing completing their pre-landing duties when the event 
occurred.  The pilot radioed ATC that he needed to have an ambulance meet the flight when it 
landed.  The flight landed without further incident, and the flight attendant was taken to a local 
hospital. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
an abrupt maneuver in response to a traffic avoidance system alert, resulting in a flight 
attendant falling and breaking a leg.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
