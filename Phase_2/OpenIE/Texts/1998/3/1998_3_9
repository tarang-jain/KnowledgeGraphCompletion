Factual Information
 On March 3, 1998, at 1700 Alaska standard time, a ski equipped Cessna 180H airplane, 
N4751U, sustained substantial damage when its left wing impacted trees during landing roll at 
the Tatitna landing strip, Tatitna, Alaska.  The commercial certificated pilot and the one 
passenger aboard were not injured.  The flight was conducted under 14 CFR Part 91 as a 
personal flight from Rainbow Lake in Big Lake, Alaska, to Tatitna.  Visual meteorological

The pilot stated to the NTSB investigator that during his landing roll, the airplane's skis 
encountered a snow machine rut, and began to track to the left.  The pilot said he applied 
power and full right rudder, but the left wing contacted willow trees on the side of the 1,200 
feet long by 12 feet wide, snow covered landing strip.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
