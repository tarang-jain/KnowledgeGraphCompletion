to the pilot, '...Full power was brought up and the brakes were released.  The aircraft veered 
immediately to the left and not having airspeed to correct, I could not bring it to centerline.  
The [airplane] accelerated but continued to the left...' The pilot then aborted the takeoff, 
however, the airplane continued to left, impacted a tree, and flipped over.  Examination of the 
wreckage did not reveal any pre-impact abnormalities of the airframe or engine.  The pilot

Factual Information
 On September 1, 1998, about 1800 eastern daylight time, a Maule MX-7-160, N6287P, 
was substantially damaged during takeoff from a private unlisted grass airstrip in Skaneateles, 
New York.  The certificated private pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and no flight plan had been filed for the personal flight conducted under 14 CFR Part 
91.
In a written statement, the pilot said he taxied the tail-wheel airplane to runway 28, a 
1,900 foot long, 70 foot wide, grass runway.  He further stated:
"...Full power was brought up and the brakes were released.  The aircraft veered immediately to 
the left and not having airspeed to correct, I could not bring it to centerline.  The [airplane] 
accelerated but continued to the left so I aborted the takeoff, chopped the power, and applied 
brakes.  As the [airplane] skidded almost to a stop, the left wing clipped a small pine tree. 
The airplane flipped over and skid to a stop. 
Examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration Inspector did not 
reveal any pre-impact abnormalities of the airframe or engine.
During an interview with an FAA Inspector, the pilot stated he did not remember if the 
airplane's tail wheel was straight when he commenced the takeoff roll.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
