Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On December 3, 2017, about 1910 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-31-310, N722CF, was 
damaged during a wheels-up landing on runway 18 at the Clark Regional Airport (JVY), 
Jeffersonville, Indiana. The pilot and two passengers were not injured. The airplane received 
substantial damage to fuselage longerons and the aft flange of the main wing spar carry 
through. The aircraft was registered to Luftladder Inc. and operated by the pilot under the 
provisions of Title 14 
Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual 
meteorological conditions existed at the time of the accident. A visual flight rules flight plan 
had been filed. The flight originated from the Wellsville Municipal Airport (ELZ), near 
Wellsville, New York, about 1630, with JVY as the intended destination.
The pilot reported that when the airplane was about 5 miles from JVY, he lowered the landing 
gear and the right main landing gear was slow to extend, but within a few seconds all three gear 
down indicator lights illuminated. A normal descent was made and when the airplane was over 
the runway about to flare, the right main landing gear light went out. The pilot initiated a go-
around, increasing engine power, pitching for climb, and retracting the landing gear and flaps. 
He stated that the airplane may have settled after the flaps were retracted and he heard a noise 
as if a propeller blade had contacted something. He decided to discontinue the go-around and 
landed the airplane straight ahead, coming to a stop on the runway with the landing gear 
retracted.
After the accident the airplane landing gear was tested under the supervision of Federal 
Aviation Administration inspectors. Before the test, an o-ring was replaced on the hydraulic 
reservoir, but this would not have prevented the right main landing gear from extending. The 
gear retraction tests were performed satisfactorily, with no defects in the landing gear 
operation noted.
