Location:
Mount Airy, NC
Accident Number:
GAA18CA067
Date & Time:
12/01/2017, 1600 EST 
Registration:
N701TF
Aircraft:
TODD FOLEY ZENITH 701
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot of the experimental, amateur-built airplane reported that, during takeoff, he raised 
the nose after reaching about 20 mph, and about 40 mph, the airplane lifted off the runway. He 
"held the stick back just a little [too] long and it started to tip stall to the left and [he] pushed 
the stick forward." He added that he applied right aileron and rudder because the airplane was 
drifting to the left side of the runway. Subsequently, the airplane aerodynamically stalled and 
bounced on the runway, and the right wheel separated from the airplane. He then, with full 
power, continued to fly and make right aileron and rudder inputs to get back over the runway. 
The airplane impacted the ground and came to rest inverted.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, and wings.
The automated weather observation system at the accident airport reported that, about the 
time of the accident, the wind was from 090° at 4 knots. The pilot was departing from runway 
18.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during takeoff, which resulted in 
an aerodynamic stall.

Preventing Similar Accidents
Prevent Aerodynamic Stalls at Low Altitude
While maneuvering an airplane at low altitude in visual meteorological conditions, many pilots 
fail to avoid conditions that lead to an aerodynamic stall, recognize the warning signs of a stall 
onset, and apply appropriate recovery techniques. Many stall accidents result when a pilot is 
momentarily distracted from the primary task of flying, such as while maneuvering in the 
airport traffic pattern, during an emergency, or when fixating on ground objects.
An aerodynamic stall can happen at any airspeed, at any altitude, and with any engine power 
setting. Pilots need to be honest with themselves about their knowledge of stalls and 
preparedness to recognize and handle a stall situation. Training can help pilots fully 
Page 5 of 5GAA18CA067
understand the stall phenomenon, including angle-of-attack (AOA) concepts and how weight, 
center of gravity, turbulence, maneuvering loads, and other factors can affect an airplane's stall 
characteristics. The stall characteristics may be different in each type of airplane, so learn them 
before you fly.
The stall airspeeds marked on the airspeed indicator (for example, the bottom of the green arc 
and the bottom of the white arc) typically represent steady flight speeds at 1G at the airplane's 
maximum gross weight in the specified configuration. Maneuvering loads and other factors can 
increase the airspeed at which the airplane will stall. For example, increasing bank angle can 
increase stall speed exponentially.
Reducing AOA by lowering the airplane's nose at the first indication of a stall is the most 
important immediate response for stall avoidance and stall recovery. This may seem 
counterintuitive at low altitudes, but is a necessary first step.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=96414
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
