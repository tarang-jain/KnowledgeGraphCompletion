CEN17FA067
Date & Time:
01/04/2017, 1208 CST 
Registration:
N311SD
Aircraft:
Demmer BD-4
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
1 Fatal, 1 Serious, 1 
None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On January 4, 2017, about 1208 central standard time, an experimental, amateur-built BD-4 
airplane, N311SD, sustained substantial damage during a runway excursion and subsequent 
impact with a parked vehicle while attempting to take off from Capitol Airport (02C), 
Brookfield, Wisconsin. The private pilot was fatally injured. One passenger received serious 
injuries; an additional passenger was not injured. The pilot owned and was operating the 
airplane under the provisions of Title 14 
Code of Federal Regulations
 Part 91. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and an instrument flight rules 
flight plan was filed but not opened for the personal flight, which was destined for New River 
Valley Airport (PSK), Dublin, Virginia. 
The pilot's wife reported that she and her 6-month-old son waited inside airport office while 
the pilot loaded the bags onto the airplane and conducted a preflight inspection. She then 
helped the pilot push the airplane out of the hangar. The infant was buckled into a car seat that 
was secured in the left rear seat, and she sat in the right rear seat with her seat belt on. After 
the pilot completed his inspection, he boarded the airplane and buckled his seat belt. After 
engine start, he taxied the airplane to the runway 21 and performed a run-up, checking the 
flight controls and engine power; there were no anomalies. The wife reported that he properly 
deflected the ailerons for the wind conditions and applied full engine power while holding the 
brakes. He then released the brakes and the airplane began its takeoff roll. She could not see 
over the nose of the tailwheel-equipped airplane, but she felt it depart the ground then quickly 
settle back onto the runway; she assumed that the pilot was aborting the takeoff. She stated 
that the airplane became airborne again as the pilot applied more right rudder to maintain the 
runway centerline. She stated, "I felt us unnaturally veer left and thought 'more right rudder.'" 
The airplane turned farther left and veered off the runway. She reported that the pilot was 
"vigorously pumping the rudders back and forth (left and right). It was at this time everything 
went black." The airplane subsequently impacted a parked sport utility vehicle (SUV), which 
rolled over onto its side upon impact.
A witness reported that the pilot was in and out of the airport office while preparing for the 
flight. He stated that the wind condition was "pretty obvious with the wind sock being straight 
Page 2 of 6CEN17FA067
out," but that the pilot did not specifically mention the wind. Although the witness could not 
see the airplane when it started its takeoff roll, when it came into view, it appeared that the 
airplane was "having difficulty." The nose was slightly up, the right wing was down, and the tail 
was "oscillating." He stated that the airplane never got more than 10 ft in the air after it drifted 
off the runway surface. He watched the airplane for 3 to 5 seconds before it went out of sight; 
the impact occurred about 2 seconds later.

The pilot, age 41, held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land and 
instrument airplane. His most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) third-class 
airman medical certificate was issued on February 26, 2013, with no restrictions. Review of the 
pilot's logbook indicated that he had about 1,241 total hours of flight experience, with 50 hours 
in the accident airplane. The pilot's most recent flight review was conducted on December 12, 
2015. 
The pilot and the airplane's co-owner had purchased the airplane in 2015 and started flying it 
in 2016. The pilot's logbook indicated that he flew 32 flights between April 24, 2016, and 
November 14, 2016. In the "Remarks, Procedures, Maneuvers" column in the logbook, the pilot 
mentioned crosswind conditions in 5 of the 32 flights. On May 7, he wrote that he practiced 
crosswind landings with an instructor pilot. On May 13, he wrote, "MC 1
st
 flight. Takeoff X-W 
(illegible mark) drift. More cruise test w/pants +10?" On May 20, he wrote, "X-W solo practice 
(80° off @ 8 kts). On June 22, he mentioned, "Heavy gusting landing Œ PLOP!" On October 23, 
he added a remark, "Gusty!"
The pilot made numerous entries in the Remarks section concerning airplane performance, 
such as cruise airspeed tests, stall speeds with and without flaps, Vx (best angle of climb 
airspeed), Vy (best rate of climb), maximum rate of climb, and a maximum gross weight test

The airplane, serial number 11361, was manufactured in 2002. It was a tailwheel-equipped, 
high-wing cantilever monoplane with a 200-horsepower Lycoming IO-360-A1A reciprocating 
engine, serial number L-11173-51A. The airplane's last annual condition inspection was 
completed on September 1, 2016, at a tachometer time of 586.44 hours. The tachometer read 
610.99 hours at the accident site. 
The airplane was equipped with four seats and had a maximum gross weight (MGW) of 2,400 
lbs. The empty weight was 1,494 lbs with a useful load of 906 lbs. The combined weight of the 
pilot and passengers was estimated at 361 lbs. Numerous bags were found in the wreckage and 
their total weight was 187 lbs; the location of the bags in the airplane during the accident flight 
could not be determined. The airplane held a total of 80 gallons of fuel. A fuel receipt showed 
that the pilot purchased 25 gallons of fuel at 02C. It was not determined how much fuel was on 
the airplane during the accident flight; however, in order to remain within the 2,400-lb MGW 
limitation, the fuel load could not have exceeded 60 gallons. The distance between 02C and 
PSK was about 500 nautical miles, which would have required about 30 gallons of fuel. 
The pilot made the following aircraft logbook entry on April 23, 2016: 
Completed Phase-1 test flight hours IAW operating limitations dated 11/24/2015. I certify 
that the prescribed flight test hours have been completed and the aircraft is controllable 
throughout its normal range of speeds and throughout all maneuvers to be executed, has no 
hazardous characteristics or design features, and is safe for operation. The following aircraft

operating data has been demonstrated during the flight testing: Vso (65mph), Vx (90 mph), 
and Vy (110 mph), at the weight (2300#), and CG location (89.1")
The BD-4 kit builder's website provided aircraft performance information for a BD-4C 
airplane, which is a newer kit version than the accident airplane. The performance 
specifications listed on the website indicated that the landing roll distance was 600 ft.

The pilot received a preflight weather briefing at 0915 provided by Lockheed Martin Flight 
Service (LMFS). During the weather briefing, the pilot and the weather briefer discussed the 
AIRMET Tango valid at 0915, including all the AIRMETs along the intended route of flight, 
and that current surface observations near the departure airport were VFR. The weather 
briefer asked if the pilot would like any Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF), and the accident 
pilot replied that he had the TAFs. The accident pilot did not request any additional weather 
information and only requested an abbreviated briefing.

On the day of the accident, FAA inspectors examined the skid marks on the runway, the wheel 
tracks in the grass between the runway and the taxiway, and the wheel tracks in the grass 
leading to the aircraft parking ramp where the collision with the vehicle occurred. The total 
distance from where the skid marks began on the runway to the parked SUV, a Chevrolet 
Tahoe, was 953 ft. The skid marks were not continuous. About 63 ft of tire skid marks that 
were veering to the left were found at the intersection of runways 21 and 27. The airplane 
departed the edge of the runway with no tracks through the snow or grass for about 298 ft on a 
southerly heading. This was followed by 110 ft of ground movement indicated by tire skid 
marks on the paved taxiway and tire tracks through the grass. Then there were no tire tracks 
for 220 ft, and then the tire tracks reappeared and traveled through the grass for 262 ft, to 
where the airplane impacted the SUV. The impact with the SUV caused it to be displaced about 
8 ft and tipped over onto its left side. The airplane's engine, fuselage, and empennage were 
found on the left side of the SUV. The entire wing separated from the fuselage during impact 
and came to rest about 91 ft beyond the main wreckage. The SUV was parked in an aircraft tie-
down area about 250 ft from the runway 21 centerline.
Examination of the wreckage after it was recovered to a hangar revealed rudder control cable 
continuity from the rudder pedals to the control surface. The elevator control tube was 
connected to the elevator bellcrank, but the control tube was fractured and was not connected 
Page 6 of 6CEN17FA067
to the control stick. The fractures were consistent with overload. The aileron control system did 
not exhibit continuity, but the fractures were consistent with overload failure.
The propeller spinner did not exhibit aft crushing or torque signatures. One of the propeller 
blades had a leading-edge gouge, span-wise scraping of the cambered surface, and aft bending. 
The other blade exhibited aft bending but no significant leading-edge nicks or gouges and no 
chordwise scratching.
Medical And Pathological Information
The Waukesha County Medical Examiner's Office, Waukesha, Wisconsin, conducted an 
autopsy of the pilot. The cause of death was multiple injuries. 
The FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 
performed toxicological testing on the pilot. No carbon monoxide was detected in the blood. 
The test for cyanide was not performed. No ethanol was detected in the vitreous. Testing 
detected 1.808 (µg/ml, µg/g) Ketamine in liver and 0.767 (µg/ml, µg/g) in blood (cardiac); 
Midazolam in blood (cavity) and in the liver; Morphine in the blood (cavity); 0.492 (µg/mL, 
µg/g) Norketamine in liver and 0.058 (µg/mL, µg/g) in blood (cavity).
Ketamine is an anesthetic, midazolam is a sedating benzodiazepine, and morphine is an opioid 
pain medication. Review of postaccident treatment records for the pilot revealed that ketamine 
was administered as part of his initial postaccident medical care. Given that midazolam and 
morphine are commonly used to sedate patients during medical procedures such as surgery, it 
is most likely that all of the identified medications were administered during postaccident care.
