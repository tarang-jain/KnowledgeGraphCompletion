Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Atlanta, GA
Accident Number:
ERA17LA078
Date & Time:
01/05/2017, 1700 EST 
Registration:
N683AM
Aircraft:
AIRCRAFT MFG & DEVELOPMENT CO 
CH 2000
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private pilot attempted a short-field takeoff procedure, and air traffic control tower 
personnel observed the airplane about 200 ft above ground level about 900 ft from the 
beginning of the runway. The airplane then drifted left, descended, and impacted trees. 
Although the pilot subsequently reported a loss of engine power and climb performance, a test 
run of the engine following the accident revealed no anomalies. The pilot had an approximate 
5-year gap in flying experience and had not completed a flight review, although he reported 
about 21 hours of flight experience in the 90 days preceding the accident. He reported a total 
flight experience of 143.3 hours, of which 59 hours were in the accident airplane make and 
model. It is likely that the pilot exceeded the airplane's critical angle of attack while attempting 
a short-field takeoff, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at an altitude too low to recover.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack while attempting a short-field 
takeoff, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
Findings
Aircraft
Angle of attack - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)

Factual Information
On January 5, 2017, about 1700 eastern standard time, an Aircraft MFG & Development Co, 
CH 2000, N683AM, was substantially damaged when it collided with trees, during the initial 
climb after takeoff from Cobb County International Airport (RYY), Atlanta, Georgia. The 
private pilot was seriously injured. The airplane was operated by the private pilot as a personal 
flight conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the planned local flight.
The pilot reported that he had planned to perform some touch-and-go landings at RYY. During 
initial takeoff on runway 27, he applied full power and initiated a climb at the appropriate 
airspeed. Shortly thereafter, the airplane experienced a loss of engine power and climb 
performance. The left wing and nose dropped, but no stall warning horn sounded. The pilot 
leveled the wings and configured the airplane quickly for landing, before colliding with trees.
The pilot further reported that he had acquired his private pilot license in 2009, but had not 
flown between 2010 and 2015. He also had not completed a current flight review. The pilot 
reported a total flight experience of 143.3 hours; of which, 59 hours were in the same make and 
model as the accident airplane. He had flown 21.3 hours during the 90-day period preceding 
the accident.
According to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, air traffic control personnel 
observed the airplane about 200 feet above ground level as it was approximately 900 feet from 
the beginning of runway 27. The airplane then drifted left, descended, and impacted trees.
The inspector further stated that the airplane came to rest in a wooded area south of runway 
27, about 1,400 feet from the beginning of the runway. The inspector examined the wreckage at 
the accident site and noted that during the impact, the airplane suffered damage to both wings 
and the fuselage. The inspector observed the flaps in the full-extended position. He also found 
an airplane operating handbook in the cockpit and observed that it was open to a page 
describing short field takeoffs and landings. He added that due to impact damage, some fuel 
had leaked from the airplane.
After the wreckage was recovered to a salvage facility, a test-run of the engine on the airframe 
was conducted under the supervision of an FAA inspector. The engine started without 
hesitation and ran for several minutes at different power settings, including full power.
The recorded wind at RYY, at 1647, was from 300 degrees at 3 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
