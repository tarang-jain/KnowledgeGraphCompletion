Aviation Accident Preliminary Report
Location:
Paradise, MT
Accident Number:
WPR17LA046
Date & Time:
01/03/2017, 0915 MST 
Registration:
N710XP
Aircraft:
SOFTEX INVEST LLC V-24L

2 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On January 3, 2017, about 0915 mountain standard time, an experimental amateur-built 
Softex Investment LLC V-24L, N710XP, made an off airport landing near Paradise, Montana. 
The owner was operating the airplane under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The airline transport pilot and one passenger sustained serious 
injuries. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The cross-country personal flight 
departed Missoula, Montana, about 0830 with a planned destination of Seattle, Washington. 
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.
The pilot stated that the purpose of the flight was to return the airplane to its home base in 
Seattle. Damage to a left propeller blade had been discovered on a previous flight in July while 
the airplane was in transit from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to Seattle. After those repairs, an attempt 
to make the return flight under visual flight rules (VFR) was unsuccessful, and the airplane 
returned to Missoula where damage was again discovered on the left propeller. The propeller 
was removed, sent to a repair station for disassembly and repair, and installed back onto the 
airplane. The accident flight was another attempt to return to Seattle under VFR conditions.
The pilot stated that the airplane was about 2,000 feet above ground level when a severe 
vibration developed. He applied maximum power to both engines, but could not get the 
airplane to maintain altitude; it began to descend rapidly. He landed in an open area of a 
railroad yard.
