Analysis   
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, during the landing roll in crosswind 
conditions, the airplane began an uncommanded slow right turn. He added that he applied left 
brake and left rudder, but the airplane continued to turn right. Subsequently, the airplane 
ground looped to the right, the left main landing gear collapsed, and the left wing impacted the 
ground. 
The left wing sustained substantial damage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation system on the airport reported that, about 10 minutes 
after the accident, the wind was from 90° at 9 knots. The pilot landed on runway 36.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
