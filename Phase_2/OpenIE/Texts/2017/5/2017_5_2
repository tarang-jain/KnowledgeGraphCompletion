Registration:
N68VY
Aircraft:
CIRRUS SR20
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Hard landing

2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The student pilot reported that, during crosswind landing conditions, the airplane landed hard 
and subsequently bounced. He added that he initiated a go-around, and then the flight 
instructor took the flight controls. 
The flight instructor reported that, after the bounce, the airplane "began to roll to the left in a 
manner similar to that of an uncoordinated stall." He added that he attempted to regain 
control of the airplane but was unsuccessful. The airplane rolled right, and the right wing 
impacted the ground. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings. 
The flight instructor reported that there were no preimpact mechanical failures or 
malfunctions with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation station located about 7 miles north of the airport reported 
that, about 1 minute before the accident, the wind was from 150° at 11 knots. The airplane 
landed on runway 24.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to adequately compensate for crosswind conditions during a go-
around and the flight instructor's delayed remedial action.

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=95088
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
