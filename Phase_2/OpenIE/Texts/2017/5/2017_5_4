Analysis   
On May 2, 2017 at 7:30pm eastern daylight time, JetBlue flight 1317, an Airbus A320, N595JB, 
encountered turbulence resulting in a serious injury to a flight attendant. The flight was a 
regularly scheduled flight from Boston Logan Airport (BOS), Boston, Massachusetts, to the 
John F Kennedy International Airport (JFK), New York, New York. There were no other 
injuries, and no damage to the airplane. 
According to the flight attendant statements, the #3 flight attendant (FA) stated that because 
the ride was "slightly bumpy," she remained seated for an additional 5 to 10 minutes after the 
cabin received the double chime indicating that the flight had passed 10,000 feet. Once it 
seemed to have smoothed out, she stood up and began to prepare for cabin service. Shortly 
after standing up, the airplane shook violently and she was tossed off her feet and into the air 
and landed on her right ankle, ending up on the galley floor. 
According to the flight crew statements, they had just completed a flight into BOS on a 
different airplane with nothing more than light turbulence on descent. Prior to the accident 
flight, the captain briefed the #1 FA that they had just flown in and didn't expect anything 
worse than light turbulence during climb out. During climb out, the flight crew indicted they 
were in and out of the clouds and only experience light chop. The weather radar was on but 
"was not painting anything." Just prior to leveling off at 14,000 feet they encountered a strong 
jolt of turbulence and then received a call from the cabin about the #3 flight attendant injury. 
At the time of the turbulence, the fasten seatbelt sign was illuminated.
The injured FA was assisted into a rear customer seat for the remainder of the flight with her 
foot elevated and ice applied. Because the injured FA was incapacitated, the #2 FA crewed the 
#3 FA position and a nonrevenue FA crewed the #2 FA position. The flight was met by 
emergency medical personnel and the FA was transported to a local hospital where she was 
diagnosed with a broken right ankle.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=95132
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
