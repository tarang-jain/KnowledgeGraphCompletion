Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Blue Earth, MN
Accident Number:
GAA17CA215
Date & Time:
04/02/2017, 2200 CDT 
Registration:
N8889X
Aircraft:
CESSNA 182
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Controlled flight into terr/obj 
(CFIT)
Injuries:
2 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that, while approaching the destination airport in night, marginal visual 
meteorological conditions, he turned on the pilot-controlled runway lights. He added that he 
began a descent to the runway without observing the runway lights or airport and encountered 
"ground fog" about 200 to 300 ft above ground level (agl). He further added that he continued 
the descent to the runway while referencing the navigational moving map and GPS altitude on 
his electronic flight bag (EFB) application ForeFlight. Subsequently, while in a left turn, the 
airplane impacted terrain about 1 nautical mile south of the runway. 
The left wing, firewall, and fuselage sustained substantial damage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation. He added that, while en route, he reset 
his airplane-installed barometric pressure altimeter to the GPS altitude indicated on his EFB, 
which resulted in a "300 ft. error." 
An automated weather observing station, about 14 nautical miles west of the accident airport, 
recorded visibility at 2 1/2 statute miles, light rain, mist, and an overcast cloud ceiling at 300 ft 
agl.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Page 2 of 6GAA17CA215
The pilot's decision to continue the night, visual flight into instrument meteorological 
conditions, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain while on final approach. 
Contributing to the accident was the pilot's improper use of an electronic flight bag.

Preventing Similar Accidents
Reduced Visual References Require Vigilance
About two-thirds of general aviation accidents that occur in reduced visibility weather 
conditions are fatal. The accidents can involve pilot spatial disorientation or controlled flight 
into terrain.
Preflight weather briefings are critical to safe flight. In-flight weather information can also help 
pilots make decisions, as can in-cockpit weather equipment that supplements official 
information. In-cockpit equipment requires an understanding of the features and limitations.
We often see pilots who decide to turn back after they have already encountered weather, at 
which point, it is too late. Pilots shouldn't allow a situation to become dangerous before 
deciding to act. Additionally, air traffic controllers are there to help; be honest with them about 
your situation and ask for help.
Even when flying at night, visual weather conditions can also be challenging. Remote areas 
with limited ground lighting provide limited visual reference cues for pilots, which can be 
disorienting or render rising terrain visually imperceptible. Topographic references can help 
pilots become more familiar with the terrain. The use of instruments, if pilots are proficient, 
can also help pilots navigate these challenging areas.

The NTSB presents this information to prevent recurrence of similar accidents. Note that this should 
not be considered guidance from the regulator, nor does this supersede existing FAA Regulations 
(FARs).

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=94958
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
