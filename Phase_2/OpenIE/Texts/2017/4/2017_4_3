Analysis   
The pilot of the amphibious airplane reported that, during a no-flap water landing, he noticed a 
higher descent rate than expected. He added that he applied full power to initiate a go-around 
but that the airplane landed hard on the water. The pilot and passenger egressed the airplane 
and were rescued without further incident.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot reported that he believed the airplane encountered "a windshift/shear to a tailwind as 
[he] transitioned high to low for landing approach toward the [south-southwest]." A review of 
recorded data from the automated weather observation station located about 6 miles west of 
the accident site reported that, about 17 minutes before the accident, the wind was from 090° 
at 9 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain a proper descent rate during the approach, which resulted in a 
hard landing.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=94954
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
