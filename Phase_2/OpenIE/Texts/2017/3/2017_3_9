Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot of the tailwheel-equipped airplane reported that, while landing on a road in gusting 
crosswind conditions, the right wing lifted to about a 60° angle. He immediately initiated a go-
around and added full power and right aileron and lowered the nose. The airplane had drifted 
off the center of the road to the left heading toward power lines, and the pilot chose to go under 
them. After the airplane cleared the power lines, the left wing tip struck the ground, and the 
airplane cart-wheeled. The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings, the fuselage, 
and the empennage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during a go-around.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=94814
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
