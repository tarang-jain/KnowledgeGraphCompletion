Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The student pilot reported that, during a solo flight, he was performing takeoffs and full-stop 
landings in the traffic pattern. During the landing roll, he configured the flaps to 0 and applied 
full power. The airplane pulled to the left, and he overcompensated the right rudder pedal 
application. "In an immediate reaction to reverse this I applied left rudder to quickly and went 
immediately to far left causing a fishtailing effect." The airplane exited the runway to the left 
and struck runway signage and a fence. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left 
wing, the landing gear attachment points, the horizontal stabilizer, and the elevator.
The student pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures 
with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's overcompensation of right rudder pedal application during the landing roll, 
which resulted in a loss of directional control and impact with runway signage and a fence.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
