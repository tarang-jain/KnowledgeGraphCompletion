On October 2, 2017, about 1048 Atlantic standard time, a Cessna 182D, N9021X, collided with 
terrain during landing at Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport (SIG), San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
The airplane was substantially damaged. The private pilot was fatally injured, and a pilot-rated 
passenger was seriously injured. The airplane was registered to and operated by a private 
individual under the provisions of 14 
Code of Federal Regulations 
part 91. Day, visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight. The 
flight originated at Cyril E. King Airport, Charlotte Amalie, United States Virgin Islands, about 
1015.
According to air traffic control, the pilot was cleared to land on runway 9 behind a flight of two 
Blackhawk helicopters. While on short final for landing, the pilot was given clearance to land 
after the helicopters had cleared the runway at Bravo 4 intersection. The controller reported 
that the airplane touched down about 500 feet prior to Bravo 5 intersection, bounced, and 
came to rest in a grass infield, inverted. First responders were called, and the occupants were 
taken to a local hospital.
The owner of the airplane reported that the pilot flew the airplane from STT to SIG without his 
knowledge or permission. The pilot had previously flown the airplane to STT to keep it out of 
the path of Hurricane Irma.
According to photographs provided by the airport manager, the airplane came to rest inverted 
in a grass area adjacent to the runway. Structural damage was observed on the fuselage, 
empennage, and both wings. There was no fire. The wreckage was retained for further 
examination.
