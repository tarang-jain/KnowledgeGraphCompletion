2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that, during landing, the airplane touched down about "150 ft. beyond [the 
runway] numbers" and he immediately "removed flaps and applied brakes." He added that he 
was "unable to stop the forward momentum of the plane," and he believed he was going to 
overrun the runway, so he applied full power to go-around. Subsequently, the airplane overran 
the runway before a climb rate could be established, and during the runway excursion, the 
airplane struck a chain link fence. During the impact, the right wing separated from the 
fuselage, and the airplane rolled inverted down a ravine before coming to a stop on the main 
landing gear. The pilot further reported that, after the accident, he believed he came in "too 
fast" for landing. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, and both wings. 
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's use of an incorrect airspeed during landing, which resulted in a runway overrun.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
