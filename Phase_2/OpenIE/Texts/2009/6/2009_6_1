Analysis   
The student pilot stated that he returned from a solo cross-country flight and entered the 
traffic pattern for landing. During touchdown, the airplane's nose pitched up and the pilot 
subsequently pulled back on the flight controls. The airplane became airborne, then settled and 
bounced a second time on the runway. After a third and more pronounced bounce, the nose 
gear collapsed and the airplane slid to a stop toward the left side of the runway. When the pilot 
was asked how the accident could have been prevented, he stated that he should have 
performed an aborted landing after the first bounce. Examination of the airplane revealed 
structural damage to the engine firewall, engine mount, and the rudder. The student pilot 
stated that he did not experience any mechanical problems with the airplane before the 
accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
