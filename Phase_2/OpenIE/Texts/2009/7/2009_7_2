Registration:
N261RA
Aircraft:
Remos G-3/6000
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The instructor pilot reported that she preflighted the fuel quantity of the high-wing Special 
Light Sport Aircraft (S-LSA) by looking at the fuel quantity tube that was located between the 
pilots™ seats. She reported that it indicated 1/2 tank, or about 11 gallons of fuel. The pilot 
departed on a demonstration flight. After approximately 30 minutes of flight, the pilot was 
returning to the airport when the engine stopped. The engine was restarted, but stopped again 
about one minute later. The engine stopped and was restarted about five times. The pilot 
executed a forced landing to a field, and the airplane nosed over during the landing roll. 
Inspection of the fuel system revealed that it was empty; the engine ran when fuel was 
provided. The inspection of the fuel quantity tube revealed that it was ﬁdiscolored,ﬂ and that 
there was a crease in the tube at the half-way point. The pilot reported that the crease in the 
tube made it appear that there was 1/2 tank of fuel. The airplane was also equipped with a fuel 
quantity gauge on the instrument panel which operated normally.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of total engine power due to fuel exhaustion as a result of the instructor pilot's 
inadequate preflight inspection. Contributing to the accident was the creased fuel quantity 
tube.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=74194
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
