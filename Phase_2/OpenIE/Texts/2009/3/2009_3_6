Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
During a local personal flight, the engine of the amateur-built airplane lost power without 
warning. The pilot looked for a field to land in, but overshot the field and impacted desert 
terrain.  During the crash sequence, the aircraft sustained substantial damage to both of the 
wings, the landing gear, and the firewall. Examination of the engine found that the rear 
connecting rod at the crankshaft journal was separated and exhibited severe heat distress 
signatures consistent with oil starvation to the bearing. The respective crankshaft journal 
displayed a dark black/blue coloration consistent with heat distress. The forward crankshaft 
journal and connecting rod remained undamaged.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A total loss of engine power due to oil starvation to the rear crankshaft journal.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
