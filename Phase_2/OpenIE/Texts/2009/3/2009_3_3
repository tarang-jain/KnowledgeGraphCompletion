Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot was on takeoff roll for runway 30 when he reported a gust of wind pushed the 
airplane to the right side of the runway.  The pilot's attempts to correct were unsuccessful.  As 
the airplane left the runway it veered to the right and down a sloped embankment. The pilot 
was still attempting to regain directional control but the airplane became airborne and stalled, 
contacting the ground with the right wing and collapsing the right main landing gear.  The 
airplane then cartwheeled on the right wing and came to rest upright.  The pilot was able to exit 
the airplane normally and was not injured.  Substantial damage was confirmed to the right 
wings and right main landing gear.  Winds reported from the nearest weather observation 
facility 17 miles to the south were 180 degrees at 8 knots gusting to 15 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's loss of control during take off. Contributing to the accident was the crosswind 
component.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
