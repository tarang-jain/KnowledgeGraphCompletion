Location:
Skwentna, AK
Accident Number:
ANC09CA076
Date & Time:
08/01/2009, 1800 AKD 
Registration:
N7509K
Aircraft:
PIPER PA-18
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Collision during takeoff/land
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The private pilot reported that he was landing his tailwheel-equipped airplane at his remote, 
650-foot-long private airstrip, at the conclusion of a personal cross-country flight operated 
under Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. He said that wind conditions required an 
easterly approach, over an area of stump-covered, 
down sloping terrain. During the approach, the airplane™s right main wheel struck a tree stump 
at the approach end of the site, and the airplane subsequently nosed over. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage. The pilot reported that 
there were no preaccident mechanical problems with the airplane. In his written report to the 
NTSB, the pilot noted that the accident might have been avoided if he had waited until wind 
conditions allowed for a different approach, or if he had waited to reduce engine power after 
clearance with the stump was ensured.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s misjudged landing on a downsloping, short landing strip, resulting in a nose over.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=74435
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
