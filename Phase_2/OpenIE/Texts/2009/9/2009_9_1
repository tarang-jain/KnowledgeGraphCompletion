Analysis   
The airplane was landing at a 2,100-foot-long dirt and turf remote mountain airstrip in dry 
conditions with clear skies and calm wind. During the flare and initial touchdown, the pilot 
allowed the airplane to drift to the left edge of the runway and the nose gear of the airplane 
struck a runway edge marker. According to the pilot, that impact "forcefully bounced the 
aircraft back in the air while dragging the tail." The airplane then "landed hard but 
controllably" on the left edge of the runway and the pilot steered the airplane back onto the 
runway. There was substantial damage to the forward fuselage and nose gear, but no injuries to 
the pilot.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing and his failure to execute a go-
around.
Findings

Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
