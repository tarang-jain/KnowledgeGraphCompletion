Accident Number:
WPR09CA225
Date & Time:
05/01/2009, 1330 MDT 
Registration:
N4272M
Aircraft:
RANS S-7
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel starvation
Injuries:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot/owner and a pilot rated passenger flew to a local airport for a brief stop, and then 
continued to another nearby airport where the passenger performed a touch-and-go. He had 
begun a slight right turn during the climbout from the touch-and-go when the engine lost 
power about 250 feet above ground level (agl). The owner took control, turned back to the left, 
and tried to land on the end of the runway. He leveled off slightly about 20 feet agl, and then 
flared for landing. The airplane landed hard on the north side of the runway and the right 
wheel broke off. The landing gear dug into the turf, the airplane spun 180 degrees, and the 
right main landing gear collapsed. The airframe around the tailwheel and rudder sustained 
substantial damage. The owner indicated that the airplane had a header tank that was the only 
fuel supply for the engine in addition to the wing tanks that were used to supply the header 
tank. He used an electric fuel pump to manually transfer fuel from the wing tanks to the header 
tank. He stated that he usually did not let the header tank get less than half full since the fuel 
pick-up port for the engine driven pump is at the front of the tank. He said that he probably let 
the fuel level get too low on this flight. During the climbout with the nose up, he surmised that 
the header tank fuel pick-up unported, resulting in the loss of power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A loss of engine power due to fuel starvation as a result of the pilot's inadequate fuel 
management.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
