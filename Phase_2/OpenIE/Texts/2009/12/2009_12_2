Analysis   
According to the pilot, he conducted a preflight inspection before taking off from the paved, 
2,000-foot runway. The takeoff was "normal," but the airplane's climb rate was "not enough to 
clear trees" at the end of the runway. According to a Federal Aviation Administration inspector, 
the airplane lifted off about 1,500 feet down the runway. The airplane's right wing 
subsequently hit a tree located to the right of the runway and sustained substantial damage. 
The inspector also reported no mechanical anomalies and confirmed compression on all engine 
cylinders. Photographs of the tree indicated that it was about 50 feet beyond and 50 feet to the 
right of the runway. Straight out and to the left of runway provided a relatively clear pathway. 
Using the ambient weather conditions, including a 6-knot headwind, the only takeoff 
performance data available in the pilot's operating handbook indicated that the airplane's 
takeoff distance to clear a 50-foot obstacle should have been approximately 1,450 feet.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate visual lookout and failure to maintain clearance from a tree.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
