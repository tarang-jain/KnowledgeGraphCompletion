Analysis 
The private pilot departed for a short local flight while visual meteorological conditions existed 
in the immediate vicinity of the departure airport. He proceeded to climb to the northeast, 
through a mountain pass, and then to the south, paralleling the shore of a frozen, snow-
covered reservoir. The flight continued for about 20 miles.  Analysis of radar and recorded GPS 
data showed that the airplane then experienced large fluctuations in ground speed while still 
on the same approximate track. Shortly thereafter, the airplane began a 180-degree left turn 
and collided with the reservoir surface. GPS data, airplane instrumentation, and ground scars 
indicated that the airplane was in a descending left turn when it struck the ground. All major 
sections of airplane were accounted for at the accident site, and post accident examination of 
the engine and airframe revealed no obvious anomalies that would have precluded normal 
operation. Mountain obscuration and occasional precipitation were forecast for the area of the 
accident flight. Additionally, weather observation stations and local pilot reports indicated that 
moderate snow showers were in the vicinity of the site at the time of the accident. The white 
surface of the frozen lake, in conjunction with the snow and limited visibility, would have 
provided the pilot limited external visual references, and as such could have resulted in him 
becoming spatially disoriented or affected by a visual illusion. The pilot's logbooks revealed 
that he had a history of flying in marginal weather conditions, and had performed multiple 
Special VFR takeoffs and landings. The pilot did not possess an instrument rating.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper decision to continue flight into an area of reduced visibility and snow 
showers during cruise flight, which resulted in the pilot's spatial disorientation and subsequent 
loss of aircraft control.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT 
On April 1, 2009, about 1630 mountain daylight time, a Maule M-4-220C, N2007U, impacted 
the frozen surface of a reservoir near Hungry Horse, Montana. The pilot was operating the 
airplane under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The certificated 
private pilot was killed; the airplane was destroyed by impact forces. The personal local flight 
departed Glacier Park International Airport (KGPI), Kalispell, Montana, at 1602. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the departure airport, and no flight plan had been filed.
Radar data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that a target 
departed Kalispell at 1602:48 using a discreet transponder code of 1200. The target climbed on 
a northeast course to 4,500 feet mean sea level (msl) as reported by the mode C transponder. 
Three miles northeast of the departure airport the target made a 360-degree left turn before 
continuing on the original track. Over the course of the next 2 minutes the target continued 
climbing until 1608:36; this was the last radar return and was received at an altitude of 5,100 
feet, about 2 miles west of the town of Hungry Horse.
A handheld global positioning systems (GPS) Garmin GPS III was recovered from the airplane. 
The unit was sent to the National Transportation Safety Board Office of Research and 
Engineering for data extraction. The data revealed a flight track that closely matched the radar 
data and did not contain altitude information. The airplane flew about 1 mile beyond the last 
radar return, and then changed course to the southeast. For the next 11 minutes the airplane 
followed the western shore of the reservoir, covering a distance of about 20 miles. Ground 
speeds for this portion of the flight fluctuated between 121 and 155 mph. Shortly thereafter, the 
airplane changed course to the south, and its ground speed increased to 161 mph. Six seconds 
later the ground speed slowed to 96 mph, and then back up to 132 mph, 8 seconds later. The 
airplane changed course back to the southeast and continued at a ground speed between 123 
and 140 mph for the remaining 2 1/2 minutes. The airplane then began a left turn to the north. 
The final GPS recorded location occurred 14 seconds later, with the airplane traveling at a 
velocity of about 146 mph, on a heading of 10 degrees true.
The Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC) received an indication of the activation of 
a 406 MHz Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) at 1629 in the vicinity of the Hungry Horse 
Reservoir. The airplane then became subject of an Alert Notice (ALNOT) after the pilot could 
not be reached by the AFRCC, and family members confirmed that he had not returned home.
A joint search was initiated by the Flathead County Sheriff's department and the Montana 
State Fish, Wildlife and Parks Division, and at 0020 the following morning the wreckage was 
located.
The wreckage was situated on the frozen surface of the 35-mile-long Hungry Horse Reservoir, 
26 miles southeast of the town of Hungry Horse.
The sheriff's department rescue coordinator reported that snow and cloud obscuration 
prevented the search from being initiated from the air. Additionally, the airplane was covered 
with fresh snow when first responders arrived on scene.
Earlier in the day, the pilot reported to family members that the flight was to be a short 
sightseeing flight, and that he would return later in the evening.

PERSONNEL INFORMATION
A review of FAA airman records revealed that the 50-year-old pilot held a private pilot 
certificate for airplane single-engine land, issued June 19, 2004. He did not possess an 
instrument rating. He held a third-class airman medical certificate issued in February 2008, 
with the limitation that he must have glasses available for near vision. Review of the pilot's 
logbooks revealed that as of March 20, 2009, he had accumulated about 609 hours of total 
flight experience, about 496 of which were in the accident airplane. He reported 7.1 hours of 
simulated instrument time.
The pilot's logbook contained multiple references to flights in snow and marginal VFR 
conditions, in addition to Special VFR takeoffs and landings. Excerpts from the logbook entries 
include:

AIRPLANE INFORMATION
The four-seat, high-wing, fixed-gear airplane, was manufactured in 1967. It was powered by a 
six cylinder, normally aspirated Franklin, PZLF-6A-350C1R engine, and equipped with a two 
blade McCauley constant-speed propeller. The maintenance logbooks were not recovered for 
inspection, however, an invoice retained from Poorman Aviation of Bigfork Montana, revealed 
that the airplane last received an annual inspection on December 18, 2008, at a total airframe 
time of 2,161.6 flight hours. The engine tachometer at the accident site indicated 2174.98.
The airplane was equipped with attitude, direction, and navigation instruments required for 
flight in instrument meteorological conditions.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
The closest aviation weather observation station was located at Kalispell, 28 miles northwest of 
the accident site. The elevation of the weather observation station was 2,977 feet msl. 
An aviation routine weather report (METAR) for Kalispell was issued at 1555. It stated:
Winds from 260 degrees at 12 knots; visibility 10 miles; skies clear; temperature 07 degrees 
Celsius; dew point -06 degrees Celsius; altimeter 29.79 inches of mercury.

hour gusts to 2 miles per hour; moderate snow.
1637 MDT: Temperature 30.6 degrees F; dew point 24.6 degrees F; winds east-southeast at 2 
miles per hour gusts to 2 miles per hour; moderate snow. 
An Airmen's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) Sierra Update 4 for mountain obscuration 
and occasional precipitation was issued on the day of the accident at 1445 MDT, and valid until 
2100 MDT. The accident site was located within the area covered by this advisory.
A pilot flying in the Kalispell area about the time of the accident reported that he was 
descending from 13,500 feet, and in the clouds, when he heard an ELT signal over his radio. He 
continued the descent, breaking out of the clouds at 6,000 feet. He stated that below this 
altitude the weather consisted of scattered clouds and intermittent snow showers. Additionally, 
he reported that the peaks of the Flathead Mountains, east of Kalispell, were obscured by 
clouds.
The FAA reported that Lockheed Martin Flight Services had provided no weather-related 
services to N2007U on day of the accident.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The accident site was located in the center of a 1-mile-wide section of the reservoir, at an 
elevation of 3,564 feet msl. The site was flanked to the east and west by the peaks of the 
Flathead Mountain Range. The elevation of the peaks directly to the east and west was 8,396 
and 7,542 feet, respectively.
The Safety Board investigator-in-charge (IIC) and representatives from the FAA examined the 
airplane at the accident site. The recovery and examination process was hampered by snowfall 
that had occurred since the accident, and the subsequent melting of the reservoir's ice surface.
The First Identified Point of Contact (FIPC) was characterized by a 10-inch-deep, 14-foot-long 
swath of excavated snow and ice. The ground excavation was oriented on a bearing of about 
345 degrees magnetic. Outboard sections of the left leading edge wing skins, as well as the red 
wing tip navigation light were located 10 feet beyond the FIPC. A second ground scar was 
observed 16 feet east, and 14 feet beyond the FIPC. This scar was about 20 feet long, 6 feet 
wide, and 18 inches deep. A section of engine cowling and engine oil line hosing were located in 
the center of the ground scar. The propeller and vacuum pump were located about 100 feet 
Page 6 of 9WPR09FA176
northeast of the ground scar, and five intermittent indentations were noted in the snow leading 
to the propeller.
The debris path continued on a bearing of 330 degrees. Outboard sections of the right leading 
edge wing skins, and the green wing tip navigation light were located 80 feet beyond the FIPC. 
The remainder of the debris path leading to the main wreckage contained various pieces of 
clear plastic, fuselage material, fragments of the engine intake manifold, and the left main 
landing gear structure.
The main wreckage came to rest 270 feet beyond the FIPC. The cabin area rested inverted and 
sustained crush damage from the firewall through to the rear passenger seat. The tail section 
was observed intact, upright, and folded back over the cabin area. The right horizontal 
stabilizer and elevator had folded forward. The engine came to rest inverted on a heading of 
230 degrees, and was still attached to the firewall by its associated control cables and hoses. Oil 
was noted in the snow surrounding the engine.
The left and right wings were observed inverted, and partially attached to the main cabin area 
by their associated control cables. Both wings sustained similar leading edge crush damage 
beginning 4 feet inboard of the tip, and emanating at a 45-degree angle aft towards the trailing 
edge of the wing tip. Both wing spars were exposed and exhibited 15 degrees upward buckling 
at the wing strut. Both fuel tanks were breached, and the odor of fuel was present at the site.
The instrument panel sustained crush damage. The airspeed indicator displayed a speed of 128 
mph; white transfer marks were noted on the instrument face, directly underneath the white 
indicator needle. The vertical speed indicator displayed a 500-foot per minute descent rate. 
The altimeter displayed a setting of 29.79 inches of mercury in the Kollsman window.
The magneto switch was observed in the both position; additionally, the carburetor heat, 
throttle, fuel mixture, and propeller governor controls were in the full forward position.
All major sections of airplane were accounted for at the accident site.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
A postmortem examination was conducted by the State of Montana Forensic Science Division. 
The cause of death was reported as the effect of blunt force injuries.
Toxicological tests on specimens from the pilot were performed by the FAA Civil Aeromedical 
Institute. Analysis revealed no findings for carbon monoxide, or cyanide. The results were 
negative for all screened drug substances and ingested alcohol.
TESTS AND RESEARCH
The airplane and engine were recovered from the accident site and examined at a storage 
facility in Kalispell.
The examination revealed no obvious anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. 
A full report of the examination is contained within the public docket for this accident.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Fueling records indicated that the airplane had been serviced with the addition of 13 gallons of 
aviation gasoline on March 20, 2009, 0.4 flight hours prior to the accident. A notation in a fuel 
logbook located within the airplane stated that at the time of the last refueling, the tanks were 
filled to their maximum capacity.
Page 7 of 9WPR09FA176
The airplane was equipped with a Kannad 406 MHz ELT, model 406 AF-COMPACT. The ELT 
was not configured to provide a GPS location, however, the AFRCC was able to provide search 
and rescue personnel with coordinates that were about 800 feet from the accident site.
FAA Advisory Circular 60-4A states in part, "The attitude of an aircraft is generally determined 
by reference to the natural horizon or other visual references with the surface. If neither 
horizon nor surface references exist, the attitude of an aircraft must be determined by artificial 
means from the flight instruments. Sight, supported by other senses, allows the pilot to 
maintain orientation. However, during periods of low visibility, the supporting senses 
sometimes conflict with what is seen. When this happens, a pilot is particularly vulnerable to 
disorientation. The degree of orientation may vary considerably with individual pilots. Spatial 
disorientation to a pilot means simply the inability to tell which way is ‚up.™...Surface references 
and the natural horizon may at times become obscured, although visibility may be above flight 
rule minimums. Lack of natural horizon or such reference is common on over water flights, at 
night, and especially at night in extremely sparsely populated areas, or in low visibility 
conditions.... The disoriented pilot may place the aircraft in a dangerous attitude... Therefore, 
the use of flight instruments is essential to maintain proper attitude when encountering any of 
the elements which may result in spatial disorientation."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
