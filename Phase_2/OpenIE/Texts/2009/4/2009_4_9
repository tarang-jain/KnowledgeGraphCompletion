Analysis   
The solo private pilot was landing a wheel-equipped airplane at an off-airport, snow-covered 
site. During the landing roll, the airplane bounced when it encountered a small snowdrift. The 
pilot said that he attempted to recover but the airplane drifted to the right and nosed over 
when it touched down in deep snow. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the vertical 
stabilizer, rudder, and wing lift struts. The pilot said there were no preaccident mechanical 
problems with the airplane, and noted in his report to the NTSB that he should have selected a 
better area to land on.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
