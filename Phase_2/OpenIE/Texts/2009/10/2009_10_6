Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Non-scheduled
Analysis 
The pilot taxied into the parking area, which appeared to be level from his perspective in the 
cockpit. Although the checklist called for setting the parking brake, the pilot elected to not use 
it since there were several chocks available on the ramp and no movement of the airplane was 
observed. He walked back to open the passenger door when the airplane began rolling 
backwards and impacted the windshield of a parked car. Although the parking area appeared 
level, the pilot indicated that later analysis showed there was a gradual slope.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to follow the manufacturer™s checklist and set the parking brake.
Findings
Aircraft
Parking/storage - Not specified (Cause)
Personnel issues

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
