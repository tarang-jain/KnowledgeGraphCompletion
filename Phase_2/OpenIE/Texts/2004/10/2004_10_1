Analysis   
According to the pilot, he was performing touch and go landings on runway 20. During the 
landing roll, the pilot encountered a wind gust from the left which "weather cocked the plane to 
about 15 degrees left of centerline." The pilot stated that he applied power and full right rudder 
but was not able to straighten the airplane. He reduced engine power and applied brakes. The 
aircraft looped to the left and the right wing and elevator impacted the runway causing 
substantial damage. An inspection of the airplane systems revealed no anomalies. According to 
the Aviation Routine Weather Report at 1502 winds were recorded as 150 degrees at 7 knots 
with gusts to 15 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control during the landing roll resulting in a ground loop. 
Contributing to the accident was the crosswind.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
