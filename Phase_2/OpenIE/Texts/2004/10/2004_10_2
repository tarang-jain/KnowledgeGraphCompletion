The airplane collided with a ditch during taxi and sustained substantial damage.  Night visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed.  While taxiing to the terminal, the pilot taxied into a non-
movement area of the airport, and did not see a 4-foot-deep ditch located in front of the 
terminal.  The airplane impacted the ditch and the right wing collided with the ground, 
resulting in damage to a stringer.  The ditch was approximately 45 feet from the taxiway.
Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
