Analysis 
Shortly after takeoff the airplane collided with trees and rising terrain.  In a written statement 
the pilot reported the airplane collided with trees and rising terrain after departing runway 12.

of the departure runway, however, the aircraft made contact with multiple trees and rising 
terrain beyond the departure end of the runway.  The pilot stated "we hit trees for 150 yards 
before slowing enough to hit the ground."  The published airport elevation for Benchmark is 
5,434 feet MSL.  No mechanical malfunctions or failures that may have contributed to the 
accident were reported.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
