Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The airplane sustained substantial damage on impact with trees during a circling instrument 
approach.  The pilot stated, "Descended to 1340 msl [mean sea level] and continued to 20 DME 
but did not clear clouds.  Descended to 1100 msl and broke through at south end of runway.  
Remained clear of clouds and entered left, downwind circling approach to rwy [runway] 15 and 
proceeded with circling north entry.  Clipped uppermost small branches of a tree with left wing 
in the middle of the turn, pulled aircraft higher for clearance and continued approx 1/4 to 1/2 
mile to land on rwy 15 without further incident."   Weather was: Wind 190 degrees at 12 knots, 
gusting to 17 knots; 3 statute miles visibility; present weather mist; sky condition overcast 300 
feet above ground level; altimeter 29.87 inches of mercury.  Remarks rain began at 1416 and 
rain ended at 1428.  According to the published instrument approach procedure the circling 
minimum descent altitude was 1,340 feet msl and its weather minima was 1 statute mile 
visibility.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot not maintaining altitude/clearance from the trees during the circling approach, his 
continued descent below minimum descent altitude, and the pilot not performing a missed 
approach.  A factor was the trees the pilot impacted during the circling approach.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On January 2, 2004, about 1420 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-32RT-300, N21992, piloted 
by an instrument-rated private pilot, sustained substantial damage on impact with trees during 
a circling instrument approach to runway 15 at the Indianapolis Metropolitan Airport (UMP), 
near Fishers, Indiana.  The personal flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 91.  Instrument 
meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed at the time of the accident.  An Instrument Flight 
Rules (IFR) flight plan was on file and was activated.  The pilot and his three passengers 
reported no injuries.  The flight originated from the Huntsville International Airport-Carl T 
Jones Field (HSV), near Huntsville, Alabama, about 1210 and landed at UMP, its destination.
The pilot stated:
N21992 Received standard flight briefing and filed an IFR flight plan with 
Anniston, AL FSS [Flight Service Station], on Friday morning, 1-2-04.  
UMP was projected to have 700 feet msl [mean sea level] ceilings 
by our arrival time at 1300 hours CST. Departed HSV at 
approximately 1110 hours CST, enroute direct SHB [Shelbyville] 
VOR, direct UMP.  ... Weather at IND [Indianapolis International 
Airport] was visibility 1 [statute mile], [overcast] at 300 msl with winds 180 at 
12 [knots].  ATC advised N21992 that 2 aircraft had tried to land at UMP 
earlier that morning, but both had shot missed approaches.  Pilot told 
Indy approach control that he still wanted to try the approach and 
permission was granted.  Crossed SHB VOR at 3000 msl, picked up 
the 330 radial and descended to 2400 msl to begin the approach.  
Tracked radial to 15 DME [distance measuring equipment] and 
began descent at APPIE [intersection].  Descended to 1340 msl 
and continued to 20 DME but did not clear clouds.  Descended to 
1100 msl and broke through at south end of runway.  Remained 
clear of clouds and entered left, downwind circling approach to 
rwy [runway] 15 and proceeded with circling north entry.  Clipped 
uppermost small branches of a tree with left wing in the middle of 
the turn, pulled aircraft higher for clearance and continued approx 
1/4 to 1/2 mile to land on rwy 15 without further incident.  Flight 
was 2:09 minutes long. 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) interviewed a witness.  The FAA's record of 
interview with that witness stated:
Page 4 of 8CHI04LA052
The aircraft was at full power as it was [making] more noise than normal 
aircraft on landing.  The wings were rocking back [and] forth (Top-Gun). 
Looked like it was going to hit the chimney of the house across the 
street.
DAMAGE TO AIRCRAFT
The pilot reported that the damage to the airplane was multiple light dents on the left wing, 
from main gear to wing tip.  He said that a substantial dent was present in the left wing 
approximately 24 inches inboard from the wing tip.  The frontal area of fiberglass wing tip was 
damaged and the strobe light/positioning light was broken.  A slight dent was noticed on the 
left aileron.
 
Pictures revealed a semicircular dent in the leading edge of the left wing.  The dented area 
appeared to be crushed rearward about four inches.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
The pilot held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single engine land and 
instrument airplane operations.  The pilot reported that his last medical examination was 
conducted on August 14, 2002, and that he was issued a third-class medical certificate with a 
limitation for corrective lenses.
According to the pilot's report, he had accumulated a total flight time of 1,320 hours and his 
last flight review was completed on July 9, 2002.  The pilot reported a total of 158 hours in 
actual IMC and 45 hours as simulated IMC.  The pilot's last recorded instrument proficiency 
check was completed on July 9, 2002.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
N21992 was a 1978, Piper PA-32RT-300, Lance, serial number 32R-7885265.  The Lance was a 
low-wing monoplane of all metal construction and was equipped with a constant-speed 
propeller, wing flaps, and retractable landing gear.  Its engine was a 300 horsepower Lycoming 
IO-540-K1G5D, serial number L-18528-48A.  The Lance can accommodate a pilot and up to 
five passengers.  The pilot reported that the airframe and engine had accumulated 2,475 hours 
total time and that the last annual inspection of the airplane was on September 25, 2003.  The 
airplane had accumulated 23 hours since that inspection.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
Forecasted weather at the time of the accident was IMC.  An IFR weather briefing and flight 
plan was filed with Anniston FSS. 
The aviation area forecast at 1050 was as follows for Indiana:
Page 5 of 8CHI04LA052
The northern half of the state was forecast to be overcast at 1,000 feet mean sea level (msl) 
with cloud tops at 6,000 feet msl.  Visibility is 3-5 statute miles with mist.  Outlook is reported 
as marginal visual flight rules (MVFR).
The southern half of Indiana was forecast to be overcast at 1,000 feet msl layered up to 25,000 
feet msl.  After 1500 it will become overcast at 4,000 feet above ground level (agl), topping out 
at 6,000 feet agl.
At 1433, the Eagle Creek Airport, near Indianapolis, Indiana, located 13 nautical miles and 241 
degrees from UMP, recorded weather was: Wind 190 degrees at 12 knots, gusting to 17 knots; 3 
statute miles visibility; present weather mist; sky condition overcast 300 feet agl; altimeter 
29.87 inches of mercury.  Remarks: Rain began at 1416 and rain ended at 1428.
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
According to the published instrument approach procedure for the VOR runway 33 approach 
at UMP, the final approach course was 330 degrees, the category A circling minimum descent 
altitude was 1,340 feet msl, and its weather minima was 1 statute mile visibility.  APPIE 
intersection is listed as that approach's final approach fix.  The missed approach point is listed 
as 5.5 nautical miles from the final approach fix.
AIRPORT INFORMATION
The East Central US Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD) indicated UMP's field elevation was 811 
feet.  The A/FD listed one runway, 15/33.  That runway was asphalt-surfaced, 3,850 feet long, 
and 100 feet wide.  A precision approach path indicator services both ends of that runway.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The FAA was a party to the investigation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
