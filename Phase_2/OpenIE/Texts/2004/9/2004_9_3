Aircraft:
Cessna 172S

Destroyed

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
While maneuvering to locate the runway during a dark, nighttime flight, the airplane 
descended until colliding with trees.  As the pilot approached his home base airport, he 
attempted to activate the pilot controlled runway lights.  However, he was unsuccessful.  
Thereafter, the pilot performed a low altitude pass over what he believed was runway 16/34 to 
ascertain if a portion of the runway's lights were operating.  During the maneuver, the pilot 
failed to detect that the airplane was not aligned with the runway.  Also, the pilot failed to 
maintain adequate altitude to avoid colliding with trees 1/8-mile west of the airport.  Neither 
prior to taking off, nor at any time during the accident flight, did the pilot become aware that a 
Notice to Airman had been issued indicating that the airport's runway lights were "out of 
service."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's inadvertent descent and controlled flight into obstacles while maneuvering to land.  
Contributing factors were the dark, nighttime condition, which impaired the pilot's visual 
perceptions, and the pilot's failure to obtain a pertinent Notice to Airman regarding inoperative 
runway lights.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
