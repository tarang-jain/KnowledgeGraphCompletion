Analysis   
A rental airplane received substantial damage on impact with a road during an aborted landing 
on runway 36 (2,155 feet by 70 feet, dry asphalt).  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at 
the time of the accident with southerly winds.  The pilot stated that he touched down, 
"dumped" the flaps, and made a decision that he needed to go-around.  He applied full power 
and tried to clear the black top road at the end of the runway.  He stated that the road was 
higher than the runway and had a 2-3 foot "build up" over the road bed.  The main landing gear 
hit the lip on the black top.  The left main landing gear separated from the airplane, and the 
right main landing gear was bent.  He then departed and landed at an alternate airport.  The 
Airport Facility Directory lists runway 36 as having a displaced threshold of 518 feet.  A "road" 
is also listed under runway 36.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The proper touchdown point not attained by the pilot during landing.  The road and tailwind 
were contributing factors.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
