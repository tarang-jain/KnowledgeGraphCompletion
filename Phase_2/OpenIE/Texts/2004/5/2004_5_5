Substantial
Defining Event:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The airplane experienced a hard landing and veered off the runway.  The pilot began a 
standard stabilized approach and intended to level off about 10 feet above ground level, in an 
effort to let the airspeed gradually slow down.  The airplane continued in a descent faster than 
the pilot anticipated, and the airplane hit the runway surface hard.  The airplane bounced back 
into the air and porpoised down the runway, veering to the right.  The airplane continued off of 
the runway into a dirt area and impacted a taxiway sign.  The pilot reported no preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's inadequate flare, which resulted in a hard landing.  Also causal was the pilot's 
inadequate recovery from a bounced landing, which resulted in an inadvertent porpoise and 
collision with a sign.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
