Factual Information
On February 7, 2004, at 1245 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-28-161, N21266, registered to 
and operated by a private owner, taxied unmanned into a parked airplane at Summerville 
Airport, Summerville, South Carolina. The personal flight was operated under the provisions of 
Title 14 CFR Part 91 with no flight plan filed. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed. The 
private pilot received minor injuries, and the airplane and a parked airplane sustained 
substantial damage. The flight was originating from Summerville, South Carolina, at the time 
of the accident.
The pilot was preparing for a flight to Columbia, South Carolina, to deliver the airplane for 
avionics maintenance. The pilot stated that when he engaged the starter, it made a spinning 
noise, and the airplane would not start. The pilot set the parking brake and attempted to start 
the airplane by rotating the propeller by hand. The airplane started and moved forward, and 
the pilot climbed up on the right wing to enter the cockpit but slipped and fell to the ground. 
The pilot grabbed onto the cabin step and was dragged as he attempted to gain access to the 
cockpit. When the pilot realized a collision with a parked airplane was imminent, he released 
his hold on the cabin step. The airplane taxied unmanned and collided with a parked airplane.
Examination of the airplane revealed damage to the right wing spar and propeller, and the 
parked airplane sustained damage to the fuselage and left wing. The pilot reported no 
mechanical malfunction with the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
