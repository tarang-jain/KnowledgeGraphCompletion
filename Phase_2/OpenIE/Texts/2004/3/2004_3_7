Aircraft:
Cessna 170A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The private certificated pilot attempted to takeoff in his ski-equipped tailwheel airplane from a 
snow covered runway.  He reported that the airplane didn't seem to accelerate as quickly as it 
normally did, which he attributed to the snow condition.  The airplane lifted off and settled 
onto the runway three times before the pilot aborted the takeoff.  He was unable to stop the 
airplane on the runway, and it ran off the end and collided with a snowbank, receiving 
substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and horizontal stabilizer.  The pilot wrote in his 
report to the NTSB that the accident could have been prevented "by aborting the takeoff in a 
timely manner."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's delayed response  in initiating an aborted takeoff, which resulted in an overrun and 
collision with a snowbank.

Factual Information
On March 5, 2004, about 1130 Alaska daylight time, a ski-equipped Cessna 170A airplane, 
N515N, received substantial damage when it collided with a snowbank during an aborted 
takeoff from the Bradley Sky Ranch airstrip, North Pole, Alaska.  The private pilot/airplane 
owner and the sole passenger were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for 
the 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight, and no flight plan was filed.  The flight was originating at 
the time of the accident, and the intended destination was a remote, off-airport site about 100 
miles north of Fort Yukon, Alaska.
During a telephone conversation with the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC) on March 5, at 
1430, the pilot related that he was departing on runway 33, which was snow covered and 3,400 
feet long. He described the snow on the airstrip as "soft and sticky."  He said the airplane didn't 
seem to accelerate as quickly as it normally did, which he attributed to the snow condition.  The 
airplane continued to accelerate slowly, lifted off, and then settled onto the airstrip.  The pilot 
said the airplane did this two more times, before he reduced the engine power and aborted the 
takeoff.  The airplane subsequently ran off the end of the runway and hit a snowbank, 
sustaining structural damage to the right wing, main landing gear gear box, right horizontal 
stabilizer, and left wing lift strut.
The pilot wrote in his report to the NTSB that the accident could have been prevented "by 
aborting the takeoff in a timely manner."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
