Analysis   
Prior to departure, the pilot checked the weather and noted a storm was moving toward the 
area, and determined he needed to depart as soon as possible. During takeoff and while in 
ground effect, the airplane encountered a gust of wind that pushed the airplane™s left wing 
down. The pilot regained control and continued to initiate a climb in order to clear trees that 
were located near the end of the runway. The airplane encountered another gust of wind and 
the pilot attempted to compensate for the wind gust. Subsequently, the airplane impacted trees 
and terrain, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings. The pilot 
stated there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that 
would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s failure to maintain aircraft control during initial climb in gusty wind conditions.
Findings

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=87957
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
