Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight

2 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot of the amateur-built, amphibious, light-sport airplane reported that the airplane 
accelerated and lifted off from the asphalt runway without incident; however, during the initial 
climb it encountered "severe turbulence." The pilot was not able to control the airplane and 
was attempting to return to the airport when it landed hard in a soy bean field, resulting in 
substantial damage to the fuselage. Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine 
revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal 
operation; nor did the pilot report any. The pilot reported that wind at the time of the accident 
was light and variable, with gusts up to 8 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain aircraft control during the initial climb after takeoff in gusty 
wind conditions, which resulted in a hard off-airport landing.
Findings

Performance/control parameters - Not attained/maintained (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
