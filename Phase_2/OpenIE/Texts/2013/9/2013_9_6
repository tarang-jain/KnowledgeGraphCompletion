Location:
Homedale, ID
Accident Number:
WPR13CA395
Date & Time:
09/01/2013, 0830 MDT 
Registration:
N212G
Aircraft:
BEECH C-50
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of lift
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that this was the first time landing his multi-engine airplane on his private 
grass airstrip. The flight handbook revealed that the required landing distance was about equal 
to the full length of the runway. The pilot reported performing a stabilized approach, with an 
intended touchdown point 200 feet down the runway. As he approached short final, the 
airplane began to sink, and he increased engine power. This did not arrest the descent, so he 
applied full engine power; however, the airplane touched down short of the runway and struck 
a fence post with the left wing, which resulted in substantial damage. The pilot reported no 
mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airframe or engine that would have precluded 
normal operation, and further stated that the accident could have been avoided if he had 
performed a go-around at the first indication of altitude loss.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
