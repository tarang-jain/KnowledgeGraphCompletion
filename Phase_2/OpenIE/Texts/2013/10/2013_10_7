Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that during a test flight the airplane encountered moderate turbulence so he 
decided to return to the airport for landing. While turning to the crosswind leg in the pattern, 
the airplane suddenly banked sharply and descended uncontrollably. The pilot was able to 
regain control about 500 feet above ground level, and managed to turn the airplane to the 
downwind leg, but he continued to have difficulty maintaining control. The pilot then decided 
to make an emergency off airport landing to a field. During the landing roll, the airplane 
collided with obstructions and nosed over. The wings and fuselage were substantially damaged. 
After the accident, the pilot reported that the loss of aircraft control was due to a jammed 
rudder for undetermined reasons.
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A jammed rudder control while maneuvering in the pattern for reasons that could not be 
determined. No follow-up examination was conducted due to a lapse in agency funding and 
subsequent government shutdown.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
