Analysis   
As the helicopter was flying west in the direction of the sun and at 250 feet above ground level, 
the pilot heard a loud "bang" and observed a black object go by the left side of the helicopter. 
The object struck the passenger-side windshield. The pilot performed a forced landing to a 
highway. During the forced landing, both landing skids separated and the helicopter slid to a 
stop. The lower fuselage was buckled and wrinkled in several locations. The pilot reported no 
preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter that would have precluded 
normal operation.

Note:

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=85955
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
