Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
North Las Vegas, NV
Accident Number:
WPR13LA082
Date & Time:
01/02/2013, 1515 PST 
Registration:
N3AG
Aircraft:
PIPER PA-60-602P
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Hard landing
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The pilot receiving instruction conducted three full-stop landings without incident. After the 
fourth takeoff, the flight instructor simulated a prearranged left engine failure about 600 ft 
above ground level (agl). The pilot followed emergency procedures, used the checklist, and 
prepared to land. The pilot reported that, when the airplane was about 50 to 100 ft agl on final 
approach, he thought that it was a little too high, so he chose to initiate a go-around. He moved 
the throttle levers full forward, but neither engine responded. The flight instructor pushed the 
airplane™s nose down, and the pilot continued the approach. On touchdown, the right main and 
nose landing gear collapsed. A postimpact fire ensued, which consumed most of the airplane. 
Postaccident examination of the landing gear revealed that it collapsed due to bending 
overload consistent with a hard landing. The reason for the failure of both engines to respond 
to power inputs could not be determined because of the postcrash fire damage. 
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s failure to maintain an adequate descent rate while on final approach, which resulted 
in a hard landing and landing gear collapse due to overload following the failure of both 
engines to respond to power inputs during an attempted go-around for reasons that could not 
be determined due to postcrash fire damage.

Factual Information
On January 2, 2013, about 1515 Pacific standard time, a Piper PA-60-602P, N3AG, veered off 
the runway during landing at North Las Vegas, Nevada. The pilot/owner was operating the 
airplane under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The private 
pilot receiving instruction and the flight instructor were not injured; the airplane sustained 
substantial damage from a post-crash fire. The local instructional flight departed North Las 
Vegas about 1430. Visual meteorological (VMC) conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had 
been filed.
The pilot remained in the traffic pattern after departure, and completed three full-stop 
landings without incident; one was on runway 12R, and the other two were on runway 12L. As 
prearranged with the flight instructor prior to departure, the fourth takeoff was a simulated left 
engine failure about 600 feet above ground level (agl). The pilot followed emergency 
procedures, used the checklist, and prepared to land.
About 50-100 feet agl on final, the pilot felt that the airplane was a little too high, and elected 
to initiate a go-around. The propeller and mixture controls were already full forward. 
Movement of the throttle levers full forward resulted in neither engine increasing in power. 
The flight instructor pushed the nose down. The airplane shuddered about 15 feet agl, but did 
not stall. The pilot pulled the nose back before touchdown, and landed on the main landing 
gear. He stated that touchdown was not hard; it felt like a normal landing.  The right wing went 
down immediately as if the right main landing gear had collapsed, and the airplane veered off 
the runway into a ditch in the infield.
The flight instructor noted that the airplane was on fire. The pilot shut down all power and the 
fuel mixture. It took three vigorous tries to open the upper clamshell door before the pilot and 
flight instructor could egress. Within a few moments of their exit, the airplane caught fire.
An airframe and powerplant (A&P) mechanic was working on the airport ramp. The A&P heard 
an airplane coming in for landing, and noted that the engine sounds were increasing and 
decreasing. He observed an airplane porpoising, and coming in fast. He thought that the 
airplane landed hard; the right main landing gear and nose landing gear collapsed on 
touchdown. The airplane caught fire within 40 to 50 feet after touchdown; it started sliding, 
and then it exited the runway surface.
The axle of the right main landing gear strut with the lower link still bolted to it was sent to the 
National Transportation Safety Board Office of Research and Engineering Materials 
Laboratory for examination.
A fractured piece of the piston was contained in the axle, and a portion of a fractured bolt was 
contained at the lower link connection to the upper link. Examination of the piston's fracture 
face revealed that it was oriented diagonally to the strut center line, and displayed a grainy 
surface with shear lips, consistent with a bending overload event. The fracture face on the 
lower link to upper link attachment bolt displayed grainy surfaces in a cup and cone formation 
with a distinct shear lip oriented in one direction, also consistent with a bending overload 
event.
Due to the postaccident fire damage, examination of the engines failed to reveal the reason why 
they did not respond to power input.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=85939
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
