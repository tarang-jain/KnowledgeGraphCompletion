Location:
Miami, FL
Accident Number:
ERA13LA187
Date & Time:
04/04/2013, 0840 EDT 
Registration:
N6141Q
Aircraft:
CESSNA 152
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
Near the conclusion of a local training flight, the airplane™s engine experienced a partial loss of 
power, and the flight instructor performed a forced landing to a road. The airplane departed 
the road during the landing, and the right wing was substantially damaged. Postaccident 
examination of the engine found that the No. 3 cylinder exhaust valve had fractured and 
separated from the valve stem. Review of maintenance records showed that the valve may have 
been installed during a repair to the No. 3 cylinder that occurred about 28 years before the 
accident flight; however, due to the incomplete nature of the records provided, a definitive 
determination of the engine™s complete service history could not be made. Recent engine log 
entries showed that the engine had accumulated nearly 2,500 flight hours since the most 
recent overhaul. The engine-manufacturer-recommended time between overhaul is every 
2,400 flight hours or 12 calendar years.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A partial loss of engine power due to the failure of the No. 3 exhaust valve. Contributing to the 
accident was the airplane operator™s failure to follow the engine manufacturer™s recommended 
engine overhaul intervals.

Factual Information
On April 4, 2013, at 0840 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 152, N6141Q, was substantially 
damaged during a forced landing following a partial loss of engine power near Miami, Florida.  
The certificated flight instructor and the certificated student pilot were not injured.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local flight, which 
originated from Kendall-Tamiami Executive Airport (TMB), Miami, Florida, at 0745. The 
instructional flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 91.  
At the conclusion of an uneventful training flight, the flight instructor asked the student pilot 
to demonstrate a steep turn prior to returning to TMB. While in the turn, the engine 
experienced a partial loss of power, and the propeller continued to ﬁwindmill.ﬂ The flight 
instructor then took control of the airplane and returned to straight-and-level flight before 
attempting to restore power to the engine. After determining that engine power could not be 
restored, and that the airplane would be unable to reach TMB from their current position, the 
flight instructor elected to perform a forced landing to a road. During the landing, the left main 
landing gear caught on a grassy area next to the runway, yawing the nose left. The airplane 
subsequently struck a bush, resulting in substantial damage to the right wing.
The engine was examined following the accident under the supervision of a Federal Aviation 
Administration inspector. Internal examination of the number 3 cylinder showed that the 
exhaust valve head had fractured and was separated from the valve stem. The valve head was 
recovered from the engine cylinder, and showed evidence of post-separation damage and 
contact with the interior of the cylinder and piston dome.
No other mechanical deficiencies of the engine were identified during the examination.
The accident airplane was manufactured in 1981 and was equipped with a Lycoming O-235-
L2C engine. Review of maintenance logs provided by the operator revealed that the engine was 
installed in the accident airplane following a field overhaul in June 1985. At the time of the 
overhaul, the engine had accumulated 1,994 total hours of operation. In December 1985, after 
the engine had accumulated 299 flight hours since the most recent overhaul, inspection of the 
number 3 cylinder revealed a broken rocker shaft boss. The remedy to the discrepancy 
included the installation of ﬁserviceable valves.ﬂ Between 1985 and the date of the accident, no 
other replacement of the number 3 cylinder or its valves was noted. No other documents 
accompanied the log entry, and the prior service history of the installed ﬁserviceableﬂ valves 
could not be determined.
Based on the maintenance records provided, the engine™s maintenance history between 1985 
and 2011 could not be determined; however review of an entry dated October 2011 noted that 
the engine had accumulated 1,876 total hours since its most recent overhaul. The airplane™s 
most recent annual inspection was completed on April 14, 2012. At that time the engine had 
accumulated 5,702 total hours, and 1,929 hours since overhaul. The most recent 100 hour 
inspection was completed on March 26, 2013, and at that time the engine had accumulated 
2,408 hours of operation since the most recent overhaul. At the time of the accident, the engine 
had accumulated 2,495 hours since the most recent overhaul, and 6,269 hours since its 
manufacture.
According to Lycoming Service Instruction 1009AS, revised May 25, 2006, the recommended

overhaul interval for the O-235 engine was 2,400 hours or 12 calendar years.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
