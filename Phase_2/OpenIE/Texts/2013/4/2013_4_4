Analysis   
The pilot and a passenger departed from a private airport in a tandem-seat, tailwheel-equipped 
airplane, destined for a public airport about 3 miles to the south. The pilot reported that he 
performed a "short field" landing to a full stop on runway 12 and then began a takeoff from the 
stopping point. The airplane veered to the right, the pilot applied corrective inputs, but the 
airplane exited the left side of the runway and ground looped. Both wings sustained substantial 
damage. The weather about the time of the accident included wind from 360 degrees at 6 
knots. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions and that he lost control 
due to a wind gust.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
