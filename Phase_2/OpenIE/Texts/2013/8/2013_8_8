Location:
Lago Vista, TX
Accident Number:
CEN13CA458
Date & Time:
08/03/2013, 1215 CDT 
Registration:
N6370T
Aircraft:
CESSNA R182
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot stated that she entered the traffic pattern for runway 15, and established a stabilized 
approach with the airplane configured for landing. She reported that the airplane touched 
down in the runway landing zone; however, the airplane bounced and she added engine power 
in order to stabilize the airplane. At that time, the airplane encountered a gust of wind which 
resulted in the left main landing gear departing the runway pavement. The pilot noted that she 
added full engine power to initiate a go-around, and the airplane pitched up due to the added 
power and the pitch trim positioned for landing approach. She attempted to reduce the flap 
deflection to 10 degrees; however, the flaps may have been raised completely contributing to an 
inadvertent aerodynamic stall at a low altitude. The pilot noted that there were no 
malfunctions or failures associated with the airplane prior to the accident. She commented that 
due to the local terrain it is common to experience some turbulence on approach to runway 15. 
She reported that the wind was from 170 degrees at 6 knots, with moderate turbulence. Wind 
conditions recorded at local airports were southerly at 10 to 13 knots, with gusts to 17 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s inadequate recovery from a bounced landing in crosswind conditions, and an 
inadvertent aerodynamic stall during the subsequent go-around attempt.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
