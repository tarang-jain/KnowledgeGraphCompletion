Analysis   
Prior to landing, the pilot listened to the automated weather station which reported the wind 
out of the west at 8 knots; the pilot would land on runway 21 for a normal crosswind landing. 
During the landing roll, the right wing lifted suddenly, the left wing contacted the ground, and 
the airplane ground looped. The pilot then asked the air traffic controller what the wind was, 
the air traffic controller responded that the wind was at 14 knots, gusting to 19 and getting 
stronger. Examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the left wing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s inadequate compensation for the crosswind, which resulted in a loss of directional 
control.
Findings

Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
