WPR13CA220
Date & Time:
05/01/2013, 1832 PDT 
Registration:
N88XC
Aircraft:
Adolphson CCK-1865
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The flight instructor and the private pilot were performing practice takeoff and landings in the 
amateur-built experimental airplane so the pilot could provide an assessment of the airplane's 
handling qualities. The flight instructor reported that the pilot made a normal approach with 
full flaps and that the pilot made a "good landing with a normal touchdown." The pilot then 
commented that "it's skittish alright," and the airplane began to enter a ground loop. The flight 
instructor took over the controls, but the airplane exited the runway, continued through at 
least a portion of the ground loop, and dragged the right wingtip on the ground. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage to some right wing ribs and the right aileron. The flight 
instructor reported that the tower air traffic controller stated that the wind was "light and 
variable at 4 knots" about that time. The pilot reported that this was his first flight in the 
accident airplane make and model. Neither the flight instructor nor the pilot reported any 
preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded 
normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing. Contributing to the accident 
was the flight instructor™s delayed remedial action.
Findings

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=86841
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
