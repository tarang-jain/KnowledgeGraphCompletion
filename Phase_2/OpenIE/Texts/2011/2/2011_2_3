Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Albuquerque, NM
Accident Number:
CEN11LA173
Date & Time:
02/03/2011, 0840 MST 
Registration:
N5802C
Aircraft:
CESSNA 402
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Landing gear collapse
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Non-scheduled
Analysis 
Shortly after takeoff, the hydraulic pressure caution light illuminated and the nose gear failed 
to retract when the pilot attempted to raise the gear. The pilot accomplished the appropriate 
emergency procedure checklists and unsafe gear indications remained. Following an approved 
flyover of the tower to verify gear position, the pilot performed a precautionary landing. During 
the landing the right main landing gear collapsed, resulting in substantial damage. Subsequent 
examination of the airplane and related hydraulic system components revealed no anomalies 
and the landing gear system operated normally during functional testing. The reason for the 
landing gear's failure could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the landing gear system for undetermined reasons.
Findings
Aircraft
Gear extension and retract sys - Failure (Cause)
Main landing gear - Damaged/degraded

Factual Information
On February 3, 2011, at 0840 mountain standard time, a Cessna 402C airplane, N5802C, was 
substantially damaged during landing at Albuquerque International Sunport Airport (ABQ), 
Albuquerque, New Mexico, following a hydraulic malfunction and subsequent collapse of the 
right main landing gear. The airline transport rated pilot was not injured. The non-scheduled 
cargo flight was being conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 
135 with a visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan. The flight originated at ABQ, with Las Vegas 
Municipal Airport (LVS), Las Vegas, New Mexico, as the intended destination. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.
The pilot stated that following gear retraction on initial takeoff from ABQ, the hydraulic 
pressure caution light illuminated and the nose landing gear failed to retract. The pilot 
accomplished the HYD PRESSURE LIGHT ILLUMINATED AFTER GEAR CYCLE and the 
LANDING GEAR WILL NOT EXTEND HYDRAULICALLY checklists and was left with unsafe 
gear indications. He performed an approved fly over of the ABQ tower and landed after tower 
personnel reported the gear appeared to be down. During the landing the right main landing 
gear collapsed, resulting in substantial damage to the right aileron. 
The airplane was examined by Federal Aviation Administration inspectors and the airplane's 
operator the day following the accident. The airplane was placed on jacks and the landing gear 
was functionally tested. The landing gear system was cycled and no anomalies were noted. The 
hydraulic control valve and the landing gear hydraulic shuttle valve were removed for 
functional testing and to check for contaminants. No anomalies were found with either unit.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
