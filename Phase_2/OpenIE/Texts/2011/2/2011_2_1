Analysis   
The pilot pulled the airplane out of the unheated hangar on a chilly morning and used the 
propeller to rotate the engine several times. He set the parking brake, and started the airplane 
with the starter, but then the engine stopped. The battery did not have sufficient charge to start 
the engine, so he decided to hand-prop the engine. He primed it, left the parking brake on, set 
the throttle to idle, turned the master switch and magneto switches on, and spun the propeller. 
The engine started but did not remain running. He started it again by hand propping. He 
advanced the throttle to keep it running, but again it did not remain running. He applied 
carburetor heat, but did not reduce the throttle setting. He hand-propped the engine once 
again and it went to a high rpm setting, and then the airplane began moving forward. The pilot 
reached in to try to retard the throttle, but was unsuccessful. He fell and hit his face on the 
landing gear footstep, which fractured his right cheekbone and caused deep lacerations above 
his right eye. The airplane continued to move until it collided with a hangar, with both wings 
sustaining substantial damage.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s failure to properly secure the airplane prior to rotating the propeller by hand, 
resulting in inadvertent movement of the airplane and collision with a building.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
