Analysis   
The pilot landed with a left crosswind and the airplane started veering to the right. The pilot 
removed the crosswind correction while applying the brakes with the brake handle which was 
located on the control stick. The airplane continued off the right side of the runway. The nose 
landing gear dug into the grass and the airplane nosed over inverted into a ditch. Both wings 
and the tail section sustained structural damage. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical 
problems with the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to compensate for crosswind conditions and loss of directional control 
during landing, resulting in a runway excursion and nose over.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
