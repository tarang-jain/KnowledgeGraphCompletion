Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot refueled his helicopter and was performing a takeoff from an area near the airport™s 
fuel pumps. As the helicopter began to lift, the pilot allowed the helicopter™s tail to remain in a 
low attitude. As a result, the aft end of the left skid contacted the ground and the helicopter 
experienced a dynamic rollover. The helicopter came to rest on its left side, resulting in 
substantial damage to the fuselage and tail boom. The pilot reported that there were no pre-
impact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s improper takeoff procedure, which resulted in a dynamic rollover when the left skid 
contacted the ground.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
