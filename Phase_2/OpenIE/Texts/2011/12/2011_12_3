Analysis   
The certified flight instructor (CFI) was demonstrating a touchdown autorotation from an 
altitude of 1,500 feet above ground level to a turf runway. He stated that, during the maneuver, 
the helicopter's sink rate seemed high, so he continued to pull pitch to arrest the descent rate. 
The helicopter touched down with a slight forward speed on a downhill slope, and the rear 
portion of the skids became momentarily stuck in the soft turf. The helicopter pitched forward 
after breaking loose from the turf, and the main rotor blade contacted the vertical stabilizers 
and tail rotor drive shaft cover, resulting in substantial damage. The CFI stated that there were 
no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies with the helicopter.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The certified flight instructor did not select an adequate landing site for the practice 
autorotation.

Note:

to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=82441
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
