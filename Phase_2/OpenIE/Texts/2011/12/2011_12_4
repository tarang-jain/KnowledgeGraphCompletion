Analysis   
After a brief local flight, the pilot returned to the departure airport. During the landing, the 
airplane touched down on the runway and bounced. The pilot again attempted to land the 
airplane; however, the airplane™s nose dropped, and the nose landing gear and propeller struck 
the runway, resulting in a second bounce. The airplane struck the runway again before the pilot 
regained control of it and taxied it to the hangar. A postaccident examination revealed that the 
airplane sustained substantial damage to the firewall. The pilot reported that there were no 
preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions of the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s inadequate recovery from a bounced landing, which resulted in a loss of control.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
