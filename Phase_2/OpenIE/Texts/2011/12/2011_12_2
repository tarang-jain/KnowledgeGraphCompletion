Analysis   
The tailwheel-equipped experimental amateur-built airplane was departing from a turf runway 
at night. The pilot reported that he observed two deer crossing the runway and swerved to 
avoid them. At that time, a flashlight fell from the top of the instrument panel to the floor of the 
cockpit. The pilot looked down to retrieve the flashlight and did not realize that the airplane 
had veered off the runway. He subsequently noticed that the airplane did not feel right, looked 
up, and observed that the airplane was approaching the tree line. The pilot reduced the engine 
power to idle and applied brakes; however, the airplane struck trees, which resulted in 
substantial damage to the left wing. The pilot stated that he did not experience any mechanical 
malfunctions with the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot did not maintain directional control during takeoff at night due to his distraction with 
a dropped flashlight, and he delayed his decision to abort the takeoff.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
