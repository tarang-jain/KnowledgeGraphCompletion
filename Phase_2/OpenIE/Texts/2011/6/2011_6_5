Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Fullerton, CA
Accident Number:
WPR11LA363
Date & Time:
06/01/2011, 1640 PDT 
Registration:
N340BG
Aircraft:
CESSNA 340A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that, at the conclusion of a flight, he made a normal landing and 
commenced a turn off the runway. While negotiating the turn toward a taxiway, the left brake 
ceased to properly function, and the airplane rolled into the soft dirt terrain adjacent to the 
taxiway. The subsequent examination of the airplane revealed that a weld had fractured in 
fatigue in the left engine's oil return line, which was located near the left main landing gear 
wheel assembly. The wheel and brake assembly were covered in oil. The oil significantly 
inhibited the brake's functionality and effectively reduced the braking capability to zero, which 
resulted in the pilot's loss of directional control.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inability to maintain directional control during landing due to the left brake's 
degraded performance due to oil contamination, which resulted from the fatigue failure of an 
oil line component.
Findings
Aircraft
Brake - Damaged/degraded (Cause)
Directional control - Attain/maintain not possible
Eng oil sys (airframe furnish) - Fatigue/wear/corrosion (Cause)

Factual Information
On June 1, 2011, about 1640 Pacific daylight time, a Cessna 340A, N340BG, was substantially 
damaged when its nose gear collapsed and deformed primary airframe structure in the wheel 
well. The event occurred when the pilot lost directional control as he taxied off runway 24 
following an uneventful landing at the Fullerton Municipal Airport (FUL), Fullerton, 
California. Neither the airline transport certificated pilot nor passenger was injured. The 
airplane was registered to and operated by Humanitarian Airlift International, Coto de Caza, 
California. The personal flight was performed under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. 
The airplane departed Riverside, California, about 1545. 
According to the pilot, following completion of maintenance he took off to reposition the 
airplane. No evidence of mechanical anomalies were noted, and his landing at FUL was 
normal. Near the completion of the landing rollout, with normal and effective breaking, the 
pilot initiated a turn off the runway. During this event, the left brake system failed, and the 
airplane veered into soft dirt adjacent to the runway. The nose wheel dug into the dirt and 
collapsed. 
During the airplane's subsequent examination by an airframe and powerplant mechanic, a 
broken weld was found in the left engine's oil return line. The weld was located adjacent to the 
line's outlet nipple at the rear engine case. The line was routed to the case from the vacuum 
pump air-oil separator. Leaking oil from this broken weld had coated the rear engine case and 
left main landing gear brake assembly. According to the mechanic, engine oil on the left gear 
and wheel/ brake assembly caused braking action on the left brake to be reduced to zero. The 
weld break appeared related to fatigue.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
