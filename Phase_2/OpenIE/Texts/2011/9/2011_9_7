Analysis   
The pilot stated that the wind for takeoff was light and variable. After a few minutes of flying, 
he attempted two landings, both of which resulted in his performing a go-around. He said the 
third attempt appeared to be lined up well, but as he approached touchdown the wind became 
turbulent due to the buildings on the side of the runway. After touchdown, he lost directional 
control of the weight-shift controlled aircraft and it veered right, impacting a hangar. The 
aircraft™s keel beam was bent during the accident sequence.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s failure to maintain directional control during landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
