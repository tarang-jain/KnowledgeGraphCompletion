BELLANCA 8GCBC
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Aerodynamic stall/spin
Injuries:
1 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Banner Tow
Analysis 
After the airplane™s fourth unsuccessful attempt to pick up a banner, a witness reported that 
the airplane was flying about 100 feet above ground level and the wings were "wobbling." The 
airplane then descended, and spun before it impacted the ground. The pilot stated that he did 
not have any recollection of the accident or the events prior to the accident. No preimpact 
anomalies were noted with the airframe or engine during a postaccident examination.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s failure to maintain adequate airspeed while maneuvering near the ground, which 
resulted in an aerodynamic stall.
Findings
Aircraft
Airspeed - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Incorrect action performance - Pilot (Cause)

Factual Information
On August 2, 2011, at 1500, eastern daylight time, a Bellanca 8GCBC, N87020, registered to an 
individual and operated by Heads Up Advertising, incurred substantial damage when it 
impacted terrain in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey. The pilot was seriously injured. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed and a company flight plan was filed for the Title 14 Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 91, banner towing flight. The flight originated from Woodbine 
Municipal Airport (OBI), Woodbine, New Jersey, about 1450.
The responding Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector stated that the pilot fueled 
the airplane prior to flying towards the banner pick up area. The pilot attempted 3 banner 
pickups prior to the accident. He maneuvered the airplane for the fourth attempt but failed to 
pick up the banner. The banner ground handler looked away and started to prepare the banner 
for another attempt, when moments later he heard a loud impact noise and observed the 
airplane had crashed into the ground about half mile away from the pickup area, on the 
crosswind for the banner tow pattern. 
According to a witness, the airplane was observed flying approximately 100 feet above ground 
level. She noted that the wings were "wobbling" and the airplane was not climbing although it 
was in a nose up attitude. Next, she saw the airplane begin to "nosedive" and start spinning but 
was unable to see the airplane impact the ground. 
The pilot stated that he did not have any recollection of the accident or the events prior to the 
accident.  
The airplane was manufactured in 1974 and was equipped with a Lycoming O-360 series, 180-
horsepower engine. The airplane's most recent annual inspection was completed on February 
3, 2011. At the time of the inspection, the reported aircraft time was 6698.0 total hours and the 
recorded tachometer was 2090.15 hours. The tachometer located in the wreckage 2236.91 
hours. 
The pilot, age 20, held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine 
land and instrument airplane. His most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) second-
class medical certificate was issued in May 2011. He reported 600 total hours of flight 
experience, of which, 65 hours were in the accident airplane make and model.
A post accident examination of the wreckage by the FAA revealed that control continuity was 
verified to all flight control surfaces. Fuel samples were taken from each wing with no water or 
contaminants noted. Examination of the engine was performed and the top and bottom 
sparkplugs were removed and no issues were noted. The crankshaft was rotated by the 
propeller flange and compression was observed on all cylinders. In addition, spark was 
obtained from the spark plug leads during the rotation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
