Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Rawlings, WY
Accident Number:
WPR11CA365
Date & Time:
08/01/2011, 1545 MDT 
Registration:
N7024V
Aircraft:
CESSNA 162
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that prior to takeoff, he noted an approaching storm but estimated that the 
wind was light and variable for the takeoff roll. The airplane was slow to accelerate and reached 
the 50 knot rotation speed halfway down the runway. The pilot stated that the airplane lifted 
off and maintained an altitude a few feet above the runway, but lost altitude at the end. The 
airplane struck the ground and subsequently nosed over, coming to rest inverted. A few 
minutes after the accident, the pilot reported that it began to rain. The airport density altitude 
at the time of the accident was calculated to be approximately 9,000 feet, which is 1,000 feet 
above the manufacturer's recommended maximum takeoff altitude as outlined in the Pilot's 
Operating Handbook. The weather observation facility located on the field reported that 3 
minutes before the accident the wind was a left quartering tailwind at 5 knots, while shortly 
after the accident the wind was a left quartering tailwind at 22 knots, gusting to 32 knots with 
respect to the airplane's takeoff runway direction. The pilot reported that there were no 
preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airframe or engine that would have 
precluded normal flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's decision to attempt a takeoff at a density altitude that was outside the performance 
envelope of the airplane. Also causal was the flight's likely encounter with a sudden tailwind 
gust.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
