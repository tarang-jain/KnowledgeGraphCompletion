Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
New Columbia, IL
Accident Number:
CEN11LA317
Date & Time:
05/03/2011, 1830 CDT 
Registration:
N38096
Aircraft:
Texas Helicopter Corporation OH-
13E/M74
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Collision during takeoff/land
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis 
The aerial-application helicopter was operating from an uncultivated area of the wheat field 
being sprayed. The pilot stated that, shortly after takeoff, while accelerating through 
translational lift, the helicopter encountered a momentary loss of lift, consistent with an 
encounter with a wind gust, and settled into the wheat crop. The helicopter pitched down 
suddenly as the spray booms made contact with the crop and subsequently collided with 
terrain. The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures 
that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate clearance from the wheat crop during takeoff.
Findings
Aircraft
Altitude - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Terrain - Contributed to outcome

Factual Information
On May 3, 2011, at 1830 central daylight time, a Texas Helicopter Corporation model OH-
13E/M74 helicopter, N38096, was substantially damaged when it collided with terrain during 
takeoff near New Columbia, Illinois. The pilot was not injured. The helicopter was registered to 
and operated by Hendrickson Flying Service Incorporated, under the provisions of 14 Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 137. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, 
which was operated without a flight plan. The local aerial-application flight was originating at 
the time of the accident.
The pilot reported that the helicopter was operating from an uncultivated area of the wheat 
field being sprayed. The helicopter had been refueled and loaded with fungicide immediately 
before the accident takeoff. The pilot stated that shortly after takeoff, while accelerating 
through translational lift, the helicopter encountered a momentary loss of lift consistent with a 
wind gust and settled into the wheat crop. The helicopter pitched down suddenly as the spray 
booms made contact with the crop, and subsequently collided with terrain. The helicopter 
came to rest on its right side about 75 yards from the takeoff position. The engine continued to 
run after impact and was subsequently turned-off by the pilot using the magneto switch. The 
helicopter sustained substantial damage to the main rotor system, fuselage, and tailboom. The 
pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would 
have precluded normal operation of the helicopter.
The nearest aviation weather observation station with recorded historical weather information 
was at Barkley Regional Airport (KPAH), about 19 nm south of the accident site, which was 
equipped with an automated surface observing system (ASOS).
At 1853, the KPAH ASOS reported the following weather conditions: Wind 320 degrees at 6 
knots; visibility 10 miles; sky clear; temperature 16 degrees Celsius; dew point 1 degrees 
Celsius; altimeter setting 30.22 inches of mercury.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
