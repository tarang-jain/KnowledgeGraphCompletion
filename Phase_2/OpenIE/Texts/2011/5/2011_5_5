Analysis   
The pilot arrived at his intended destination about 90 minutes prior to the beginning of civil 
twilight. He stated that he was cleared to land and subsequently landed off the runway and 
struck an airport sign, which caused substantial damage to the airplane. He added that 
requesting for the runway lights to be turned up, better familiarization with the airport, flying a 
longer approach, or executing a go-around might have prevented the accident. He stated that 
there were no failures or malfunctions related to the airplane prior to the accident. Federal 
Aviation Administration inspectors stated that the pilot had been cleared to land on runway 1L 
and misjudged the approach. They reported that the airplane touched down in the grass area 
between parallel taxiways A and B, near the crossing taxiway G.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's misjudgment of the landing area, which resulted in the airplane touching down on a 
grass area adjacent to the runway and between parallel taxiways.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
