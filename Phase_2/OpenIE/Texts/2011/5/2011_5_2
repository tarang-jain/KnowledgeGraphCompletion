Analysis   
According to the pilot, his original intent was to start, run-up, and then taxi his airplane on the 
day of the accident. At the completion of the run-up, the pilot taxied the airplane onto the 
active runway for a "fast taxi" and applied full engine power. The airplane achieved takeoff 
speed, the pilot pulled back on the control yoke, and the airplane lifted from the runway. The 
pilot then aborted the takeoff and lost directional control as the airplane touched down on the 
runway. The airplane impacted a fence, resulting in substantial damage to the wings. The pilot 
reported that there were no mechanical deficiencies with the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the aborted takeoff.
Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
