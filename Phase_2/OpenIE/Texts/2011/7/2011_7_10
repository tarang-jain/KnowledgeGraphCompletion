Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Flight control sys malf/fail

1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that, during the takeoff roll, he was unable to correct an uncommanded left 
yaw with control inputs, so he elected to abort the takeoff. During rollout, the airplane 
departed the left side of the runway and the landing gear collapsed, which resulted in 
substantial damage to the right wing spar. A postaccident examination revealed that a 
"nicopress" fitting on the left rudder cable had failed and disconnected from its bell-crank. The 
cable fitting had been pressed with an improper tool or technique at installation. The airplane's 
entire flight control system had been refitted and re-rigged approximately 9 years prior to the 
accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The improper installation of the right rudder control cable by maintenance personnel, which 
resulted in the pilot's inability to maintain directional control during takeoff.
Findings
Aircraft
Rudder control system - Incorrect service/maintenance (Cause)
Directional control - Attain/maintain not possible (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
