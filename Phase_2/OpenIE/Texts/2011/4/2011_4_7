Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Vega Baja, PR
Accident Number:
ERA11LA230
Date & Time:
04/01/2011, 1635 AST 
Registration:
N98FR
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172P
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (partial)
Injuries:
3 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
During cruise flight, about 1,000 feet above ground level, the engine lost power and began to 
vibrate. The pilot was unable to maintain altitude, so he performed a forced landing to a nearby 
abandoned military airfield. After touchdown, the airplane departed the end of the runway and 
collided with trees and bushes resulting in substantial damage to the airframe. A postaccident 
examination of the engine revealed that the No. 2 cylinder exhaust valve failed, and the valve 
parts exited the engine through the exhaust system. The operator reported that the exhaust 
valve had accumulated about 1,120 hours since installation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the No. 2 cylinder exhaust valve resulting in a loss of engine power.

Factual Information
On April 1, 2011, about 1635 Atlantic Standard Time, a Cessna 172P, N98FR, experienced a loss 
of engine power and force landed on a closed, abandoned airfield near Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. 
The airplane was substantially damaged. The airplane was registered to Flight World, Inc. and 
was operated by Isla Grande Flying School under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no 
flight plan was filed. The private pilot and two passengers were not injured. The flight 
originated from Borinquen, Puerto Rico (BQN) about 1600 and was destined for San Juan, 
Puerto Rico (SIG).
The pilot reported that the airplane was in cruise at 1,000 feet above ground level when the 
engine lost power and began to vibrate heavily and the altitude could not be maintained. About 
250 feet, he observed a runway at a closed, former military base and attempted a landing. 
During the landing attempt, the airplane collided with trees and bushes. Structural damage to 
the wings and fuselage resulted.
Initial examination of the engine by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that 
the number 2 cylinder exhaust valve spring was loose. The cylinder was subsequently examined 
and the exhaust valve, manufactured by Superior Air Parts, was found to have failed. The 
operator reported that all of the exhaust valve parts, with the exception of the valve keepers 
and associated parts, exited the exhaust system. The exhaust valve reportedly had accumulated 
about 1,120 hours since installation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
