Factual Information
On May 2, 2001, at 1030 eastern daylight time, a Cessna C182P, N1491S, flipped over during a 
crosswind landing on the grass strip at Chalet Suzanne Air Strip, Lake Wales, Florida. The 
personal flight was conducted by the pilot under  provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 91 with an 
instrument  flight plan filed. Visual weather conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. 
The airplane was substantially damaged. The airline transport  pilot and his three passengers 
were not injured. The flight departed Ocala Regional Airport, in Ocala, Florida, at 1000.
According to the pilot, during a crosswind landing on runway 36 at Chalet Suzanne Air Strip, 
"while making a normal approach, right after the nose lowered to the ground, the nose either 
hit a rock or hole. The  nose pitched up and down repeatedly. The nose of the plane dug into 
the turf and the airplane flipped on its back". The airplane came to rest inverted. The pilot 
stated that the runway was rough and uneven terrain. The pilot and passengers then exited the 
airplane.
The pilot did not report a mechanical problem with the airplane. Examination of the airplane  
failed to disclose any mechanical malfunction or component failure. A review of recorded 
weather data disclosed that, weather conditions at the time of the accident showed winds 090 
at 14 knots. According to The Pilot Operating Handbook, the maximum demonstrated 
crosswind is 15 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
