Denton, TX
Accident Number:
FTW02LA029
Date & Time:
11/03/2001, 1500 CST 
Registration:
N96LS
Aircraft:
Landoll Vans RV 3-A
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot had spent most of the day waxing his airplane and decided to fly it once around the 
pattern.  The engine start-up, taxi, and engine run-up "indications were normal."  While 
climbing out at 600 feet agl, the engine lost power.  The pilot attempted, unsuccessfully, to 
restart the engine.  During a forced landing to a field, the airplane impacted small trees and 
vegetation.  Examination of the engine revealed it was "seized" and contained no oil.  No 
evidence of an oil leak was found.  The mechanic, who had been servicing the airplane, 
reported to the FAA inspector that he had drained the oil from the airplane's engine, left the 
airplane unattended, and had not replenished the oil prior to the accident flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to perform a preflight inspection, which resulted in a loss of total engine 
power due to oil starvation.  A  contributing factor was the lack of suitable training for the 
forced landing.

Factual Information
On November 3, 2001, approximately 1500 central standard time, a Landoll Vans RV 3-A 
single-engine homebuilt experimental airplane, N96LS, was substantially damaged when it 
struck trees and terrain during a forced landing following a loss of engine power during takeoff 
from the Denton Municipal Airport, Denton, Texas.  The airplane was owned by N96LS Club 
LTD of Wilmington, Delaware.  The commercial pilot, operator and sole occupant of the 
airplane, was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a flight plan was not 
filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.  The local flight was 
originating at the time of the accident.
The pilot reported in the Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report (NTSB Form 6120.1/2) that 
he had spent most of the day waxing his airplane and decided to fly it once around the pattern.  
The engine start-up, taxi, and engine run-up "indications were normal."  During climb out after 
takeoff from runway 17, he had turned crosswind and had climbed to 600 feet when the engine 
lost power.  The pilot turned downwind, switched fuel tanks, and attempted, unsuccessfully, to 
restart the engine.  The pilot determined that he could not make it back to the runway and 
initiated a forced landing, without flaps, to a field.  During the approach, the airplane impacted 
small trees and vegetation.  Subsequently, the airplane impacted the ground and came to rest 
upright.
An examination of the airplane, by the FAA inspector who responded to the accident site, 
revealed that both wing fuel tanks were full of fuel.  Both the left and right wings sustained 
substantial damage, and the left main landing gear was found separated.  The engine was 
found "seized," and it contained no oil.  No evidence of an oil leak was found.
The mechanic, who had been servicing the airplane, reported to the FAA inspector that he had 
drained the oil from the airplane's engine, left the airplane unattended, and had not 
replenished the oil before the accident flight.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
