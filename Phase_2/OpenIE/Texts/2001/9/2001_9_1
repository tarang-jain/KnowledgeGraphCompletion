Analysis 
The private certificated pilot was departing a remote lake in a float-equipped airplane.  The 
lake is about 1,500 feet long, and is a location the pilot has operated from in the past.  The pilot 
said he taxied into the middle of the lake several times to check the wind conditions before 
takeoff.  The wind appeared to shift from the northwest, to the west, about 12 knots.  The pilot 
said he initiated one takeoff run, but aborted the takeoff.  His second takeoff included a step 
turn toward the south, during which the airplane seemed to lose a slight amount of speed.  The 
pilot decided to lower the flaps to assist in getting off the water and he reached for the flap 
handle.  The pilot said that as he reached for the handle, he realized he was reaching for the 
area of the airplane where the flap handle is normally installed in his other airplane, a Piper 
PA-18.  He was distracted by not finding the flap handle in the accident airplane. The airplane 
became airborne, but collided with the bank of the lake.  The airplane was then launched 
upward in a steep nose-up attitude, and the pilot said a stall was eminent.  He lowered the nose 
of the airplane, but the airplane rolled to the left, and collided with the ground.  The left float 
assembly, the left wing, and fuselage were damaged.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's delay in aborting the takeoff.  A factor in the accident was the pilot's diverted 
attention during the takeoff.

Factual Information
On September 1, 2001, about 1530 Alaska daylight time, a float-equipped Maule M-7-235B 
airplane, N1007U, sustained substantial damage during takeoff from a remote lake, about 25 
miles northeast of Koliganek, Alaska.  The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules 
(VFR) cross-country personal flight when the accident occurred.  The airplane was operated by 
the pilot.  The private certificated pilot, and the sole passenger, were not injured.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed.
During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
investigator-in-charge (IIC) on September 4, the pilot reported that he was departing Frost 
Lake, which is about 1,500 feet long, and is a location the pilot has operated from in the past.  
The pilot said he taxied into the middle of the lake several times to check the wind conditions 
before takeoff.  The wind appeared to shift from the northwest, to the west, about 12 knots.  
The pilot said he initiated one takeoff run, but aborted the takeoff.  His second takeoff included 
a step turn toward the south, during which the airplane seemed to lose a slight amount of 
speed.  The pilot decided to lower the flaps to assist in getting off the water and he reached for 
the flap handle.  The pilot said that as he reached for the handle, he realized he was reaching 
for the area of the airplane where the flap handle is normally installed in his other airplane, a 
Piper PA-18.  He was distracted by not finding the flap handle in the accident airplane.  The 
airplane became airborne, but collided with the bank of the lake.  The airplane was then 
launched upward in a steep nose-up attitude, and the pilot said a stall was eminent.  He 
lowered the nose of the airplane, but the airplane rolled to the left, and collided with the 
ground.  The left float assembly, the left wing, and fuselage were damaged.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
