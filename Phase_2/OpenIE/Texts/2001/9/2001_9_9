Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Kemmerer, WY
Accident Number:
DEN01LA154
Date & Time:
09/02/2001, 1150 MDT 
Registration:
N440TJ
Aircraft:
McDonnell Douglas 369E
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 133: Rotorcraft Ext. Load
Analysis 
The pilot was transporting bags of seismic equipment by long line to a remote site. While he 
hovered into the wind waiting for a flagger, the helicopter was struck by a wind gust and 
started turning right. The pilot applied left pedal, but was unable to stop the rotation. The 
helicopter struck terrain, breaking off both skid legs, tail rotor blades, and tail rotor gearbox. 
FAA's Advisory Circular 90-95 defines the loss of tail rotor effectiveness as "a critical, low-
speed aerodynamic flight characteristic that can result in an uncommanded rapid yaw rate 
which does not subside of its own accord and, if not corrected, can result in the loss of aircraft 
control." Some of the conditions conducive to LTE include (1) a high power setting, (2) low 
airspeed, and (3) a tailwind or left crosswind.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
loss of tail rotor effectiveness while hovering. A contributing factor was the wind gust.
Findings
Occurrence #1: LOSS OF CONTROL - IN FLIGHT
Phase of Operation: HOVER
Findings
1. (C) LOSS OF TAIL ROTOR EFFECTIVENESS - ENCOUNTERED - PILOT IN COMMAND
2. (F) WEATHER CONDITION - GUSTS
----------
Occurrence #2: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER
Phase of Operation: DESCENT - UNCONTROLLED

Factual Information
On September 2, 2001, approximately 1150 mountain daylight time, a McDonnell Douglas 
369E helicopter, N440TJ, operated by Omni Aviation of Carencro, Louisiana, was substantially 
damaged when it collided with terrain while hovering near Kemmerer, Wyoming. The 
commercial pilot, the sole occupant aboard, was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed for this work use flight being conducted under Title 
14 CFR Part 133. The helicopter departed a nearby landing zone approximately 1145.
According to the pilot, he was transporting bags of seismic equipment by long line to a remote 
site. He said while he hovered into the wind and waited for a flagger, "a [wind] gust caused the 
helicopter to start to turn right." He applied "more left pedal," but was unable to stop the 
rotation. He jettisoned the external load, lowered the collective control, and attempted to fly 
out of the condition. He was able to stop most of the rotation but not before the helicopter 
struck the terrain. Both skid legs, tail rotor blades, and tail rotor gearbox broke off. The left 
horizontal stabilizer was struck by one of the blades, and the tail boom buckled when it struck 
the ground. The pilot said the winds were "generally light and variable, with [an] occasional 
gust."
According to FAA's Advisory Circular (AC) 90-95, loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) "is a 
critical, low-speed aerodynamic flight characteristic that can result in an uncommanded rapid 
yaw rate which does not subside of its own accord and, if not corrected, can result in the loss of 
aircraft control. Some of the conditions conducive to LTE include (1) a high power setting, (2) 
low airspeed, and (3) a tailwind or left crosswind

investigations. Dockets released prior to June 1, 2009 are publicly available from the NTSB™s

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
