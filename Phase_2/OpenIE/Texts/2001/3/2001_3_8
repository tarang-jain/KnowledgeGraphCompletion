Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Logan, UT
Accident Number:
DEN01LA061
Date & Time:
03/03/2001, 1245 MST 
Registration:
N152RC
Aircraft:
Cessna 152
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
This was the student pilot's first solo flight. The first two landings on runway 35 had been 
accomplished without incident. The approach for a third landing had to be abandoned because 
there was an airplane still on the runway. The next approach resulted in a normal landing but 
during the rollout, the airplane raised up on its left main landing wheel. "I couldn't control the 
plane," the pilot wrote. The airplane veered "very hard" to the left into a snow bank. Winds 
recorded 6 minutes after the accident were from 240 degrees at 6 knots. This would present 
the pilot with slightly less than a 6 knot left crosswind component and a 2 knot tailwind 
component.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during landing.

Factual Information
On March 3, 2001, approximately 1245 mountain standard time, N152RC, a Cessna 152, owned 
and operated by Utah State University, was substantially damaged when it collided with terrain 
during landing on runway 30 at Logan-Cache Airport, Logan, Utah. The student pilot, the only 
occupant aboard, was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight 
plan had been filed for the instructional flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91. The 
flight originated at Logan at 1230.
This was the student pilot's first solo flight. He said that the first two landings had been 
accomplished without incident. His approach for the third landing was abandoned because 
there was an airplane still on the runway. The next approach resulted in a normal landing but 
during the rollout, the airplane raised up on its left main landing wheel. "I couldn't control the 
plane," the pilot wrote. The airplane veered "very hard" to the left into a snow bank.
Winds recorded 6 minutes after the accident were from 240 degrees at 6 knots. This would 
present the pilot with slightly less than a 6 knot LEFT crosswind component and a 2 knot 
tailwind component.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
