Factual Information
On June 2, 2001, at 1400 eastern daylight time, a Cessna R172-K, N1278V, registered to and 
operated by the private pilot, experienced a hard  landing at Benjamin Rivera Noriega Airport, 
Culebras Island, Puerto Rico. The personal flight was operated  under the provisions of Title 14 
CFR Part 91 and visual flight rules. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight 
plan was filed. The airplane sustained substantial damage, and the pilot and passenger 
reported no injuries. The flight departed Culebras Island, Puerto Rico, at 1340.
According to the pilot,  he was on approach to Flamenco Beach when he encountered a 
downdraft approximately 15 feet over the runway. He stated," that the downdraft pushed the 
airplane down hard onto the runway." After the hard landing he inspected the airplane and 
found no visible damage to the landing gear, wheel pants or fairings. Weather data did not 
reveal any gust or downdrafts in the area at the time of the accident. 
Examination of the airplane revealed that the lower part of the engine firewall was buckled, 
with buckling of the skin under the fuselage behind the firewall. A review of the FAA form 337 
repair, showed that the lower firewall assembly,  stringer assembly and the lower engine mount 
on the left hand side had been replaced. There were no mechanical problems reported by the 
pilot prior to the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
