Analysis 
THE PILOT WAS PRACTICING AIRWORK DURING A SOLO TRAINING FLT, WHEN A 
PARTIAL LOSS OF POWER OCCURRED. HE APPLIED CARB HEAT AND POWER WAS 
TEMPORARILY RESTORED BEFORE IT DECREASED AGAIN. UNABLE TO MAINTAIN

FIRST AND THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER. DURING TESTS, THE CARB HEAT OPERATED 
NORMALLY. TEMP AND DEW POINT AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WERE 31 DEGS F 
AND 22 DEGS F, RESPECTIVELY. ACCORDING TO CARB ICE PROBABILITY CHARTS, 
THIS CONDITION WAS CONDUCIVE TO CARB ICE DURING GLIDE POWER SETTINGS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
