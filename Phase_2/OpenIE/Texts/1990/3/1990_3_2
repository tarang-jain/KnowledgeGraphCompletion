Analysis 
THE ACFT WAS EQUIPPED WITH A TEMPORARY FUEL SYS TO FERRY IT TO SOUTH 
AFRICA.  ALSO, IT WAS APPROVED FOR SPECIAL FLT OPNS & A MAXIMUM GROSS WT 
LIMITATION OF 4235 LBS.  ITS ACTUAL WEIGHT FOR TAKEOFF WAS CALCULATED TO 
BE 3956 LBS.  THE PLT TOOK OFF ON RWY 16 FOR THE INITIAL FLT WITH THE WIND 
FROM ABOUT 240 DEG AT 17 KTS.  SHORTLY AFTER LIFT-OFF, THE ACFT WAS 
OBSERVED FLYING JUST ABOVE THE TREES IN A NOSE HI ATTITUDE. THE PLT 
TURNED THE ACFT ABOUT 90 DEG TO THE LEFT TOWARD A RIVER (DOWN SLOPE).  
HE THEN TURNED IT FURTHER LEFT & ALIGNED ITS FLT PATH WITH THE RIVER.  
HOWEVER, THE ACFT HIT A POLE ON A BOAT DOCK & CRASHED IN THE RIVER.  NO 
PREIMPACT PART FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OF THE ACFT WAS FOUND DURING 
THE INVESTIGATION.  ONE WITNESS, WHO SAW THE ACFT AFTER TAKEOFF, SAID IT 
WAS MUSHING AS THE LNDG GEAR WAS BEING RETRACTED, THEN THE PLT 'MADE A 
STEEP BANK TO THE LEFT & WENT BELOW THE TREES.' 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
PREMATURE LIFT-OFF BY THE PILOT, WHILE TAKING OFF WITH A HEAVY GROSS 
WEIGHT IN UNFAVORABLE WINDS, AND THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO ATTAIN/MAINTAIN 
ADEQUATE AIRSPEED, WHICH RESULTED IN AN INADVERTENT STALL/MUSH.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
