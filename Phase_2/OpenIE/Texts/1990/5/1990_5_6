Analysis 
THE AG PILOT WAS SPREADING SEED RICE ON THE FIELD, AND DURING THE SECOND 
PASS, THE ENGINE STOPPED, THEN RESUMED POWER. THIS OCCURRED 2 MORE

FORWARD TO THE INVERTED POSITION. THE AIRPLANE WAS DEMOLISHED, BUT THE 
COMMERCIAL PILOT WAS NOT INJURED. AFTER RECOVERY, THE NUMBER FOUR

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
