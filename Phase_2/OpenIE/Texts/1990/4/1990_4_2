Analysis 
DURING THE INITIAL CLIMB AFTER TAKE OFF THE ENGINE BEGAN TO RUN 
ROUGHLY & THEN QUIT. A HARD LANDING WAS MADE IN A CLEARING ADJACENT TO 
THE RUNWAY WHEN THE PILOT INTENTIONALLY STALLED THE AIRPLANE & 
ALLOWED IT TO MUSH INTO THE GROUND. THE AIRPLANE WAS FUELED WITH A 
MIXTURE OF 100LL & AUTOMOTIVE, ACCORDING TO THE PILOT. HE ALSO STATED 
THAT THE CARBURETOR HEAT CHECKED NORMALLY BEFORE TAKE OFF. THE 
CARBURETOR HEAT WAS LEFT IN THE ON POSITION WHILE THE AIRPLANE  WAS 
POSITIONED FOR TAKE OFF ON THE RUNWAY. THE AUTOMOTIVE FUEL STC 
INDICATES THAT CARBURETOR ICE WILL FORM EARLIER WITH AUTO FUEL, UNDER 
CONDUCIVE ATOMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS. CARBURETOR ICING CONDITIONS 
EXISTED AT THE TIME OF THE TAKE OFF. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
LOSS OF ENGINE POWER BECAUSE OF CARBURETOR ICING CONDITIONS. A FACTOR 
IN THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT'S IMPROPER USE OF CARBURETOR HEAT.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
