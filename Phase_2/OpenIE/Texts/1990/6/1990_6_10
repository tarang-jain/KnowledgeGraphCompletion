Analysis 
THE PILOT STATED THAT, WHILE IN CRUISE FLIGHT IN IFR CONDITIONS AND 
MODERATE RAIN, THE AIRCRAFT EXPERIENCED A COMPLETE LOSS OF ENGINE 
POWER. ATTEMPTS TO RESTART THE ENGINE WERE UNSUCESSFUL, AND A FORCED 
LANDING WAS PERFORMED. THE AIRCRAFT TRAVELED OVER A SLIGHT 
EMBANKMENT, THE NOSE WHEEL DUG INTO THE GROUND AND THE AIRCRAFT 
NOSED OVER. POST-ACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE, ITS ACCESSORIES, 
AND THE FUEL SYSTEM REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF PRE-IMPACT MECHANICAL 
MALFUNCTION. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S ENCOUNTER WITH UNSUITABLE TERRAIN DURING THE LANDING ROLL 
AFTER A FORCED LANDING. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS IN THIS ACCIDENT WERE THE 
TOTAL POWERPLANT FAILURE AND THE IFR WEATHER CONDITIONS WHICH 
LIMITED THE LANDING SITE SELECTION.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
