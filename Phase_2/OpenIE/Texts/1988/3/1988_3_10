Analysis 
THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR WAS GIVING DUAL INSTRUCTION TO A STUDENT PILOT ON 
NIGHT LANDINGS. ON THE SIXTH TOUCH-AND-GO LANDING, THE INSTRUCTOR 
TURNED THE LANDING LIGHT OFF FOR A NO-LIGHT LANDING. THE STUDENT 
LANDED THE AIRCRAFT TO THE RIGHT OF CENTERLINE, AND BEFORE A 
CORRECTION COULD BE MADE TOWARDS THE CENTER OF THE RUNWAY, THE 
AIRPLANE STRUCK DEEP, UNPLOWED SNOW ABOUT FOUR FEET INSIDE THE 
RUNWAY PERIMETER LIGHTS AND NOSED-DOWN. THE INSTRUCTOR AND STUDENT 
WERE BOTH UNAWARE THAT THE RUNWAY HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETELY PLOWED. 
AN OFFICIAL FLIGHT PUBLICATION LISTS THE AIRPORT AS UNATTENDED AND 
UNMONITORED, AND RECOMMENDS A VISUAL INSPECTION PRIOR TO LANDING. THE 
INSTRUCTOR RECOMMENDED THAT NO-LIGHT LANDINGS SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED 
ONLY UNDER IDEAL RUNWAY/WEATHER CONDITIONS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
