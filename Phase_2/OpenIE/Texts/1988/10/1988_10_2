Analysis 
THE PLT REPORTED THAT THE LEFT BRAKE FAILED TO FUNCTION DURING TAXI 
WHEN HE ATTEMPTED TO REDUCE SPEED AND TURN 180 DEG INTO T/O POSITION. 
THE AIRPLANE BEGAN TO TRACK TO THE RIGHT. HE RELEASED BRAKE PRESSURE ON 
BOTH PEDALS THINKING THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE 
RUDDER PEDAL INSTEAD OF THE BRAKE PEDAL. HE THEN REAPPLIED PRESSURE 
AND EXPERIENCED THE SAME RESULTS. AT THAT POINT, HE REDUCED THE POWER 
TO IDLE. THE AIRPLANE RAN OFF THE SIDE OF THE RWY. TRAVELED DOWN AN 
EMBANKMENT, AND FLIPPED OVER. EXAM OF THE ACFT REVEALED A HOLE IN THE 
LEFT BRAKE-SYSTEM PRESSURE LINE BEHIND THE CO-PLT BRAKE PEDALS. THE 
HOLE HAD RESULTED FROM CHAFING BETWEEN A MOUNTING CLAMP & THE LINE. 
THE LINE & CLAMP WERE PROPERLY INSTALLED. THE HOLE WAS NOT VISIBLE UNTIL 
THE CLAMP WAS REMOVED. CORROSION WAS ALSO NOTED ON THE LINE IN THE 
AREA OF THE HOLE. A SEARCH OF FAA SDR'S REVEALED NO REPORTS OF SIMILAR 
FAILURES.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
