Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE PLT REPORTED THAT THE ENGINE LOST PWR ABOUT 20 MILES FROM THE ARPT 
WHERE HE HAD INTENDED TO REFUEL. THE AIRPLANE SUBSEQUENTLY COLLIDED 
WITH UTILITY WIRES AS HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO LAND ON A HWY. THE PLT 
ATTRIBUTED THE PWR LOSS TO FUEL EXHAUSTION. POSTCRASH EXAM OF THE 
AIRPLANE BY A MECH REVEALED ONLY TRACE AMOUNTS OF FUEL REMAINING ON 
BOARD. THE PLT NOTED THAT HE HAD TOPPED OFF THE FUEL TANKS PRIOR TO 
DEPARTURE; THIS SHOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM 5.5 TO 6 HRS OF ENDURANCE, BASED 
ON PREVIOUS FLIGHTS IN THE AIRPLANE. THE ACTUAL ENDURANCE WAS ABOUT 4.8 
HRS. EXAM OF THE AIRPLANE POH REVEALED THAT THE AIRPLANE HAD AN 
EXPECTED ENDURANCE OF ABOUT 4.7 HRS AT 75% PWR AND 5.4 HRS AT 65% PWR, 
WITH A 45 MIN RESERVE AT 45% PWR, UNDER THE FLT CONDITIONS REPORTED BY 
THE PLT. THE POH NOTES HOWEVER, THAT THERE ARE INDETERMINATE 
VARIABLES WHICH CAN ACCOUNT FOR VARIATIONS OF 10% OR MORE IN AIRPLANE 
RANGE & ENDURANCE. SEVERAL ARPTS WITH FUEL WERE AVAILABLE ALONG THE 
ROUTE OF FLT.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
