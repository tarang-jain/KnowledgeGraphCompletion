Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE AIRPLANE WAS ON A NIGHT CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT WHEN ENGINE OIL 
STARTED TO APPEAR ON THE WINDOWS. THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO GET THE 
AIRPLANE TO AN AIRPORT BEFORE THE OIL PRESSURE WENT TO ZERO. AFTER LOSS 
OF OIL PRESSURE, THE ENGINE STARTED TO VIBRATE, AND THE PROPELLER 
SEPARATED FROM THE ENGINE. WITH NO FORWARD VISIBILITY AND VERY LITTLE 
SIDE VISIBILITY, THE PILOT MADE A FORCED LANDING ON A HIGHWAY SERVICE 
ROAD; HOWEVER, DURING THE LANDING ROLL, THE AIRPLANE IMPACTED 
HIGHWAY SIGNS AND REFLECTORS. THE PILOT SAID THERE WAS A FIRE ON THE 
HIGHWAY, BEHIND THE AIRPLANE, BUT IT NEVER REACHED THE AIRPLANE. A 
TEARDOWN OF THE ENGINE REVEALED A FAILURE OF THE CRANKSHAFT THAT WAS 
INITIATED BY A PRE-EXISTING FATIGUE CRACK. THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT 
OPENING OF THE FATIGUE CRACK LED TO GRADUAL LOSS OF LUBRICATING OIL, 
THEN SEPARATION OF THE PROPELLER.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
