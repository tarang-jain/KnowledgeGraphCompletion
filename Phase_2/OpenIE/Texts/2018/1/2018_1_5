Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Positioning
Analysis   
The pilot and two medical crewmembers were on a return flight to a hospital helipad. During 
the approach to the helipad, the crew heard a noise outside the helicopter. The medical 
crewmembers reported they felt a slight "shudder" on the helicopter but attributed it to the 
wind as they approached the helipad. The pilot heard the noise, but there was no effect on the 
controls or flight characteristics, so he continued the landing without further incident. After 
engine shutdown, the oncoming pilot noticed that the helicopter's tail rotor drive shaft cover 
was missing. The surrounding area near the helicopter's approach path was searched, and the 
missing cover was found.
An examination of the helicopter noted substantial damage to the tail rotor drive shaft.
The day before the accident, scheduled maintenance was performed on the helicopter's tail 
rotor pitch change mechanism, which required removal of the drive shaft cover. The cover was 
reinstalled, and no problems were reported during a subsequent preflight inspection.
It is likely that maintenance personnel did not properly secure the cover fasteners after the 
cover was reinstalled.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Maintenance personnel's failure to properly secure the tail rotor drive shaft cover, which 
resulted in the cover departing the helicopter in flight.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=96587
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
