Analysis   
The pilot reported that, while en route in mountainous terrain at night at 6,500 ft, he 
encountered turbulence and downdrafts, during which time, he "felt a couple of impacts on the 
left side." He continued to the destination airport, where he noticed the ELT was transmitting 
over the radio. During the landing, the left main landing gear collapsed. The pilot reported that 
he initially thought the airplane had struck a bird, but postaccident examination revealed that 
the left wing had impacted a tree. 
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain adequate altitude while flying over mountainous terrain in 
turbulent wind conditions at night, which resulted in a tree strike.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=97480
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
