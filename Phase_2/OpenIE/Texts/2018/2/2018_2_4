GAA18CA124
Date & Time:
02/03/2018, 1830 CST 
Registration:
N61024
Aircraft:
CESSNA 150
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that, en route, he noticed a drop in the engine's rpm. He noted that the fuel 
shutoff valve was open, and the gas gauges showed half full in the right tank and quarter full in 
the left tank. He added that the carburetor heat was off, the mixture was full rich, and then the 
engine quit running. During the third attempt to restart the engine, it briefly started and then 
quit again. Subsequently, during an off-airport landing in a field, the airplane nosed over.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the empennage and fuselage.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation. He added that he had filled the gas "to 
the top" (22.5 gallons) before departure and had flown for 3.7 hours. The 1969 Cessna 150 
owner's manual states that the airplane's maximum range was 4.1 hours with no reserve at 75% 
power at 7,000 ft. 
The pilot further reported in a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety 
Board investigator-in-charge that he did not consult the emergency checklist because it was 
placed in the glovebox. 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspectors drained the fuel tanks about 5 days after the 
accident and reported that there was no evidence of fuel leakage around the fuel caps or on the 
ground. They drained about 8 to 12 ounces from the left wing tank and about 3/4 of a gallon 
from the right wing tank. The FAA inspectors added that the engine showed proper continuity, 
and the magnetos were operational. The engine was not run due to a fractured intake manifold 
just above the carburetor base flange. The fracture damage to the intake manifold was 
consistent with impact damage.
Probable Cause and Findings
Page 2 of 4GAA18CA124
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper fuel planning, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel 
exhaustion and a subsequent off-airport landing and nose-over.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=96730
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
