04/01/2018, 1353 MST 
Registration:

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The flight instructor reported that he was conducting a lesson in takeoffs and landings and go-
around procedures with the student pilot at the controls. During one particular go-around, the 
student retracted the flaps too far and the instructor stressed the importance of using the 
proper flap settings. On the subsequent downwind, the tower advised a crosswind from the 
south gusting to 18 knots. During the approach, the airplane drifted left of the runway 
centerline, so he called for the student to execute a go-around. The student pilot applied full 
power and reduced flaps from 40° to 10° (25º is prescribed in the go-around procedure). When 
the flight instructor noticed that the airplane was not climbing and the student was not 
correcting the course, the flight instructor took the flight controls. The flight instructor 
attempted to recover, but the airplane was in a nose-high attitude and struck the ground. The 
airplane then lifted off the ground and flew slowly toward a sign; the instructor "pulled up to 
avoid the sign," but the airplane struck the sign, aerodynamically stalled, and impacted the 
ground to the right of the runway.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.
The flight instructor reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or 
malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The automated weather observation station located on the accident airport reported that, at the 
time of the accident, the wind was from 110° at 8 knots. The airplane was landing on runway 
7L.
The Federal Aviation Administration's Airplane Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-3B, contains a 
section titled "Go-Arounds (Rejected Landings)" which states:
After establishing the proper climb attitude and power settings, be concerned first with flaps 
and secondly with the landing gear (if retractable). When the decision is made to perform a go-
around, takeoff power is applied immediately and the pitch attitude changed so as to slow or 
stop the descent. After the descent has been stopped, the landing flaps are partially retracted or 
Page 2 of 5GAA18CA193
placed in the takeoff position as recommended by the manufacturer. Caution must be used in 
retracting the flaps. Depending on the airplane's altitude and airspeed, it is wise to retract the 
flaps intermittently in small increments to allow time for the airplane to accelerate 
progressively as they are being raised. A sudden and complete retraction of the flaps could 
cause a loss of lift resulting in the airplane settling into the ground.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's improper selection of the flap setting during a go-around, and the flight 
instructor's delayed remedial action, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.

Note:
This accident report documents the factual circumstances of this accident as described 
to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=96965
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
