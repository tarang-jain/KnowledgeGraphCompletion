Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On April 2, 2018, about 1709 eastern standard time, a Cessna 150 airplane, N5614E, registered 
to the pilot, was destroyed when it collided with a Cessna 525 business jet, N511AC, while 
taking off from runway 15 at the Marion Municipal Airport (MZZ), Marion, Indiana. The 
private pilot and passenger of the Cessna 150 sustained fatal injuries and the airline transport 
pilot and 4 passengers of the Cessna 525 were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed in the area. Both flights were being conducted under the provisions of Federal Code 
of Regulations Part 91. The Cessna 150 was departing on runway 15 at MZZ a local VFR 
personal flight and the Cessna 525 was landing on runway 22 after an IFR flight that originated 
from Jackson, Michigan.
Examination of the accident site showed that the Cessna 150 had struck the empennage of the 
Cessna 525 at the intersection of runways 15 and 22. Evidence at the intersection showed that 
the airplanes came together perpendicular to each other. The Cessna 150 then impacted the 
ground and a post-crash fire ensued. The Cessna 525 continued to roll out on runway 22. There 
were three witnesses to the accident, located in the airport lounge, within hearing distance of 
the UNICOM radio. Each witness reported seeing the Cessna 150 just airborne when it struck 
the empennage of the Cessna 525. Two of the witnesses stated that they heard the Cessna 150 
pilot on runway 15 UNICOM frequency. The surviving pilot of the Cessna 525 stated that he did 
not see the departing Cessna 150 while he was on a straight-in approach to runway 22, nor did 
he see the 150 during the landing roll. He stated that he did not recall making a radio call on 
UNICOM, but did utilize his on board Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) system while 
on approach. He stated that the TCAS did not show any traffic on the airport. Passengers 
aboard the Cessna 525 were interviewed and all reported that they did not see the Cessna 150 
on the approach or during the landing roll.
The reported weather at MZZ at the time of the accident was VFR with 4 miles of visibility due 
to haze. Also, at the departure and arrival ends of runway 15/33, there was a sign stating, 
"Traffic Using Runway 4/22 Cannot Be Seen, Monitor Unicom 122.7." At the departure and 
arrival ends of runway 4/22, there was a sign stating, "Traffic Using 15/33 cannot Be Seen, 
Monitor Unicom 122.7." The MKK airport does not have a control tower.
