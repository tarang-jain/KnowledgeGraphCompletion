Aviation Accident Preliminary Report
Location:
Lago Vista, TX
Accident Number:
CEN18LA250
Date & Time:
07/01/2018, 2010 CDT 
Registration:
N2469C
Aircraft:
Cessna 180
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On July 1, 2018, about 2010 central daylight time, a Cessna 180 single-engine airplane, 
N2469C, was substantially damaged while landing at Rusty Allen Airport (RYW), Lago Vista, 
Texas. The airline transport pilot and passenger were not injured. The airplane was registered 
to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of Title 14 
Code of Federal Regulations
 (
CFR
) 
Part 91. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight that departed 
Childress Municipal Airport (CDS), Childress, Texas, about 1740 with RYW as the intended 
destination.
According to the pilot, the surface wind was from 120° magnetic at 7 knots, gusting 17 knots, 
when he entered the traffic pattern for runway 15 at RYW. He noted that the wind direction 
became variable between 090° magnetic and 170° magnetic while the airplane was on the 
downwind leg. The pilot made a normal approach for three-point landing with a left crosswind 
correction; however, the airplane rolled left and landed hard on the left main landing gear 
during the landing flare. The pilot reported that the airplane bounced and that he was unable 
to regain roll control before the airplane landed hard again on the left main landing gear. The 
airplane bounced a second time and the left main landing gear leg fractured on the third 
contact with the runway. The airplane subsequently ground-looped to the left and came to rest 
heading about 180° from the original runway direction. The left main wing spar was 
substantially damaged when the left wingtip impacted the runway.
The left main landing gear leg was retained for a laboratory examination to determine if 
preexisting damage had contributed to its fracture during the accident.
