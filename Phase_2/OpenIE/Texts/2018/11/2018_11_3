Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
On November 2, 2018, about 1136 central daylight time, a Cessna T210N airplane, N81KD, 
impacted terrain near Bradley, South Dakota. The pilot was fatally injured, and the airplane 
was destroyed. The airplane was registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 
Title 14 
Code of Federal Regulations
 Part 91. Day instrument meteorological conditions 
prevailed for the personal flight, which departed about 1115 without a flight plan from Clark 
County Airport (8D7), Clark, South Dakota, with a destination of Sigurd Anderson Airport 
(1D7), Webster, South Dakota. 
According to air traffic control data, the pilot departed Sioux Falls Regional Airport (FSD), 
Sioux Falls, South Dakota, with a destination of his home airport at 1D7. Due to poor weather 
conditions at 1D7, the pilot diverted to 8D7 and landed there about 0940. 
At 1108, during taxi out at 8D7, the pilot phoned a friend to ask about weather conditions 
closer to 1D7. After his friend stated that low overcast clouds existed at his location, the pilot 
departed 8D7 and flew toward 1D7, about 40 miles away. 
A witness near the accident site, which was midway between 8D7 and 1D7, heard "an airplane 
that seemed to climb and descend twice, followed by a loud noise". The airplane impacted a 
farm area with a steep nose-down angle and a post-crash fire ensued.
