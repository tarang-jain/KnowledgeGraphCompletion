Location:
Camas, WA
Accident Number:
GAA18CA184
Date & Time:
03/04/2018, 1330 PST 
Registration:
N3756W
Aircraft:
PIPER PA32
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Fuel exhaustion
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that, before departure, he estimated that the right tip fuel tank was three-
quarters full (about 14 gallons), and each main fuel tank had about 20 gallons of fuel.
The pilot reported that, during cruise, he decided to use the right tip fuel tank, even though he 
was aware that the right tip fuel tank gauge was inoperative. He added that, after about 25-30 
minutes, he performed various stall maneuvers before returning to the departure airport to 
land. The pilot noticed a reduction in engine power and a drop in the manifold pressure and 
concluded that the airplane would not be able to return to the airport, so he continued a left 
turn toward a farm field. The pilot began to troubleshoot for carburetor ice to no avail. The 
airplane landed in the farm field and impacted a ditch.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine mounts.
The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
The pilot added that, during a postaccident examination, it was revealed that the right tip fuel 
tank was dry and "that the engine lost power due to fuel starvation."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate inflight fuel management and his failure to switch to a fuel tank with 
adequate fuel, which resulted in fuel starvation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
