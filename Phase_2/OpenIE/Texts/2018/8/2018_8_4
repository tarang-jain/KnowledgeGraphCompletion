On August 2, 2018, about 0930 mountain daylight time, a Bell 47G 3B helicopter, N347BH, 
experienced an engine power anomaly during attempted landing at Crazy Horse Heliport

normal operating range. The pilot increased throttle but was unable to recover RPMs within 
normal range and the helicopter descended toward the ground. The pilot executed a forced 
landing in a grassy area on the side of a highway. The helicopter rolled to the right after landing 
and sustained substantial damage to the main rotor. The commercial-rated pilot and one 
passenger were not injured. Another passenger received minor injuries. The airplane was
