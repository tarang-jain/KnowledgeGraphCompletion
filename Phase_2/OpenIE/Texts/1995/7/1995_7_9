Factual Information
 On July 1, 1995, about 1645 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 337G, N72168, piloted by Earnest 
O. Bower, was substantially damaged during takeoff from a private grass strip, in Brant, New 
York.  The pilot was not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  There was no 
flight plan for the flight conducted under CFR 14 Part 91.
In the NTSB form 6120.1/2, the pilot stated, 
     Conditions favored takeoff to east.  Normal takeoff      run.  Pilot sneezed, aircraft pitched up 
[and] rotated      prematurely.  Decision to abort takeoff.  Pilot landed.       During roll out, plane 
suddenly turned 90 degrees      left...caused by rock stopping left main wheel. Could      not stop 
before left wing struck power pole.
Additionally, the pilot reported that the winds were from the northwest at 4 knots.  At 
Chautauqua County, Jamestown, New York, about 30 miles to the southwest, the winds were 
reported from 310 degrees at 8 knots.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector stated in his report:
     ...[The] accident occurred as Mr. Bower was attempting      a takeoff from this unimproved 
farm field....In      [this]...accident, the takeoff was attempted with a      tailwind estimated at 8 
to 10 knots and field growth of      approximately 12 inches....The aircraft struck a      utility pole 
at the east end of the field and crossed a      road before stopping.  The takeoff run had begun on 
a      mowed strip approximately 1500 feet long at the west      end of the field, and ended in an 
unmowed area      approximately 2000 feet long at the east end of the      field....
Postaccident examination by the FAA Inspector revealed no anomalies with the engine or 
airframe.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
