CONTAMINATION IN THE FUEL TANKS, FUEL LINES AND GASOLATOR.  THE PILOT 
HAD PURCHASED THE AIRCRAFT JUST PRIOR TO THE FLIGHT.  HE HAD FLOWN THE

Factual Information
 On July 1, 1995, at 1340 eastern daylight time, a Knosp Corbin Jr. Ace-E, N74RK, nosed over 
in a soft field during an emergency landing, after a loss of engine power, near Whiteville, North 
Carolina. The personal flight operated under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91, with no flight 
plan filed. Visual weather conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage, and the pilot received minor injuries. The flight departed 
Southport, North Carolina, at 1300 hours. 
The pilot purchased the aircraft just prior to the flight. He had flown the aircraft before 
purchasing it, and had not experienced any problems with the aircraft.  According to the pilot, 
the airplane was refueled, after he purchased it, with 10 gallons of 100 low lead fuel. He 
sumped the fuel during preflight, and found no fuel contamination.  About 30 minutes into the 
flight, the pilot noticed a gradual loss of engine power. The condition deteriorated to the point 
where the pilot was forced to land. The pilot selected an open field for the emergency landing. 
The airplane touched down in the soft dirt and nosed over.
An examination of the aircraft fuel system revealed rust particles in the fuel.  The gasolator 
bowl was removed. Sludge and rust was found at the bottom of the bowl.  After cleaning the 
fuel system and lines of rust, an engine run was performed.  All systems operated normally.  No 
mechanical malfunction was found.
According to the previous owner of the aircraft, he allowed it to sit for a long period of time 
with a low amount of fuel in the tanks, prior to the current owner's purchase of the aircraft.  
The aircraft was within its annual inspection.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
