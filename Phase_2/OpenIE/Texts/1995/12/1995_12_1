Analysis 
The pilot reported that, while at 4,500 feet msl, the aircraft engine began to run rough, and 
then lost power. The pilot attempted to execute a forced landing on a roadway, but the aircraft 
hit trees during the approach, then it impacted the terrain next to the roadway. Examination of 
the engine revealed that the fuel injector diaphragm and 'O' ring were leaking. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The leaking fuel injector, which created a rich mixture, and caused the aircraft engine to lose 
power.

Factual Information
 On December 1, 1995, at 1130 central standard time, a Bellanca 8KCAB, N53870, was 
substantially damaged following a collision with trees and terrain during a forced landing 
attempt near Alexander City, Alabama. The airline transport pilot received minor injuries in 
the accident. The aircraft was being operated under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91 by the 
pilot. Visual meteorological conditions existed at the time, and a visual flight rules flight plan 
was in effect for the flight. The flight departed Columbus, Georgia, at 1045.
The pilot stated that while at cruise flight at 4,500 feet above mean sea level, the aircraft engine 
began to run roughly, and then stopped producing power. The pilot attempted to execute a 
forced landing on a roadway, but impacted trees, and the terrain during the approach.
Examination of the aircraft engine revealed that the "O" ring and diaphragm in the fuel injector 
servo were leaking. The leaking servo resulted in a rich fuel/air mixtureand subsequent loss of 
engine power.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
