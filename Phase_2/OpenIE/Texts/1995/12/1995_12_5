Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE PILOT ENTERED THE AIRSTRIP TRAFFIC PATTERN AND SET UP FOR A 
DOWNWIND FINAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 9. THE WINDSOCKS WERE INDICATING A 
WIND FROM THE WEST AT 10-12 KNOTS AND FAVORED A LANDING TO THE WEST. AN 
FAA DESIGNATED PILOT EXAMINER FOR GLIDERS WITNESSED THE ACCIDENT AND 
REPORTED THAT THE SPEED AND ALTITUDE OF THE GLIDER WAS SLOW AND LOW. 
THE GLIDER BEGAN A BASE-TO-FINAL TURN ABOUT 50-75 FEET AGL AND THE LEFT 
WING OF THE GLIDER DROPPED. THE EXAMINER SAID THE GLIDER APPEARED TO 
STALL AND THEN DESCEND TO GROUND IMPACT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's selection of the wrong runway for the prevailing wind conditions, and his failure to 
maintain an adequate airspeed during the base-to-final turn.

Factual Information
 On December 1, 1995, at 1418 hours Pacific standard time, a Laister Sailplane LP-15, N6LS, 
collided with the ground during the base-to-final turn while landing at Krey Field, Adelanto, 
California.  The glider was operated as a personal flight when the accident occurred.  The glider 
was destroyed and the certificated private pilot was seriously injured.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed.
Witnesses reported the pilot was towed toward the east to an altitude of 3,000 feet above 
ground level (agl), and the weather conditions at the time of landing favored a landing to the 
west.  The glider was observed on a downwind leg of the traffic pattern heading west into the 
wind.
An FAA designated pilot examiner for gliders witnessed the accident.  The speed and altitude of 
the glider was reported as slow and low.  During the base-to-final turn for runway 09 about 50-
75 feet agl, the left wing of the glider was observed to drop.  The witness said the glider 
appeared to stall and then descend to ground impact.
Examination of the glider by the airport manager after the accident did not reveal any evidence 
of mechanical failure or malfunction.  The field is equipped with three windsocks.  According to 
witnesses, the windsocks were indicating a wind from the west at 10-12 knots at the time of the 
accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
