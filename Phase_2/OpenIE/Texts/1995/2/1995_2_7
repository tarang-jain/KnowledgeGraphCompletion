Factual Information
 On February 2, 1995, at 1745 hours Pacific standard time, a Bellanca 7GCBC, N12207, ground 
looped during the landing roll on runway 27 at Carson City Airport, Carson City, Nevada.  The 
pilot was completing a visual flight rules personal flight.  The airplane, registered to Barclay 
Contractors, Sisters, Oregon, sustained substantial damage.  Neither the certificated private 
pilot nor his passenger were injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed.  The flight 
originated at Redmond Airport, Redmond, Oregon, at 1340 hours.
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness inspector from the Reno (Nevada) 
Flight Standards District Office, reported that the pilot said the touchdown was normal.  
During the landing roll, the airplane swerved to the left and he applied power.  The pilot said 
he perceived that the airplane momentarily straightened out and he applied the brakes.  The 
airplane then swerved to the right and began to skid to the left.  The airplane departed the right 
side of the runway and the left wing struck a dirt berm.
The pilot said in the aircraft accident report that during the landing rollout, he "touched" the 
right brake and the airplane veered to the right.  He reported no mechanical malfunctions.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
