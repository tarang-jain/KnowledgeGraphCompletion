Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
ACCORDING TO THE PILOT'S WIFE, THIS FLIGHT WAS TO BE A GROUND RUN ONLY, 
WITH NO TAKEOFF CONTEMPLATED. THE PILOT & HIS STEPDAUGHTER WERE 
COMPARING ACCELERATIONS AFTER WEIGHT CHANGES FOR A SCHOOL PROJECT. A 
WITNESS OBSERVED FROST ON THE ACFT AS IT TAXIED TO THE RUNWAY. OTHER 
WITNESSES SAW THE ACFT ACCELERATE ON THE RUNWAY, ROTATE, BECOME 
AIRBORNE TO ABOUT FIVE FEET AGL, SETTLE TO THE RUNWAY, BECOME AIRBORNE 
AGAIN, & OVERRUN THE RUNWAY INTO A WIDE RAVINE. IT COLLIDED WITH THE 
OPPOSITE BANK & BURNED. GROUND GOUGES INDICATED THAT THE ACFT WAS 
AIRBORNE FOR 219 FEET PAST THE RUNWAY END. THREE GOUGES, FOR 135 FEET, 
INDICATED THAT THE ACFT WAS IN A SLIGHT LEFT SKID, & THE INCREASING DEPTH 
OF THE GOUGES INDICATED THAT BRAKES WERE APPLIED. THE ACFT CAME TO REST 
UPRIGHT ON A RIGHT OFFSET HEADING, FROM THE ENERGY PATH, OF ABOUT 45 
DEGREES, INDICATING THAT IT VAULTED OVER THE RAVINE UPRIGHT, IN A 45 
DEGREE RIGHT YAW ATTITUDE. THE POST-MORTEM EXAM DID NOT REVEAL 
EVIDENCE OF INCAPACITATION. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's delayed abort of the ground run which resulted in a runway overrun and collision 
with the ravine.

Factual Information
 On February 1, 1995, about 0720 eastern standard time, a  Brandt Rutan Longeze, homebuilt 
airplane, N103JB, collided with an embankment following a ground run on runway 9, 
McCollum Field, Marietta, Georgia. The airplane was operated by the pilot under the 
provisions of 14 CFR Part 91, and visual flight rules. A flight plan was not filed for the personal 
flight. The commercial pilot and his passenger were fatally injured, and the airplane was 
destroyed by impact forces and post impact fire. The flight was originating at the time of the 
accident.
     There was a heavy frost on the morning of the accident, and a witness observed frost on the 
airplane as it taxied to the runway. Another witness observed that an undetermined quantity of 
fuel was added to the airplane from a self service pump. Witnesses observed the airplane taxi 
onto the approach end of runway 9 and commence what appeared to be a takeoff roll. About 
2,000 to 3,000 feet down the 5,105 foot long runway, the nose rotated and the airplane became 
airborne about five feet. It touched down on the runway, then rotated and became airborne a 
second time. Witness marks, consistent with the Longeze's landing gear, that were found in the 
grass overrun, began 219 feet from the end of the runway threshold. A piece of composite 
material was found at the beginning of the ground witness marks. The witness marks 
continued about 276 feet. A wheel pant was found near the east end of the ground marks. The 
center track was consistently closer to the right track, looking east, the direction of the 
aircraft's path. The ground tracks ended about 135 feet prior to an embankment that descended 
at a 45 degree angle into a deep ravine. A second wheel pant was found on the near 
embankment. Witnesses saw the airplane descend into the ravine followed shortly by a large 
fireball. The airplane came to rest against a boulder, on the east side of the ravine. It was 
destroyed by the ensuing ground fire.
     A wet canopy/fuselage cover was located in the pilot's car. Wing covers normally installed on 
the airplane, were not located with it. The pilot's wife stated that the wing covers were at their 
residence being repaired.
     Because of the post-impact fire, examination of the airplane did not produce any cockpit 
documentation.
     The engine, a Lycoming O-235-C1, serial number L-8731-15, was examined. The propeller 
spinner retained its conical shape chordwise, and was crushed inward on one side. Both 
propeller blades were broken and splintered spanwise, and evidenced areas of charring. There 
was fire damage to the underside, right side and the accessory section of the engine. The starter 
ring gear was detached circumferentially. Both magnetos and associated wiring had extensive 
heat damage with the point cover burned away from the right magneto. There was internal fire 
damage to the left magneto, and all of its distributor towers were burned away. The mechanical 
fuel pump cover was absent and there was evidence of fire damage to the pump action. There 
was a hole in the oil sump through which the oil pickup tube and screen could be seen. No 
debris was noted in the screen. The Marvel Schebler carburetor was found in the creek at the 
accident site, detached from the engine. The float bowl contained metal floats and there was no 
evidence of debris or corrosion in the float bowl. One float kidney was crushed from both sides 
toward the centerline of the kidney. 
     According to records obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration, the pilot had 
3,500 total civil flight hours, as of March 31, 1993. He obtained a second class medical 
Page 4 of 6ATL95LA047
certificate on that date, with limitations to wear glasses for distant vision, and possess glasses 
for near vision, when exercising the privileges of the certificate. His pilot log was not located.
     The aircraft logs and records were not located, and the pilot's wife stated that they would 
have been in the airplane.
     A post-mortem examination of the pilot was conducted by the Cobb County, Georgia, Office 
of the Medical Examiner. The cause of death was listed as generalized trauma with associated 
generalized body surface burns. The report stated that "minimal atherosclerotic involvement is 
noted." In reference to the central nervous system, the report stated that "Intrinsic lesions [of 
the brain] are not identified." A report of the toxicological examination of the pilot indicated 
that no ethanol nor other drugs were found.
     The pilot's wife provided the following information regarding the flight and the accident. 
The pilot was assisting his stepdaughter with a school science project. The project was to 
determine the effects of weight on the acceleration of the airplane. It was her understanding 
that no takeoff was contemplated, only a ground run to obtain two additional data points that 
her daughter needed to complete her fact gathering for the project. Mrs. Dahl provided 
anecdotal information that indicated that the pilot was aware of the effects of frost on the 
airplane. She stated that he was a former Naval Aviator, who flew attack aircraft, and had 
extensive aviation experience. She opined that her husband experienced an incapacitating 
event after the first liftoff, which explains his failure to reduce the power, turn off the ignition 
switch, or raise the nose landing gear. She also stated that the back seat, where her daughter 
would have sat, had no controls other than a control stick.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
