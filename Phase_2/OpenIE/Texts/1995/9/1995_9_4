Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
BONHAM, TX
Accident Number:
FTW95LA375
Date & Time:
09/01/1995, 1500 CDT 
Registration:
N5798J
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172N
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The flight's destination was a farm near Bonham. During a low approach over the farm field, 
the pilot decided to abort the landing and go to Jones Field. During the aborted landing, a 
partial loss of engine power occurred. As the airplane descended toward a barn and trees, the 
pilot banked the airplane to the left and missed the barn. The left wing struck trees and the 
airplane impacted the ground coming to rest inverted. During an engine test run throughout a 
range of power settings, no mechanical discrepancies were found. The pilot reported a 102 
degree (F) temperature, an altimeter setting of 30.00, and a site elevation of 600 feet. Utilizing 
this data, the calculated density altitude exceeded 3,000 feet. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PARTIAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS. FACTORS 
WERE THE HIGH DENSITY ALTITUDE AND LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN FOR THE 
FORCED LANDING.

Factual Information
 On September 1, 1995, at 1500 central daylight time, a Cessna 172N, N5798J, collided with 
trees during an aborted landing near Bonham, Texas.  The private pilot and one passenger 
received minor injuries and the other passenger was not injured.  The airplane sustained 
substantial damage.  Centerline Aviation operated the airplane under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal cross country flight and a flight 
plan was not filed.
The pilot reported that the flight had departed Addison, Texas, approximately 1420, en route to 
a farm near Bonham.  During a low approach over the farm field, the pilot decided to abort the 
landing and go to Jones Field at Bonham.  When the pilot "pushed in [the] throttle, plane 
sputtered then resumed power."  On climb out, the airplane "sputtered again."  From 80 to 90 
feet above the ground, the airplane descended to 30 to 50 feet toward a barn and trees.  With 
the airplane continuing the descent, the pilot banked the airplane to the left and missed the 
barn; however, the left wing struck trees and the airplane impacted the ground coming to rest 
nose down.  Structural damage occurred to the firewall, right wing, and fuselage.
An engine test run (sheet enclosed) was conducted in the presence of the owner's 
representative and the FAA inspector.  Throughout a range of power settings, no mechanical 
discrepancies were found. 
The pilot reported a Fahrenheit temperature of 102 degrees, an altimeter setting of 30.00 
inches, and the site elevation as 600 feet.  Utilizing this data, the calculated density altitude 
exceeded 3,000 feet.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
