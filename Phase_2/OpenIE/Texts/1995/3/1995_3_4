Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On March 3, 1995, at 1943 eastern standard time, a Cessna 208B, N227DM, was destroyed 
following a collision with terrain, and a post crash fire, during an instrument approach to the 
Gainesville, Georgia Airport. Both the airline transport/instructor pilot and the 
private/instrument rated pilot were fatally injured in the accident. The aircraft was being 
operated under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 by D.M.C. Flying 
Service, at the time of the accident. Instrument meteorological conditions existed at the time of 
the accident, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was in effect for the flight. The flight 
departed Savannah, Georgia, at 1730.
All radio communications with the aircraft were reported to be normal. The flight had been 
cleared by the Atlanta Air Route Traffic Control Center for the Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) 
approach and cleared to change radio frequencies to the advisory channel. Witnesses reported 
observing the aircraft descend out of the base of the overcast clouds in a 10 degree nose down, 
45 degree left wing down attitude.  The aircraft impacted the trees and terrain about 3/4 mile 
south southeast of the airport. The trees and terrain at the impact area were approximately 
1200 feet above mean sea level.
A pilot, flying on an instrument flight plan, and practicing   instrument approaches in the area 
at the time of the accident, reported the following. He stated that at the time of the accident, he 
was in a holding pattern waiting for N227DM to complete the approach into Gainesville (GVL). 
He heard the conversations between Atlanta Approach Control, and the pilot of N227DM, and 
reported that all conversations were normal. He stated that he had departed Peachtree-Dekalb 
Airport (PDK), and executed several practice approaches into PDK. He reported that the cloud 
base at PDK was about 300 feet above ground level (AGL), and that the clouds were solid up to 
5,000 feet above mean sea level (MSL). He said that there was no ice accumulation noted 
during his flight. He stated that during the approaches into PDK, he could see lights straight 
down below the aircraft about 500 feet AGL, but that there was no forward visibility through 
the clouds. He did not execute the approach into GVL, because N227DM did not report the 
approach complete. He stated that he did not expect to see the Gainesville Airport had he 
executed the approach, as the cloud base at PDK was below the minimum descent altitude for 
GVL.(See Record of Conversation With Mr. Johnny Masters Attached to This Report.)

The aircraft impacted the terrain in a wooded area about 3/4 of a mile south southeast of the 
Lee Gilmer Memorial Airport. The terrain elevation in the area of the accident site is about 
1200 feet above mean sea level.(See Copy of Topographical Map of Area Attached to This 
Report).
The wreckage was distributed over an area about 319 feet in length, on a magnetic heading of 
240 degrees. There were trees, eight inches in diameter at the base, about eighty feet in height 
located at the beginning of the wreckage path. The trees were broken off about 50 feet above 
ground level. The elevator trim tab and elevator counter weight were the first pieces of the 
aircraft wreckage located in the direction of impact from the broken trees. The elevator trim 
tab and counterweight were located 90 feet in the direction of impact from the beginning of the 
wreckage site. The trim tab had a "U" shaped indention on the outboard leading edge.
An outboard section of the right aileron, about three feet in length was located about 25 feet, in 
the direction of impact from the elevator trim tab. there was a "U" shaped indention in the 
aileron.
The aircraft engine displayed severe impact damage including complete separation of the 
reduction and accessory gearbox housings, separation of the flange "C" retaining bolts, and 
moderate to severe compressional deformation of the exhaust duct and gas generator case. 
Severe circumferential rubbing and machining were displayed by the compressor turbine disc 
and interstage baffle, and the power turbine disc and baffle. The compressor 1st stage blade 
tips and shroud displayed strong circumferential rubbing.
There was no indication of pre-impact failure of the aircraft flight controls. The aircraft 
propeller showed signs of chordwise scratching and twisting toward low pitch.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
An autopsy of the left seat pilot was conducted by Dr. Steven F. Dunton, the Medical Examiner 
for the city of Gainesville, Georgia, on March 4, 1995.
A toxicological examination of the left seat pilot was conducted by the Toxicology and Accident 
Research Laboratory of the Federal Aviation Administration in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The 
toxicology report was negative for the use of drugs and alcohol.
An autopsy of the right seat pilot was conducted by Dr. Steven F. Dunton, the Medical 
Examiner for the city of Gainesville, Georgia, on March 4, 1995.
A toxicological examination of the right seat pilot was conducted by the Federal Aviation 
Administration Toxicology and Accident Research Laboratory in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. 
The toxicology report was negative for the use of drugs. The report showed 11.000 milliliters 
per deciliter (0.01%) ethanol in the blood, 6.000 milliliters per deciliter (0.01%) acetaldehyde 
in the blood, and 1.000 milliliters per deciliter (0.001%) acetaldehyde in the lung fluid. The 
report noted that the ethanol found in this case is most likely from postmortem ethanol 
production.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
