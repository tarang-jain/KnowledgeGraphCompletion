Analysis 
STRUCTURAL ICE ACCUMULATED ON THE AIRPLANE AT A RAPID RATE WHILE THE 
PILOT WAS EXECUTING A PROCEDURE TURN DURING AN NDB APPROACH TO HIS 
DESTINATION AIRPORT. THE PILOT APPLIED MAXIMUM AVAILABLE POWER BUT WAS 
UNABLE TO ARREST THE RATE OF DESCENT. THE PILOT MAINTAINED 110 KNOTS 
DURING THE APPROACH AND AFTER BREAKING OUT INTO VISUAL CONDITIONS 
ELECTED TO PERFORM A FORCED LANDING IN AN OPEN FIELD 2 MILES SHORT OF 
THE DESTINATION AIRPORT. THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO ARREST HIS DESCENT AND 
THE AIRPLANE IMPACTED THE GROUND IN A 5 DEGREE NOSE DOWN ATTITUDE. THE 
PILOT ALSO STATED THAT HIS FORWARD VISIBILITY WAS COMPLETELY OBSCURED 
BY THE ACCUMULATION OF CLEAR ICE ON THE WINDSHIELD. THE AIRPORT 
MANAGER INFORMED THE PILOT THAT FREEZING DRIZZLE WAS PRESENT AT THE 
AIRPORT WHEN THE PILOT CALLED THE UNICOM DURING THE INITIAL PORTION OF 
THE INSTRUMENT APPROACH. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S CONTINUED FLIGHT INTO ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS. FACTORS 
WERE THE ICING CONDITIONS PREVAILING AT THE DESTINATION AIRPORT, AND 
THE PILOT'S INABILITY TO MAINTAIN VISUAL LOOKOUT DUE TO WINDSHIELD ICING.

Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On March 2, 1995, at 0815 central standard time, a Cessna 208B, N9448B, was substantially 
damaged during a forced landing near Ardmore, Oklahoma.  The instrument rated commercial 
pilot suffered minor injuries.  The airplane, operating under the callsign Martinaire 633, was 
owned by Cessna Finance Corporation, of Wichita, Kansas, and operated by MartinAire of 
Dallas, Texas.  Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the 14 CFR Part 135 cargo 
flight.
According to the operator, the airplane departed the Tulsa International Airport (TUL), at 0715 
with a payload of 1,300 pounds of cargo, destined for the Ardmore Downtown Executive 
Airport (1F0).  A weather briefing was received and an instrument flight plan filed.
The pilot stated he was cleared for the NDB Runway 35 Approach to Ardmore while level at 
5,000 feet.  The pilot further stated that as he proceeded from the VOR to the NDB for the 
procedure turn, the airplane accumulated ice at a rapid rate.  The pilot stated that he added 
maximum available power, as he continued to cycle the wing/strut deicing boots. 
The pilot stated that the airplane was configured with flaps up, airspeed at 110 knots when he 
broke out into visual conditions at approximately 400 feet AGL.  The pilot further stated that 
he was unable to arrest the 400 to 500 fpm rate of descent to hold altitude.  The airplane 
impacted in an open pasture in a nose low attitude.  The nose landing gear separated, the 
mains collapsed, and the cargo pod was crushed.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
The pilot who is home-based at Tulsa, Oklahoma, stated that he had been on duty since 2130 
the previous night, and had flown a total of 4.2 hours during the same duty period.  His last 
training session and check ride were completed on February 24, 1995.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
The 1988 model airplane was issued a normal category airworthiness certificate on September 
22, 1988.  The airplane was certified as a single pilot aircraft, certified for flights into known 
light to moderate icing conditions.  The airplane was not equipped with deicing boots for the 
nosecap of the cargo pod or the landing gear struts. 
A review of the airframe and engine records by the FAA inspector, did not reveal any 
anomalies, uncorrected maintenance, or overdue airworthiness directives.  All of the aircraft's 
deicing and anti-icing systems were reported as operational prior to the flight.  The pilot had 
not reported any maintenance anomalies prior to the flight; however, during a post-accident 
interview the pilot stated that forward visibility through the detachable electric windshield 
anti-ice panel was inadequate, and his forward visibility was completely obscured by the 
accumulation of clear ice on the windshield.
A review of the loading of the airplane revealed that at the time of the accident, the airplane 
was being operated within the prescribed weight and balance limits. 
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
The Automatic Weather Observation System (AWOS) weather report for Ardmore for 0700 
CST was reported as sky partially obscured, 700 overcast, with a mile and a half visibility in 
Page 4 of 7FTW95FA129
drizzle.  Temperature was 26 degrees, with a dew point of 25 degrees.  The weather minimums 
for the NDB Runway 35 approach were 638 feet and 1 mile visibility.
COMMUNICATIONS
The pilot informed the airport manager on the Unicom frequency, that he had the current 
AWOS weather, and he was executing the NDB Runway 35 approach.  The airport manager 
stated that he informed the pilot that freezing drizzle was present and the pilot acknowledged 
the transmission.  His last radio transmission occurred when the pilot reported "procedure 
turn inbound" to the Unicom.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The airplane impacted on an open pasture approximately 2 miles south of the approach end of 
runway 35, and one mile west of the extended centerline.  Ground scars were found at the 
initial point of impact on a measured heading of 155 degrees.  Chunks of rime and mixed ice 
contoured to the shape of several parts of the aircraft were found at the initial point of impact.  
The nose wheel strut and several other components associated with the nose wheel were found 
within 20 feet of the initial point of impact.
After sliding for approximately 100 yards, the airplane came to rest on a measured magnetic 
heading of 330 degrees.  All three composite blades separated at the hub.  The spinner and hub 
assembly remained attached to the propeller shaft.  The two main landing gears were found 
pushed aft and up, touching the respective wing strut.  The belly cargo pod was crushed up and 
to the left.
The wing flaps were found extended to 20 degrees.  The elevator trim was found in the full nose 
up position.  The engine inertial separator was found in the bypass mode. 
ADDITIONAL DATA
The wreckage was released to the owner's representative on March 2, 1995, following 
completion of the field portion of the investigation.
A teardown of the propeller was performed at the propeller manufacturer's facility.  A copy of 
the examination report is enclosed.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
