Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
THE PILOT SAID THAT WHEN HE TRIED TO MAKE A THROTTLE ADJUSTMENT IT HAD 
NO EFFECT ON THE ENGINE RPM. AFTER ENTERING DOWNWIND ABEAM HIS 
TOUCHDOWN POINT, HE SHUT DOWN THE ENGINE AND ATTEMPTED TO GLIDE THE 
REMAINDER OF THE DISTANCE. THE AIRCRAFT TOUCHED DOWN SHORT OF THE 
RUNWAY AND STRUCK AN EMBANKMENT. AN INSPECTION OF THE AIRCRAFT 
REVEALED THAT THE THROTTLE LINKAGE HAD SEPARATED FROM THE 
CARBURETOR THROTTLE ARM. THE BOLT, CASTELLATED NUT, AND WASHER WHICH 
SECURES THE ASSEMBLY TOGETHER WERE NOT PRESENT. THE ENGINE WAS 
REINSTALLED IN THE AIRCRAFT FOLLOWING A MAJOR OVERHAUL, 1 MONTH AND 2 
OPERATING HOURS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. AN ANNUAL INSPECTION WAS ALSO 
COMPLETED AND SIGNED OFF AT THAT TIME. THE MECHANIC WHO PERFORMED 
THE ENGINE REINSTALLATION SAID THAT THE BOLT HAD BEEN REINSTALLED AND 
THAT A COTTER PIN HAD ALSO BEEN INSTALLED IN THE PROCESS. THE MECHANIC 
WHO PERFORMED THE ANNUAL INSPECTION REPORTED THAT HE HAD NOT LOOKED 
THAT CLOSELY AT THE ENGINE SINCE IT HAD JUST BEEN INSTALLED AND 
INSPECTED BY ANOTHER MECHANIC. THE MANUFACTURER REPORTED THAT THE 
DESIGN OF THE ASSEMBLY DOES NOT PLACE LOADS ON THE BOLT THAT WOULD BE 
SUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE AN OVERLOAD FAILURE. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the separation of the throttle linkage due to improper installation, and the pilot's 
misjudgement of the glide path necessary to reach the runway prior to shutting down the 
engine.

Factual Information
 On May 2, 1995, at 1136 hours Pacific daylight time, a Beechcraft C23, N6636R, sustained 
substantial damage during a landing approach at Red Bluff, California.  The aircraft was owned 
and operated by the pilot and was on a cross-country flight.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed at the time, and a VFR flight plan was filed for the operation.  The certificated 
commercial pilot and his pilot-rated passenger both sustained serious injuries.  The flight 
originated from the Half Moon Bay airport in Half Moon Bay, California, at 1000 on the day of 
the accident.
The pilot reported that when he attempted to make a throttle adjustment, he was able to move 
the throttle control, however, it had no effect on the engine rpm.  He reported that he was 
about 8 to 10 miles from the Red Bluff airport at the time, and continued on to his destination.  
After entering downwind for runway 15 and abeam his touchdown point, the pilot shut down 
the engine and attempted to glide the remainder of the distance on the approach.  The aircraft 
touched down short of the airport boundary and struck an embankment.
A postaccident inspection of the aircraft by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
airworthiness inspector revealed that the throttle linkage between the throttle lever and the 
throttle rod end was separated.  The connecting bolt (AN3-6), with a castellated locking nut 
(M21042L3), and smooth spacer (AN960-10), were all missing.  
On April 20, 1995, the engine was reinstalled in the aircraft after a major overhaul.  The engine 
controls were rigged and an operational check of all powerplant systems and controls was 
performed.  According to an entry in the aircraft logbook, the aircraft was test flown and 
returned to service with total time on the airframe of 2,220 hours, and an engine tachometer 
reading of 2,220 hours.
On May 1, 1995, the aircraft completed an annual inspection and was found to be airworthy.  
An airframe and powerplant mechanic with inspection authorization, made an airworthiness 
entry in the aircraft logbook with total time for the airframe and engine of 2,220 hours.
At the time of the accident, the engine tachometer read 2,223 hours.  The mechanic who 
performed the reinstallation reported to FAA inspectors that the bolt had been reinstalled and 
that a cotter pin had also been installed in the process.  The mechanic who performed the 
annual inspection reported to FAA inspectors that he had not looked that closely at the engine 
since it had just been installed and inspected by another mechanic.
The manufacturer reported that the design of the assembly does not place loads on the bolt 
that would be sufficient to produce an overload failure.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
