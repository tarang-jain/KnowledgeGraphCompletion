N63522
Aircraft:
CESSNA 150M
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:

1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
THE AIRPLANE CONTAINED 18 GALLONS OF FUEL (3 GALLONS UNUSABLE) WHEN 
THE STUDENT PILOT DEPARTED ON THE ROUND ROBIN SOLO CROSS-COUNTRY 
FLIGHT.  ON THE RETURN LEG OF THE FLIGHT THE ENGINE SUSTAINED A TOTAL 
LOSS OF POWER DUE TO FUEL EXHAUSTION.  THE AIRPLANE NOSED OVER DURING 
THE LANDING ROLL WHEN IT ENTERED A RIVER.  EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE 
DISCLOSED THE WING FUEL TANKS CONTAINED LESS THAT 4 GALLONS.  THE MEAN 
FUEL CONSUMPTION AT ALTITUDE (NOT INCLUDING TAKEOFF, CLIMBS, AND 
LANDING) IS 5.7 GPH.  THE ACTUAL FUEL CONSUMPTION CALCULATION FOR THE 
FLIGHT WAS 5.8 GALLONS PER HOUR. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the CFI's failure to adequately supervise the flight; and the student pilot's poor preflight 
planning/preparation and fuel consumption calculations.

Factual Information
 On October 2, 1995, at 1645 hours Pacific daylight time, a Cessna 150M, N63522, nosed over 
during the landing roll after colliding with a river bank about 4 miles west of Fillmore, 
California.  The student pilot was executing an emergency landing due to a total loss of power.  
He was conducting his third solo cross-country visual flight rules instructional flight and was 
returning to Camarillo Airport, Camarillo, California.  The airplane, operated by a private 
individual, sustained substantial damage.  The student pilot was not injured.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed.  The flight originated at Camarillo Airport at 1400 hours; 
the flight departed California City Municipal Airport at 1530 hours.
The pilot said in a telephone interview conducted on October 2, 1995, that the airplane fuel 
gauges indicated that the fuel tanks contained about 3/4 tank of fuel when he departed 
Camarillo Airport.  He did not refuel at California City.  The airplane is equipped with long 
range fuel tanks that contain 35 gallons of useable fuel.
The pilot submitted the required Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report, NTSB Form 
6120.1/2.  He said in the report that the airplane contained 18 gallons of fuel when he departed 
Camarillo Airport.  He also said that he flew to California City at 7,500 feet mean sea level 
(msl) and returned at 6,500 feet msl.
The pilot said in a telephone interview conducted on January 26, 1996, that the flight 
instructor looked at his proposed flight log momentarily, but she did not "go over it in great 
detail," nor did she supervise the preflight inspection.  He said that he used the dipstick to 
determine the amount of fuel onboard the airplane.
The operator reported that the airplane contained less that 2 gallons of fuel in each fuel tank.  
According to the Hobbsmeter, the airplane flew 2.6 hours on the accident flight.  The overall 
fuel consumption rate was 5.8 gph (15 gallons/2.6 hours).
According to the Cessna 150M Owner's Manual, the maximum fuel consumption at 7,500 and 
6,500 feet msl are 5.5 gallons per hour (gph) and 6.0 gph, respectively.  This fuel consumption 
rate is based on using appropriate leaning techniques and does not account for takeoff, climb, 
and landing configurations.  The owner's manual also states that the unusable fuel is 3.0 
gallons.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
