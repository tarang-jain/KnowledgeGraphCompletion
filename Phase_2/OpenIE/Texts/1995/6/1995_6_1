Analysis 
THE PILOT LANDED ON A 2,600-FOOT WET, SOD RUNWAY.  UPON TOUCHDOWN, THE 
PILOT HELD THE AIRPLANE ON THE CENTERLINE BY USING THE RUDDER AND THE 
BRAKES.  THE NOSE WHEEL OF THE AIRPLANE IS NON-STEERABLE.  
APPROXIMATELY THREE-QUARTERS DOWN THE RUNWAY, THE PILOT LOST 
CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE, AND IT SUDDENLY VEERED RIGHT.  THE AIRPLANE 
COLLIDED WITH TERRAIN, AND CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP 10 FEET OFF THE 
RUNWAY.  SUBSEQUENTLY, REPAIRS WERE MADE TO THE AIRPLANE THAT 
INCLUDED REBUILDING THE LEFT BRAKE CALIPER BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE 
BRAKE AUTHORITY. 
Probable Cause and Findings

AN INOPERATIVE LEFT MAIN WHEEL BRAKE THAT RESULTED IN A LOSS OF 
DIRECTIONAL CONTROL.  A FACTOR WAS THE WET, GRASS RUNWAY.

Factual Information
 On June 1, 1995, about 1200 eastern daylight time, an American AA-1, N6241L, collided with 
the terrain, during the landing roll, at the Country Squire Airport, near Rock Hill, South 
Carolina.  The airplane was operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91, and 
visual flight rules.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed. No flight plan was filed for the 
personal flight. There were no injuries to the commercial pilot, and the airplane was 
substantially damaged.  Origination of the flight was Huntersville, North Carolina at 1120 
eastern daylight time. 
According to the pilot, he entered a left pattern for runway 09 at Country Squire Airport.  He 
observed that the wind was out of  the south at approximately 10 knots. He stated that he made 
a full flap landing on the first quarter of the wet, sod runway.  He held the aircraft on the center 
of the runway with rudder and brakes while holding right aileron into the wind.  The pilot 
indicated that the roll out was normal until reaching the last quarter of the 2600 foot runway. 
The aircraft suddenly veered right and collided with terrain.  The aircraft came to a stop ten 
feet off the runway. 
An airworthiness inspector from the South Carolina Flight Standards District Office inspected 
the aircraft after the accident. Both brakes operated as intended. He noted that the airplane is 
equipped with a castering nose wheel that is non-steerable.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
