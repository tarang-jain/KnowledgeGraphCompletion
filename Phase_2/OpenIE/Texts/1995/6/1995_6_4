Factual Information
 On June 1, 1995, at 1355 central daylight time, a Cessna 120, N76856, sustained substantial 
damage during landing near College Station, Texas.  The commercial pilot was not injured.  
Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight.    
According to witnesses at the airport, the airplane was executing a touch and go landing on 
Runway 10 at the Easterwood Airport (CLL).  The pilot made a wheel landing and was rolling 
on the main tires when control was lost and the airplane departed the runway to the left.  The 
main gear tires stuck in the soft mud at the edge of the runway and the airplane nosed over 
coming to rest in the inverted position, resulting in damage to the wings and fuselage. 
The pilot stated that he was cleared to follow a Saab 340 airplane to land on runway 10.  The 
pilot estimated that he had a two mile separation behind the landing regional airliner.  The 
pilot stated that directional control could not be maintained after encountering the wing vortex 
wake turbulence from the landing aircraft.  He further stated that the light quartering tailwind 
prevailing at the time of the accident contributed to the accident.  Wind was from 200 degrees 
at 4 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
