Analysis 
THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO TAKEOFF FROM A GRASS RUNWAY WITH A DIRECT 10 TO 
12 KNOT CROSSWIND.  HE STATED 'A GUST OF WIND PUT US AIRBORNE MUCH 
BEFORE I WAS READY TO BRING UP THE TAIL...BLEW US COMPLETELY OFF THE 
RUNWAY.'  THE LANDING GEAR CAUGHT THE TOP STRAND OF A BARBED WIRE 
FENCE.  THE PILOT REPORTED THE AIRPLANE PULLED UP ABOUT 1,000 FEET OF 
FENCE BEFORE THE AIRPLANE WAS PULLED BACK TO THE GROUND. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions during the attempted takeoff.  The 
gusty crosswind was a factor.

Factual Information
 On April 2, 1995, at 1146 central daylight time, a Bellanca 7ECA, N2598Z, piloted by the 
owner/operator, crashed during an aborted takeoff at a private grass airstrip in Higginsville, 
Missouri.  The airplane sustained substantial damage when it struck a barbed wire fence, then 
impacted terrain.  The private pilot and the one passenger on board the airplane received 
serious injuries.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight, no flight plan 
was filed.  The pleasure flight operated under 14 CFR Part 91, and the accident occurred during 
the intended takeoff.     
The pilot reported he attempted to takeoff from the 2,300' X 100' grass runway with a direct 
crosswind which he estimate to be 10 to 12 knots.  He stated "...a gust of wind put us airborne 
much before I was ready to bring up the tail.  The wind gust blew us completely off the runway.  
Unknowingly, as I was attempting to get back to the runway, I picked up the top strand of 
barbed wire...I pulled up about 1,000 feet of fence before it stopped my flight and caused the 
plane to crash onto the runway."  The pilot stated the accident could have been prevented if he 
had been "...very wary of strong crosswinds, particularly when buildings or obstructions are 
adjacent to runway."

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
