Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The tail-wheel airplane was substantially damaged during landing when it departed runway 27 
(4,198 feet by 100 feet, asphalt) and nosed over.  The pilot noted that the intended destination 
was a planned fuel stop en route to his final destination.  He stated that upon "entering the 
traffic pattern, it was apparent that the winds were stronger than forecast from the south.  
Upon landing, a gust of wind struck the plane."  The airplane subsequently departed the 
runway pavement and nosed over.  Surface winds in the vicinity were reported to be from 210 
degrees at 19 knots, gusting to 30 knots.  The pilot noted that there were no malfunctions 
associated with the airplane prior to the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions and his subsequent failure to 
maintain directional control during landing.  The crosswind and wind gusts were contributing 
factors.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
