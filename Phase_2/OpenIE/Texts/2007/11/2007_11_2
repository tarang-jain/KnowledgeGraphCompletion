Location:
Lafayette, IN
Accident Number:
CHI08CA035
Date & Time:
11/01/2007, 1714 EDT 
Registration:
N5912Q
Aircraft:
Mooney M20E
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Business
Analysis   
The airplane was in cruise flight at 6,500 feet when the engine began to run roughly.  The pilot 
verified both magnetos were functioning properly, switched fuel tanks, and manipulated the 
throttle without any improvement in engine operation.  He informed air traffic control of the 
loss of engine power and was subsequently cleared to land at an airport about 8 nm north of 
his position.  The engine continued to run roughly as he maneuvered for the airport.  The 
airplane impacted rising terrain that preceded the runway threshold.  The airplane came to rest 
within 100 feet of the threshold.  The airplane received substantial damage to the right wing 
and engine firewall.  The nose and right main landing gear collapsed during the landing.  The 
left main landing gear remained fully extended.  Examination of the engine revealed that the 
number 3 cylinder had separated from the engine case.  Further examination showed that the 
number 3 connecting rod had separated from the crankshaft.  The connecting rod cap, two rod 
bolts, and two nuts were found separated inside the engine case.  One of the rod bolts was bent 
and fractured approximately mid-span.  One-half of this bolt remained with the rod cap.  The 
bolt's fracture surface exhibited a cup/cone shape, consistent with an overload failure.  The 
threaded region of this bolt was undamaged. One of the nuts had undamaged threads.  The 
first three threads adjacent to the flat side of the remaining nut were damaged.  The remaining 
rod bolt was intact, but the three threads from the end were damaged consistent with the 
damage noted on the second nut.  The last engine overhaul was completed on November 19, 
1972.  The engine had accumulated 820 hours since that overhaul.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The improper installation of the connecting rod bolts during major overhaul, which resulted in 
the separation of the connecting rod from the crankshaft in flight.  Contributing to the accident 
was the rising terrain encountered during touchdown and the subsequent landing gear 
collapse.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
