Analysis   
The pilot was returning to the airport after releasing some skydivers.  He was following a 
training airplane in the traffic pattern and was gaining on it, so he decided to extend his 
downwind leg.  On final approach to runway 08, his airplane was still gaining on the other 
airplane.  The pilot reduced power and raised the nose to reduce airspeed to 85 mph.  The 
airplane was "low and slow" as he passed over a lake, so he added power but not soon enough.  
The airplane touched down on the sandy shore of the lake short of the runway.  The nose gear 
was torn off and the airplane nosed over.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's misjudgment of altitude.  Contributing factors in this accident were the pilot's 
intentional low airspeed, his failure to execute a go-around, and the soft terrain.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
