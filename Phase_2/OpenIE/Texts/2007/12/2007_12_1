Analysis 
The flight instructor and student pilot returned to the airport to do touch-and-go landings. 
Following the first touch-and-go, the airplane climbed to about 200 feet above the runway, and 
the engine started to run rough and lose rpm. The flight instructor attempted to return to the 
runway. He reported that the airplane landed hard about 80 feet short of a water retention 
pond, and rolled into the pond, coming to rest inverted. He said there were no known 
mechanical problems with the airplane prior to the accident, and that during the accident the 
tail was separated from the cabin section. The airplane was not examined by the NTSB, and it 
is unknown what precipitated the loss of engine power.

On December 1, 2007, about 1645 Eastern standard time, a Cessna 152 airplane, N169LC, 
sustained substantial damage during an in-flight collision with terrain, following an emergency 
descent and landing after takeoff, at the Kendall-Tamiami Executive Airport, Miami, Florida. 
The airplane was being operated by the pilot as a visual flight rules (VFR) instructional flight 
under Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred. The commercial certificated flight 
instructor and student pilot were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and

the runway when the engine started to run rough and lose rpm.  According to the flight 
instructor, he declared an emergency, and attempted to return to the runway. He reported that 
he was unable to make the runway, the airplane landed hard about 80 feet short of a water 
retention pond, and rolled into the pond, coming to rest inverted. He said there were no known

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
