Analysis   
The pilot reported that he normally sets the altimeter to zero prior to takeoff.  The pilot 
reported that he was distracted during the preflight and he forgot to reset the altimeter which 
was set to field elevation, approximately 1,000 feet.  This resulted in the pilot releasing from 
the tow 1,000 feet lower than what he thought he was.  The pilot stated the glider hit the tops of 
trees while on final approach.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inattentiveness during the aircraft preflight and his failure to maintain clearance 
above the trees.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
