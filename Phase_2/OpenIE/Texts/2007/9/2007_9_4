Analysis   
The pilot lost directional control of the tail-wheel equipped biplane while attempting to takeoff 
from a 3,000-foot long, by 100-foot wide grass airstrip.  The 2,500-hour private pilot reported 
that during the takeoff roll from Runway 35, the vintage airplane began to drift to the left side 
of the airstrip.  The pilot added that he attempted to maintain directional control by applying 
full right rudder and aileron; however, the airplane continued to veer to the left and exiting the 
left side of the runway into soft terrain.  The airplane nosed over and came to rest in the 
inverted position.  The pilot was able to egress the airplane with the assistance of a friend.  The 
79-year old pilot reported having accumulated approximately 1,000-hours in the same make 
and model airplane.  Weather at the airport 7 minutes prior to the mishap was reported as 
winds from 085 degrees at 2 to 5 knots, visibility 10 miles with skies clear, temperature 29 
degrees Celsius, dew point 15 degrees Celsius, and altimeter 30.10 inches of Mercury.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during takeoff resuting in a nose over.  A 
contributing factor was the soft terrain.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
