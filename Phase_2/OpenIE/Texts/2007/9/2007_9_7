Location:
Mesa, AZ
Accident Number:
LAX07CA262
Date & Time:
09/01/2007, 1546 MST 
Registration:
N546SW
Aircraft:
Wessel Vortex
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The gyrocopter collided with high vegetation and rough terrain during a forced autorotation 
following the in-flight separation of a propeller blade.  The pilot reported that the muffler's 
mounting strap broke during cruise flight, which caused one composite pusher propeller blade 
to separate.  The pilot autorotated to a forced landing in a ravine.  During touchdown the 
gyrocopter rolled over upon impacting 5-foot-high bushes.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Failure of the muffler's mounting strap and subsequent loss of engine power due to propeller 
blade separation during cruise flight.  A contributing factor was the unsuitable terrain for a 
forced landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
