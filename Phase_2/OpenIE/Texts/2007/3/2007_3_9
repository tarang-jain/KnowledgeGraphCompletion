Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The airplane veered off the runway and collided with a ditch.  During the landing rollout, the 
airplane started to veer to the right of runway centerline.  The CFI allowed the student, who 
had a total time of 3 hours, to attempt to correct the airplane's track back to runway centerline 
until it became evident that the student was not able to do so.  The instructor then assumed 
control and tried to correct the ground track. The student kept his feet on the brakes in an 
attempt to help the instructor slow the airplane.  The airplane departed off the right side of the 
runway, and continued for about 200 feet until it impacted a ditch.  The CFI stated that the 
airplane and engine had no mechanical failures or malfunctions during the flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the student pilot's failure to maintain directional during the landing rollout and the certified 
flight instructor's inadequate supervision.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
