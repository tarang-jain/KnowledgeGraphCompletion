Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
WILLIS, VA
Accident Number:
BFO94LA001
Date & Time:
11/01/1993, 0849 EST 
Registration:
N94440
Aircraft:
UNIVAIR ERCOUPE 415E
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that while cruising at an altitude of 3,500 feet mean sea level, he attempted 
to increase power.  He said that at that point, he lost throttle control and the engine went to 
idle.  The pilot executed a forced landing and collided with the top of automobile in a 
residential area during the landing. Because of the mountainous, forested terrain he said he 
was unable to reach a suitable landing area.  An examination of the airplane revealed the 
throttle cable assembly fitting failed and separated from its housing which prevented the pilot 
from manipulating the throttle. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the failure of the airplane's throttle cable fitting due to undetermined reasons, which prevented 
the pilot from applying power above engine idle.  A factor in this accident was the lack of 
suitable terrain for the pilot to complete a forced landing without damaging the airplane.

Factual Information
 On November 1, 1993, about 0849 hours eastern standard time, a Univair Ercoupe 415E, 
N94440 collided with objects at the termination of a forced landing.  The forced landing was 
precipitated by a loss of engine power during cruise flight.  The certificated private pilot was 
not injured and the airplane sustained substantial damage.  The personal flight, being operated 
by the pilot/owner, originated in Blacksburg, Virginia and was destined for Apalachicola, 
Florida.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed.
An FAA safety inspector examined the airplane on scene and interviewed the pilot.  The pilot 
said that when he reduced power, the throttle cable assembly became loose.  He said that he 
could not regain power and that the power remained at idle.  An examination conducted by the 
FAA safety inspector revealed a throttle cable assembly fitting separated from its housing 
which would not allow the pilot to manipulate the throttle. 
In his written report, the pilot added that because of mountainous terrain, he was unable to 
reach suitable terrain to complete the forced landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
