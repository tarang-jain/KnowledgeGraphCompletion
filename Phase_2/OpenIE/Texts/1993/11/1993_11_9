Analysis 
THE AIRPLANE WAS FLOWN ON A CHECK FLIGHT AFTER MAINTENANCE FOR AN OIL-
AND-FILTER CHANGE AND REPLACEMENT OF LEAKING GASKETS.  DURING THE 
INITIAL CLIMB AFTER TAKEOFF, THE PILOT NOTED A MOMENTARY LOSS OF POWER, 
PROMPTING A TURN TOWARDS THE AIRPORT.  THE ENGINE LOST ALL POWER IN THE 
TURN.  DURING A LANDING SHORT OF THE RUNWAY, THE AIRPLANE HIT A FENCE. 
THE MAIN FUEL LINE CONNECTION TO THE FUEL PUMP WAS FOUND LOOSE.  WHEN 
THE BOOST PUMP WAS ENERGIZED, THE LOOSE FITTING LEAKED SUBSTANTIALLY. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A LOOSE FUEL LINE FITTING, DUE TO IMPROPER MAINTENANCE, WHICH RESULTED 
IN AN INTERUPTION OF FUEL TO THE ENGINE.

Factual Information
 On November 3, 1993, at 1611 central standard time, a Beech B36TC airplane, N8006R, 
experienced a loss of engine power during climb from takeoff, turned back, and landed short at 
Rockford, Illinois.  The solo commercial pilot reported no injury.  The airplane was 
substantially damaged.  Visual meteorological conditions existed for the local, post-
maintenance check flight.  The flight commenced at 1610 and operated under 14 CFR 91.
The airplane went into maintenance on the accident date for an oil-and-filter change and 
replacement of leaking gaskets.  At completion, maintenance personnel cleaned the engine and 
ran it on the ramp.  The pilot for the owner intended a flight around the airport to check the 
airplane before departing to the airplane's home field.
The pilot recounted the engine coughed passing 200 to 300 feet above takeoff altitude.  He 
turned toward the airport and notified the tower of engine difficulty.  The engine lost power 
completely in the turn.  The pilot estimated he would not make the runway, and aimed for open 
ground at the southwest corner of the airport.  He stated he moved the gear selector down, but 
the gear were in transit at touchdown.  He stated he did not select fuel boost ON.
Examination of fuel pump disclosed no mechanical abnormalities, but did show a loose fitting 
where the main fuel line connects to the fuel pump inlet.  Pressurizing the line with the boost 
pump resulted in substantial fuel leakage.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
