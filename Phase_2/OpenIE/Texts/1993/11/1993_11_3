Factual Information
 On November 1, 1993, about 1544 eastern standard time, N210TK, a Cessna P210-N, operated 
by Prop Jet International Inc., ditched off the beach in Fort Lauderdale, Florida after an engine 
failure on a 14 CFR 91 ferry flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and 
an IFR flight plan had been filed and activated. The airplane was not recovered and is 
presumed to be destroyed, and the pilot received minor injuries. The flight originated from 
Robert Owens International Airport, Grand Cayman, about 1400 the same day.
     The pilot stated that while descending to 3,000 feet he added power to level off and the 
engine began to run rough and eventually quit. He then declared an emergency and executed a 
forced landing, ditching to the ocean. He exited the airplane after touchdown and inflated his 
PFD and raft. About 45 minutes later he was rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard. The airplane was 
not recovered from the water therefore the airplane and engine could not be examined.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
