Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On November 3, 1993, at 2135 central standard time, a Mooney M20L, N132MP, collided with 
trees and terrain about two miles south-southeast of the John A. Baker Field in Hohenwald, 
Tennessee. The private pilot and one passenger were fatally injured. The aircraft was destroyed 
by impact forces and fire. Night, instrument meteorological conditions existed at the time, and 
no flight plan was filed for the business flight to Hohenwald. The flight originated in 
Clarksville, Tennessee, at 2056.
At 1050, on November 3, 1993, a man who identified himself as the pilot of N132MP, called the 
Jackson, Tennessee Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) by telephone and obtained a 
preflight weather briefing for a flight from Hohenwald, Tennessee, to Memphis, Tennessee. He 
also obtained an outlook briefing for Nashville, Tennessee. At 1128, he called Data 
Transformation Corporation Direct User Access Terminal System (DUATS), obtained a 
preflight weather briefing from Hohenwald to Memphis, and filed an instrument flight rules 
(IFR) flight plan from Hohenwald, Tennessee to Memphis (MEM). Following a flight from 
Hohenwald to Memphis, a man who identified himself as the pilot of N132MP, called the 
Jackson AFSS by telephone, and filed an IFR flight plan from Memphis to Clarksville, 
Tennessee (CKV). At 1617, the pilot of N132MP reported the Clarksville Airport in sight and 
cancelled his IFR flight plan. At 2056, he contacted Campbell Army Radar Approach Control 
(RAPCON) by radio, indicated that he had departed Clarksville, and was visual flight rules 
(VFR) southbound. At that time, N132MP was radar identified. At 2108, Campbell RAPCON 
terminated radar services for N132MP and advised the pilot of the radio frequency for 
Memphis Approach Control. No subsequent communications from N132MP were recorded 
prior to the accident. There was no record of a weather briefing for N132MP after the DUATS 
briefing at 1128 that morning.
Radar data obtained from Memphis Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) indicated that 
N132MP continued to the south toward Hohenwald. The last radar signature for N132MP 
occurred at 2128, about 3,500 feet mean sea level (msl).
Two local residents were outside at the time of the accident. They reported that a loud "boom" 
noise was heard, followed by a bright light. One of the witnesses recalled hearing the engine 
running prior to the accident. 
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
     Information on the pilot, Mr. William L. Hardison, is included in this report at the section 
titled "First Pilot Information."  The pilot's logbook was partially destroyed by fire, therefore 
his flight time information was obtained from his latest FAA rating application, dated 
September 16, 1992.
     On September 19, 1992, Mr. Hardison failed the flight portion of his examination for an 
instrument rating (airplane). The examiner, Mr. Richard Battle, reported that the examination 
flight was terminated early due to poor performance by  Mr. Hardison. Mr. Battle stated that 
Mr. Hardison "couldn't do anything right," that he could not hold altitude, heading, and 
basically could not remain oriented. He felt that Mr. Hardison was "stretching his physical 
abilities."  Mr. Hardison seemed tired, and could not "settle down". No instrument approaches 
were flown, and the flight was terminated early. Mr. Battle failed him on the flight check, and 
Page 4 of 8ATL94FA012
recommended four hours of additional instruction. Mr. Hardison completed the recommended 
training with another instructor who was working for Mr. Battle, and the flight check was 
rescheduled with Mr. Battle. On October 1, 1992, the flight check was completed. Mr. Battle 
recalled that on this attempt, Mr. Hardison performed very well, with almost no trouble at all. 
He stated that the weather was good on the day of the re- examination, and a complete 
instrument flight profile was flown. Mr. Battle reported that both flight checks were performed 
in the Mooney, N132MP.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
     Information on the aircraft is included in this report at the section titled "Aircraft 
Information."
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
     Weather information for Maury County, Tennessee (MRC), is included in this report at the 
section titled "Weather Information". There was no weather reporting facility at the James A. 
Baker Field. In addition to the observation at Maury County, the observation for Jackson, 
Tennessee (MKL), for 2032  was as follows: Lowest ceiling 500 feet overcast, visibility 3 miles 
in fog, temperature 52 degrees F, dew point 49 degrees F, altimeter 30.12 inches Hg. MKL is 
located about 65 miles west of Hohenwald.
     A local resident was traveling on Highway 20 west in the direction of Hohenwald about 1930 
on the evening of the accident. He stated that the ceilings at the time were very low, and that it 
was a "bad night to fly." He observed a tower located about 5 miles east of Hohenwald (a height 
of 380 feet above ground level), and noted that the top beacon was in fog and rain, and was 
blurred. He drove to the crash site following the accident, and stated that the weather had not 
improved during the evening. 
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
     The aircraft impacted trees and terrain in a densely wooded area, located about 2 miles 
south-southeast of the John A. Baker Field. The wreckage was oriented on a path of about 090 
degrees magnetic, and was approximately 500 feet in length. There was general disintegration 
of the aircraft throughout the wreckage path, with fire damage to several sections, including 
the cockpit area, the aft fuselage, empennage, and wings. The soot patterns on the wing and 
empennage structures were random in appearance, with no evidence of metal spray or leading 
edge to trailing edge soot patterns being observed. All pieces of wreckage found in the first 150 
feet of the wreckage path were free of fire damage and soot. These pieces included several 
fragments of the wing structure and skin, an engine access door, and the number 1 propeller 
blade. There was a freshly cut swath in the trees along the orientation of the initial wreckage 
path, and a measurement of the swath matched an aircraft attitude of 23 degrees left bank, and 
18 degrees nose low. 
     The composite propeller blades were broken at the shanks, with one blade found about 45 
feet to the right of the wreckage path center line, and the other blade found about 150 feet to 
the left of the wreckage path center line. The engine was torn from the firewall, with heavy 
impact damage. The propeller gearbox was separated from the propeller hub; the gearbox was 
crushed and fragmented. All flight controls surfaces were found within the scatter pattern of 
the wreckage; flight control continuity was not confirmed due to damage to the aircraft. 
     The landing gear were separated from the airframe, and the landing gear actuator jackscrew 
Page 5 of 8ATL94FA012
was found in the "gear retracted" position. The flap position could not be determined due to 
impact damage.
     A wreckage distribution diagram is included as an attachment to this report.
MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION
     A post mortem examination of the pilot was performed by  Dr. Julia C. Goodin, M.D., 
Nashville Medical Examiners Office, Nashville, Tennessee. 
     Toxicological testing of the pilot was performed at the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) Civil Aeromedical Institute, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Positive results were observed 
for hydrocodone (a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic), chlorpheniramine (a potent 
antihistamine), dyphenhydramine (an effective antihistamine, also used for its sedative and 
anitemetic effects), salicylate, acetaminophen, ethanol, methanol, and acetaldehyde. During 
blood screening tests, fluoxetine (Prozac) was detected, but it was not confirmed and 
quantitated by a second analytical technique. The NTSB Office of Research and Engineering 
assisted in the investigation of the toxicological aspects of this accident, and their factual report 
is included as an attachment to this report (see Toxicology Factual Report).
     The accident pilot's attending physician, Dr. Stephen L. Averett, prescribed Endal-HD (a 
cough medication containing hydrocodone bitartrate), Valium (a 
tranquilizer/sedative/antianxiety agent), Prozac (an antidepressant), and Vasotec (an 
antihypertensive medication) on various occasions prior to the accident. The dates of the 
prescriptions, as well as pharmacy records obtained by the NTSB, are included in the 
Toxicology Factual Report. Dr. Averett reported that the pilot suffered from allergies and 
depression. Dr. Averett and the accident pilot were co-owners of N132MP, and Dr. Averett (an 
Aviation Medical Examiner, Certificate Number 19194-4) issued the accident pilot's latest FAA 
medical certificate (third class) dated July 23, 1992. 
TESTS AND RESEARCH
The engine was examined at a maintenance facility in Jackson, Tennessee, where the aircraft 
wreckage was stored. The examination was performed under the direction of the NTSB, and 
technical assistance was provided by Porsche, the engine manufacturer. A report of the engine 
examination is included as an attachment to this report.
The propeller assembly was shipped to the manufacturer's facility in Piqua, Ohio, where an 
inspection was performed. The examination was performed under the direction of the NTSB, 
and technical assistance was provided by Hartzell, the propeller manufacturer. A report of the 
engine examination is included as an attachment to this report.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
