Factual Information
 On November 2, 1993, about 1400 eastern standard time, a Waco YMF-5 airplane, N369DP, 
ground looped and came to rest inverted during landing at Valparaiso, Indiana.  The private 
pilot reported no injury.  The airplane was substantially damaged.  Visual meteorological 
conditions existed at the field.  The ferry flight originated in Lansing, Michigan about 1200 
without a flight plan and operated under 14 CFR 91.
The pilot states that prior to entering the traffic pattern to land, he overflew the airport to 
check the wind sock for wind direction and velocity.  He was not able to receive advisories from 
the airport unicom.  The pilot approximated the direction of the wind to be from 190 degrees 
and the velocity 15 to 20 knots.  He elected to land on runway 27.  During the landing roll, the 
pilot states he experienced a strong gust which exceeded the control authority of the airplane.  
The left wing rose, the nose swung left, and the right lower wing tip struck the runway.  The 
airplane then ground looped onto its back.
The pilot reported 5.8 hours flight experience in this type airplane at the time of the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
