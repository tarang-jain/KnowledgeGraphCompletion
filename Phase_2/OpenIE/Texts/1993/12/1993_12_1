Factual Information
 On December 1, 1993, at about 1525 eastern standard time, a Sikorsky H34-G, N8503J, was 
substantially damaged following a collision with terrain near Walterboro, South Carolina. The 
commercial pilot received minor injuries in the accident. The helicopter was being operated 
under 14 CFR Part 133 by Helicopter Lumberjacks of Paragold, Arkansas. Visual 
meteorological conditions existed at the time, and no flight plan had been filed for the local, 
logging operation.
The pilot stated that while at a hover during logging operations, the throttle stuck at a partial 
power setting, and he was forced to execute an emergency landing in the trees. The aircraft was 
substantially damaged during the emergency landing.
Inspection of the throttle linkage to the engine following the accident did not reveal any 
malfunction of the linkage or throttle.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
