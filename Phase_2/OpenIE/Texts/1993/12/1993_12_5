Analysis 
THE SOLO STUDENT PILOT STATES THAT HE CLIMBED THE EXPERIMENTAL, HOME 
BUILT AIRPLANE TO AN ALTITUDE OF 4,200 FEET MSL TO PRACTICE NORMAL SPIN 
ENTRY AND RECOVERY.  OUT OF CURIOSITY, HE APPLIED POWER WHILE IN THE SPIN 
TO SEE IF THE AIRPLANE WOULD SPIN FASTER.  THE AIRPLANE'S NOSE 
IMMEDIATELY ROSE, AND AS THE AIRPLANE ENTERED INTO A FLAT SPIN, THE 
ENGINE LOST POWER.  THE PILOT WAS UNABLE TO RECOVER BEFORE IMPACT WITH 
THE GROUND. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the intentional entry of a stall/spin by the student pilot.

Factual Information
 On December 2, 1993, at 1651 central standard time, a Piel Emeraude CP-304, N7631C, 
sustained substantial damage in a crash at a private airstrip near Warrensburg, Missouri.  The 
solo student pilot received serious injuries.  The local instructional flight originated at the 
private strip where the accident occurred.  No flight plan was filed, and visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed at the time.
In a written statement provided to the NTSB, the pilot states that he had climbed to an altitude 
of 4,200 feet MSL to practice normal spin entry and recovery.  Out of curiosity, he said he 
applied power while in the spin to see if the airplane would spin faster. The airplane's nose 
immediately rose, and as the airplane entered into a flat spin, the engine lost power.  The pilot 
was unable to recover before impact with the ground.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
