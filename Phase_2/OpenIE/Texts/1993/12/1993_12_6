SANTA PAULA, CA
Accident Number:
LAX94LA063

12/02/1993, 1615 PST 
Registration:
N89014
Aircraft:
NORTH AMERICAN SNJ-5
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:

2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that while cruising at 3,800 feet mean sea level he suddenly detected a 'very 
strong smell of aviation gasoline and the engine stopped running.'  The pilot attempted to 
restart the engine, but was not successful. The pilot further reported that he did not have 
sufficient altitude to glide to any airport, so he made an emergency landing in a nearby river 
bed.  During rollout, the airplane collided with vegetation.  An examination of the engine 
revealed it had stopped as a result of being flooded with excessive fuel.  The cause of the 
flooding related to the improper functioning of the carburetor's needle valve pin. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
was the failure of the needle valve pin assembly in the airplane's carburetor.  A factor which 
contributed to the accident was the lack of suitable terrain for the emergency landing.

Factual Information
 On December 2, 1993, at 1615 Pacific standard time, a North American SNJ-5, N89014, 
operated by the pilot, experienced a total loss of engine power during cruise flight at 3,800 feet 
mean sea level.  The pilot made a forced landing in a dry river bed about 2 miles east of Santa 
Paula, California.  During rollout, the airplane collided with vegetation and was substantially 
damaged.  Neither the certificated airline transport pilot nor passenger was injured.  Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local area personal 
flight.  The flight originated from Camarillo, California, on December 2, 1993, at 1545.
The pilot verbally reported to the National Transportation Safety Board that during the flight 
all systems appeared to operate normally, and the fuel and oil pressures were within normal 
operating limits.  Suddenly, he detected a "very strong smell of aviation gasoline and the engine 
stopped running."  The pilot stated that he attempted to restart the engine, but was not 
successful.  The pilot further reported that he did not have sufficient altitude to glide to any 
airport, so he made an emergency landing in a nearby river bed.
At the Safety Board's request, the airplane's carburetor was examined, and a written report was 
received from a Federal Aviation Administration certificated A & P mechanic.  The mechanic 
indicated that the engine stoppage had resulted from it having been flooded with excessive fuel.  
The cause of the flooding related to the improper functioning of the carburetor's needle valve 
pin (see attached report for additional details).
The carburetor was identified by the pilot as follows:   Stromburg, model NAY 9E1; serial No. 
5638362.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
