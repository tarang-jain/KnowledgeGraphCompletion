Factual Information
 On December 1, 1993, about 1538 eastern standard time, a       Cessna 650, N700RR, registered 
to Consolidated International    Services Inc., operating as a 14 CFR Part 91 
executive/corporate    flight, collided with a cement pad while taxiing back to the    taxiway in 
the grass, collapsing the nose gear. Visual      meteorological conditions prevailed and an IFR 
flight plan was      filed. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The       pilot-in-command, 
second officer, and two passengers        were not injured. The flight originated from 
Morristown, New    Jersey, about 2 hours 15 minutes before the accident.      
     The pilot-in-command stated that after landing the airplane    started to weather vane while 
transitioning to a taxiway.       Nosewheel steering was initiated with negative results. Full    
power was applied on the thrust reversers and the airplane      departed the taxiway and came 
to a stop in the grass. FAA       personnel on duty in the control tower asked the pilot if he    
would be able to taxi the airplane back on to the taxiway. The      pilot-in-command evaluated 
the situation and started to taxi    forward. The airplane rolled forward about 10 to 15 feet and 
the    nose gear collapsed. The pilot-in-command exited the airplane,      observed that the 
nosewheel had contacted a cement pad, turned 90   degrees to the left, and the gear had 
collapsed.       
     Examination of the airplane by personnel from Cessna Product   Engineering, and the 
Director of Maintenance, Consolidated      International Services, Inc., revealed the left hand 
main gear      assembly trailing link connectors PW21 and PW23, antiskid       transducers were 
crossed, and responded opposite of how they    should have operated.              
     The accident was initially reported to the NTSB by the FAA     as an incident. As additional 
information was received from     repair personnel, the incident was reclassified as an accident 
on   December 13, 1993.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
