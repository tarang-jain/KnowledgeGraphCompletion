Factual Information
 On April 1, 1993, at about 1330 eastern standard time, a Grob 102, N792G, collided with the 
ground during a forced landing at Kingston, Georgia. The glider was registered to and operated 
by Atlanta Soaring Club, Inc. under 14 CFR Part 91, and visual flight rules. Visual 
meteorological conditions prevailed. A flight plan was not filed for the personal flight. There 
were minor injuries to the private pilot, while the glider was substantially damaged. The flight 
was originating at the time.
During a towed take off, the tow plane's engine lost power. The tow pilot released the glider at 
about 150 feet above the ground. The glider pilot stated that he released the tow rope, then 
turned left to provide room to make a right turn back to the runway. According to the glider 
pilot, during the right turn the "nose fell & I hit the ground." The tow pilot's diagram of the 
airstrip depicted an open field to the east of the runway. He stated that it was his planned 
emergency landing site when the engine lost power.
Subsequently, the tow pilot discovered that the fuel shut-off valve had been partially closed. 
The position of the fuel shut- off valve resulted in a loss of power until the throttle was reduced.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
