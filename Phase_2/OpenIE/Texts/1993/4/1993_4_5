Analysis 
 THE PILOT OF THE WWII VINTAGE MILITARY AIRPLANE EXPERIENCED A COMPLETE 
LOSS OF ENGINE POWER WHILE CLIMBING THROUGH 5,000 FEET. THE 
PRESELECTED FORCED LANDING AREA WAS BEYOND THE GLIDING CAPABILITIES OF 
THE AIRPLANE, SO THE PILOT ELECTED TO LAND STRAIGHT AHEAD IN A ROUGH 
AND UNEVEN FIELD. THE FUSELAGE WAS SEVERED AFT OF THE PILOT'S SEAT AND 
BOTH WINGS AND THE UNDERSIDE OF THE AIRPLANE WERE SEVERELY DAMAGED. 
EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE FAILED TO DISCLOSE ANY ANOMALIES THAT COULD 
HAVE PREVENTED NORMAL ENGINE OPERATION 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER FOR UNDETERMINED REASONS. A FACTOR WAS THE 
LACK OF SUITABLE TERRAIN FOR THE FORCED LANDING

Factual Information
 On April 1, 1993, at approximately 1540 central standard time, a Chance Vought F4U 4 
airplane, N68HP, was substantially damaged during a forced landing following the loss of 
engine power, near Breckenridge, Texas. The commercial pilot, sole occupant of the airplane, 
sustained minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight.
According to the pilot, nearly an hour after his departure, the airplane was climbing through 
5,000 feet, when without warning, the engine loss power. The pilot stated that he selected a 
suitable forced landing area as he established the best glide speed and completed the 
emergency procedures in an attempt to regain power.
The preselected forced landing area was beyond the reach of the airplane, so the pilot elected to 
land straight ahead in an open field. After impacting small trees, the airplane impacted in 
rough and uneven terrain, went through a fence post and a fence, crossed a two lane highway, 
coming to rest on the shoulder of the highway, with the right wing partially blocking the right 
lane.
The fuselage was severed just aft of the pilot's seat. Additionally, the underside of the fuselage 
and both wings were heavily damaged.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
