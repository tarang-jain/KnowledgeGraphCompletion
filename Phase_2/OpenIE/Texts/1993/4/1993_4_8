Analysis 
 AFTER MAKING A DOWNHILL TAKEOFF, AND JUST AFTER PASSING THE END OF THE 
RUNWAY, THE SKI EQUIPPED AIRPLANE DESCENDED AND COLLIDED WITH TREES 
AND A SNOWBANK.  THE RUNWAY WAS COVERED WITH ABOUT 12 INCHES OF 
SLUSHY WET SNOW. THE 57 HOUR PRIVATE PILOT SAID THAT THE AIRPLANES TAIL 
WHEEL (NOT EQUIPPED WITH A SKI) DRAGGING IN THE SNOW KEPT THE AIRPLANE 
FROM GETTING AIRBORNE SOONER.  AFTER HE GOT THE TAIL OUT OF THE SNOW, 
HE ATTEMPTED TO ROTATE BEFORE GAINING SUFFICIENT TAKEOFF AIRSPEED, 
WHICH PUT THE TAIL WHEEL BACK INTO THE SNOW.  THE AIRPLANE GOT AIRBORNE 
ABOUT 3/4 WAY DOWN THE RUNWAY, THEN FLEW IN GROUND EFFECT UNTIL 
PASSING OVER THE END OF THE RUNWAY AND LOWER TERRAIN.  THE PILOT HAD 
JUST RECENTLY PURCHASED THE AIRPLANE, AND FLEW IT (FOR THE FIRST TIME) 
FOR 1.8 HOURS WITH A MORE EXPERIENCED PILOT/FRIEND ON THE PREVIOUS DAY.  
THAT WAS ALSO HIS ONLY TIME AS THE PILOT OF AN AIRPLANE EQUIPPED WITH 
SKIS OR WITH A TAIL WHEEL. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT IN COMMAND'S PREMATURE LIFT-OFF. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE 
THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO ABORT THE TAKEOFF, HIS LACK OF TOTAL EXPEREINCE IN 
THE TYPE AIRPLANE AND TYPE OPERATION, AND THE SLUSH COVERED RUNWAY.

Factual Information
 On April 3, 1993, at 1400 Alaska standard time, a ski equipped Cessna 170 airplane, N4190V, 
crashed during takeoff from the Sky Harbor Private Airport, aka O'Malley Airstrip, Anchorage, 
Alaska.  The private pilot and one passenger were not injured, and the airplane was 
substantially damaged.  The personal flight, operating under 14 CFR Part 91, was destined for 
Kotzebue, Alaska.  Visual meteorological conditions existed, and a VFR flight plan was filed.
Immediately after the accident, during a telephone interview, the pilot said the following in 
part:  "I was taking off downhill to the south.  The runway condition was very slushy with about 
a foot of heavy wet snow on the surface.  The main gear had skis, but the tail gear had a wheel.  
The tail wheel dragging in the snow kept me from getting airborne until I was about 3/4 way 
down the runway.  I got the tail up once, then I tried to rotate too soon and put the tail wheel 
back into the snow, and that slowed me down more.  I should have aborted then, but thought I 
could still get off okay.  I got airborne and was flying in ground effect, but never did get the 
desired takeoff airspeed.  When I reached the end of the runway there was a kind of a drop off.  
I lost ground effect, and the airplane dropped and would not gain altitude.  The airplane then 
collided with some trees and hit a snowbank.  I was close, but not over, the maximum gross 
weight of the airplane."  The pilot and several persons who went to the crash site immediately 
after the accident described substantial damage that was done to both of the airplanes wings.
The pilot stated that he had only about 2 hours as pilot of an airplane equipped with skis.  
Those 2 hours had been while flying the accident airplane with a more experienced pilot/friend 
on the day prior to the accident.  That was also the only time he had flown an airplane with a 
tailwheel.  The pilot had just recently purchased the airplane.  At the time of the accident he  
was starting his flight back home after completion of the airplanes annual inspection on the 
previous day.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
