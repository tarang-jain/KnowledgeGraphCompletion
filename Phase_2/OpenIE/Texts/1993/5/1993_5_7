Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On May 1, 1993, at approximately 0637 central daylight time, a Beech 65-A90, N530N, collided 
with terrain three miles southeast of Mount Ida, Arkansas, Airport.  The airline transport 
certificated pilot and passenger received fatal injuries and the aircraft was destroyed.  
Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed and an IFR flight plan was filed for this 
personal transportation flight to Huntington, Indiana, which departed Mount Ida 
approximately seven minutes prior to the accident.
In an interview with the operator, he stated that the flight was gratuitous and that no payment 
was to be made.  Information provided by friends and family of the passenger indicated that 
this was a paid charter and that they had chartered aircraft from Arkansas Flight Management 
on at least one previous occasion.
Witnesses reported that the aircraft disappeared into the clouds, following takeoff, at 
approximately 200 feet above ground level and that the hills to the southeast were obscured by 
clouds.  They estimated visibility to be 3/4 of a mile in fog.
According to attached air traffic control information, the aircraft made an initial call to 
Memphis Center following takeoff.  This call was answered by the center but no response was 
received.  A review of radar data revealed that the aircraft was not visible on Memphis Center 
radar.  The accident site was approximately 1,100 feet above mean sea level (msl) and the 
highest terrain in the area was approximately 1,400 feet msl.
Wreckage of the aircraft was located by a Arkansas National Guard helicopter later in the day.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
According to information provided by the aircraft owners and the operator, Mr. Theodore C. 
Smith, the pilot of the aircraft was employed by Arkansas Flight Management as a pilot.  Other 
details concerning Mr. Smith's flight experience and qualifications can be found under PILOT 
INFORMATION in this document.
Available information indicates that the pilot arrived at his residence in Hot Springs, around 
midnight the night before the accident.  Based on this investigator's drive from Hot Springs to 
Mount Ida, the driving time between to two points is approximately 45 minutes.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
Wreckage of the aircraft was strewn over an area approximately 150 wide and 750 feet long on 
a base heading of 280 degrees magnetic.  Initial impact damage was observed in trees parallel 
to a ridge line approximately at 1,100 feet msl.  The ridge line highest point is 1,400 feet msl.  
The first 100 feet of the wreckage scatter contained paint flakes, an aileron weight, deicer boot, 
propeller spinner, forward engine cowl door, and the right engine nose section.  These items 
exhibited either no fire damage or minimal fire damage.  The next 300 feet of the wreckage 
scatter sustained heavy fire damage and contained major aircraft components, as depicted in 
the attached wreckage diagram.
The last 350 feet of wreckage scatter started with heavy fire damage which decreased with 
distance and contained those portions of the aircraft shown in the attached wreckage diagram.
TESTS AND RESEARCH
Page 3 of 6DEN93FA053
Both wing position lights were recovered from the wreckage intact.  These were sent to the 
National Transportation Safety Board Materials Laboratory for examination.  The report of 
that examination is attached and provides information indicating both lights were powered at 
the time of the accident.  Electrical diagrams indicate that these light are direct current and do 
not require inverter operation to function.
Both engines were examined at the facilities of Arkansas    Airframe, Inc., in Clinton, Arkansas, 
on May 25, 1993. Participants in the examination represented the NTSB, FAA, Beech Aircraft, 
and Pratt & Whitney.  Assistance was supplied by Arkansas Airframe.  A report of the 
examination is attached and provides evidence that both engines were operating at the time of 
impact.  This is based on rotational damage as detailed in the report.  The report discusses a 
power turbine overspeed governor which exhibited an excessively worn drive shaft.  Initial 
information on this component was supplied by a witness who observed this component being 
removed during routine maintenance.
The witness stated that the component was removed, visually examined and then reinstalled on 
the aircraft, with it known that the spline was worn at that time.  
On December 10, 1992, the aircraft was at Combs Gates maintenance facility in Memphis, 
Tennessee, and the pilot, reportedly a Mr. John Watkins, requested that Combs Gates trouble 
shoot an electrical problem.  The maintenance technicians found that one of the inverters was 
inoperative.  The pilot elected not to have repairs made and departed.  No record has been 
found to indicate that the subject inverter problem was dealt with prior to the accident flight.  
According to Beech Aircraft, either of the two inverters will supply power to the electrically 
powered flight instruments, and the minimum equipment list provides information that the 
aircraft may be flown with one inverter inoperative during day visual operations.
The propeller assemblies were examined at the facilities of Hartzell Propeller on August 12, 
1993.  Present during the examination were representatives from the NTSB, Beech Aircraft, 
and Hartzell Propeller.  Assistance was provided by technicians from Hartzell.  No indication of 
mechanical malfunction was discovered.
ADDITIONAL DATA/INFORMATION
The wreckage, except for the propeller assemblies, was released on May 5, 1993, to Mr. Michael 
J. Wilhelms, Commercial Aviation Insurance, 1212 Tara Lane, Saint Charles, Missouri.  The 
propellers were released on October 4, 1993.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
