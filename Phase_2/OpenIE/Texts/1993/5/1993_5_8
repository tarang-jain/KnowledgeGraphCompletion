Factual Information
 On May 1, 1993, at approximately 0830 central daylight time, during  takeoff from a road near 
De Witt, Arkansas, a WSK PZL MIELEC, PZL M 18, N28587, was destroyed when the airplane 
struck a bulldozer and subsequently impacted the terrain and burned. The commercial pilot 
sustained minor injuries. The FAR CFR Part 137 flight was being operated by Bullock Flying 
Service of De Witt, Arkansas. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight.
During a telephone interview conducted by the investigator in charge with the operator and the 
pilot, the facts in this paragraph were stated. The airplane had departed the De Witt Municipal 
Airport, De Witt, Arkansas, at approximately 0800 for seeding of a rice field. The airplane 
subsequently was departing from a road near the rice field. During the takeoff to the north, the 
airplane was approximately twenty feet above the ground and approximately 400 yards beyond 
the road when the pilot started a turn to the northeast. The pilot stated that "during the turn 
the power setting was ok but the airplane started to settle as if in a downdraft." Winds reported 
by the pilot were from the south with gusts to 15 knots. The pilot made a decision to land the 
airplane in the rice field. With the climb attitude of the airplane, the bulldozer was not seen by 
the pilot. As the airplane settled toward the ground, the wing struck the bulldozer and the wing 
separated from the airplane. During the subsequent uncontrolled descent, the main gears 
struck the ground and the airplane nosed over to the inverted position. A post crash fire was 
observed by the pilot as he exited the airplane. The airplane was destroyed by the fire.
The airplane was released to the operator following the investigation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
