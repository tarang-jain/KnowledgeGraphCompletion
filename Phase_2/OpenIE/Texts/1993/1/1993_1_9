Analysis 
 DURING AN IFR FLIGHT AT ABOUT 11,000 FEET MSL, THE AIRPLANE'S ENGINE 
BEGAN TO RUN ROUGH AND THE ENGINE OIL PRESSURE DROPPED TO ZERO.  THE 
PILOT ALSO SAID HE SMELLED SOMETHING THAT WAS BURNING. THE PILOT 
ENTERED A DESCENT AND REQUESTED VECTORS TO THE NEAREST AIRPORT. WHILE 
ON THE VECTOR, THE ENGINE BEGAN TO RUN ROUGHER AND THE BURNING SMELL 
BECAME STRONGER. THE PILOT SHUT DOWN THE ENGINE AND ENTERED A POWER 
OFF FORCED LANDING. HE BROKE OUT OF THE CLOUDS AND DETERMINED THAT HE 
COULD NOT GLIDE TO THE AIRPORT.  HE PERFORMED A LANDING TO THE ONLY 
AVAILABLE AREA.  DURING TOUCHDOWN, THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED WITH POSTS. 
AN FAA SAFETY INSPECTOR EXAMINED THE ENGINE.  HE DETERMINED THAT 1 OF 
THE 4 BOLTS USED TO BOLT THE ENGINE OIL PUMP COVER TO THE CRANKCASE WAS 
MISSING.  A DAMAGED BOLT WAS FOUND IN THE ENGINE'S CAMSHAFT GEAR. THE 
TAB WASHERS USED TO LOCK THE OIL PUMP COVER BOLTS HAD THEIR SINGLE TAB 
BENT DOWNWARD.  THE TAB WASHERS' TWIN TABS ON THE 3 REMAINING BOLTS 
WERE POINTED STRAIGHT OUT.  THEY APPEARED TO HAVE NEVER BEEN BENT INTO 
PLACE AFTER THE BOLTS WERE TIGHTENED.  IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF THE 
WASHERS RESULTED IN ONE BOLT FALLING OFF AND BEING INGESTED THROUGH 
VARIOUS DRIVE GEARS. THE ENGINE WAS OVERHAULED BY THE MANUFACTURER 
515 HOURS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE ENGINE MANUFACTURER FAILING TO PROPERLY INSTALL TAB WASHERS 
DURING OVERHAUL WHICH RESULTED IN ONE BOLT BECOMING LOOSE AND BEING 
INGESTED THROUGH VARIOUS ENGINE GEAR DRIVES.  THE INGESTION AND LOOSE 
OIL PUMP COVER RESULTED IN THE ENGINE RUNNING ROUGH AND A BURNING 
SMELL WHICH CAUSED THE PILOT TO HAVE TO SHUT DOWN THE ENGINE.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
