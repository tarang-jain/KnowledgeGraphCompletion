Analysis 
DURING THE APPROACH, THE 1ST OFFICER (FO) ASKED THE CAPT IF HE WANTED TO 
'...POP THE BOOTS?' TO REMOVE ICE OFF THE WINGS. THE CAPT RESPONDED '...IT'S 
GOING TO THE HANGAR. I'LL RUN'EM ON THE GROUND...' THE FO RETARDED POWER 
OVER THE THRESHOLD & THE SINK RATE INCREASED; THE CAPT OBSERVED 900 
FPM. THE FO APPLIED ADDITIONAL BACK PRESSURE ON THE YOKE, BUT IT WAS 
INADEQUATE TO ARREST THE HIGH SINK RATE. ADDITIONAL BACK PRESSURE WAS 
APPLIED, AND THE STALL HORN SOUNDED FOLLOWED SHORTLY THEREAFTER BY 
THE CAPT STATING 'I GOT IT.' DURING THE HARD LANDING THE RIGHT MAIN 
LANDING GEAR BROKE, THE FUEL TANK RUPTURED, AND THE RIGHT WING REAR 
SPAR BENT UPWARD. APRX 18 HRS AFTER THE ACCIDENT, 3/16 INCH OF RIME MIXED 
WITH CLEAR ICE WAS OBSERVED ON THE LEADING EDGES OF THE WING, HORIZ 
STAB, AND VERT STAB. THE ICE HAD FINGER-LIKE PROTRUSIONS POSITIONED 
VERTICALLY TO THE WING SURFACES. THE COMPANY'S LINE OPS MANUAL DOES NOT 
DISCUSS FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS OR LANDING TECHNIQUES SPECIFIC TO WING 
ICE. NEITHER PILOT HAD RECEIVED COMPANY'S CURRENT CRM TRAINING. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE FIRST OFFICER'S FAILURE TO MAINTAIN A PROPER DESCENT RATE DURING THE 
LANDING, AND THE CAPTAIN'S INADEQUATE SUPERVISION BY NOT TAKING TIMELY 
ACTION TO ENSURE A SAFE LANDING. FACTORS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE 
ACCIDENT WERE: THE COMPANY'S FAILURE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE TRAINING ON 
THE AIRPLANE'S FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS AND/OR HANDLING TECHNIQUES 
UNDER CONDITIONS OF WING ICE CONTAMINATION, THE COMPANY'S FAILURE TO 
ASSURE THAT BOTH PILOTS HAD RECEIVED THE CURRENT CREW RESOURCE 
MANAGEMENT (CRM) TRAINING, AND THE EXISTING WEATHER CONDITIONS WHICH 
RESULTED IN AN ACCUMULATION OF ICE ON THE AIRPLANE'S WING.

NTSB accident and incident dockets serve as permanent archival information for the NTSB™s 
investigations. Dockets released prior to June 1, 2009 are publicly available from the NTSB™s

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
