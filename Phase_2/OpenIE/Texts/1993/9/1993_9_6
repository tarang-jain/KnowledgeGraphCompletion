Factual Information
 On Thursday, September 2, 1993, at 1000 eastern daylight time, N31858, a Piper PA-34-200T, 
owned by W M T Inc. of Williamson, West Virginia, and piloted by James Klepper of Abingdon, 
Virginia, was destroyed by fire at Williamson Mingo County Airport, Williamson, West 
Virginia.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a flight plan was not filed.  The 
certificated airline transport pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured.  The personal flight was 
conducted under 14 CFR 91 and the intended destination was Abingdon, Virginia.
According to the pilot, just after takeoff, "I began smelling a hot smell.  Within 30 seconds to 1 
minute I started to see smoke in the cockpit.  After going through and completing the 
emergency check list and turning off all electrical including master switch, I elected to return 
for a landing...I was able to taxi the aircraft off of the runway onto the taxiway...after exiting 
the aircraft I called the operator for assistance."  The fire had spread throughout the airplane 
destroying it.  An examination of the airplane after the accident did not reveal the source of the 
fire.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
