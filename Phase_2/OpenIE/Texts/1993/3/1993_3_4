Analysis 
THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE EXECUTED THE ILS APPROACH TO RUNWAY 35.  THE 
RUNWAY WAS 6499 FEET LONG AND 150 FEET WIDE. HE SAID HE DESCENDED TO 
ABOUT 550 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND ON HIS APPROACH AND SAW THE RUNWAY 
LIGHTS.  HE STATED THAT DURING THE LANDING ROLL, HE LOST SIGHT OF THE 
RUNWAY LIGHTS DUE TO FOG.  ACCORDING TO THE FAA, IT WAS A DARK NIGHT 
WITH LOW LEVEL FOG AND HAZE.  MOST OF THE RUNWAY HAD BEEN CLEARED, BUT 
SNOW REMAINED NEAR THE EDGES.  THE LEFT SIDE WAS COVERED WITH SNOW 
FROM ABOUT 6 TO 14 FEET FROM THE LEFT EDGE.  THE AIRPLANE ENCOUNTERED 
SNOW ON THE LEFT SIDE, WHERE SNOW ON AND ADJACENT TO THE RUNWAY WAS 
ABOUT 12 FEET WIDE.  APPROACHING THE INTERSECTION WITH RUNWAY 5/23, 
THERE WAS A SNOWBANK ON THE LEFT EDGE THAT OBSCURED THE RUNWAY 
LIGHTS.  AT THE INTERSECTION, THE SNOWBANK ROSE TO ABOUT 6 FEET TALL AND 
EXTENDED ABOUT 12 FEET ONTO THE RUNWAY 35.  THE LEFT NACELLE STRUCK THE 
SNOWBANK, WHICH SPUN THE AIRCRAFT AND SHEARED OFF THE LANDING GEAR. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
FAILURE OF AIRPORT PERSONNEL TO REPORT THE RUNWAY CONDITION BY NOTAM 
WHEN AIRPORT SNOW REMOVAL PERSONNEL LEFT SNOW PILED ON THE EDGES OF 
THE RUNWAY.  FACTORS RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE: DARK NIGHT, FOG, AND 
THE SNOWBANK.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
