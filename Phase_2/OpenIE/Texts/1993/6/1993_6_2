Analysis 
ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, WHILE ON APPROACH  TO THE DIMLY LIGHTED 
RUNWAY, HE DISCOVERED  THAT THE AIRCRAFT LANDING  LIGHT WOULD NOT

LANDING LIGHT STILL FAILED TO OPERATE.  THE PILOT ELECTED TO CONTINUE THE 
APPROACH TO A LIGHTED AREA ON THE AIRPORT.  THE AIRPLANE TOUCHED DOWN

DEPRESSION IN THE GRASSY AREA.

THE PILOT'S FAILURE TO ESTABLISH A FINAL  APPROACH COURSE TO THE RUNWAY 
SURFACE  DURING A NIGHT LANDING. A FACTOR WAS THE INOPERATIVE AIRCRAFT 
LANDING LIGHT.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
