Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On August 1, 1993, at 1200 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Bellanca 7GCBC airplane, 
N68578, landed short of the approach end of the runway, then nosed over at Soldotna, Alaska.  
The private pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured.  The airplane was substantially damaged.  
The personal local flight, operating under 14 CFR Part 91, had departed from the Soldotna 
Airport about 15 minutes prior to the accident.  Visual meteorological conditions existed, and 
no flight plan was filed.
Shortly after the accident the pilot stated that one of the airplane's brakes locked up while 
performing a post maintenance high speed taxi.  One witness, Mr. Richard Reed, stated that 
the airplane nosed over after it touched down short of the runway during landing.  Several 
other persons reportedly witnessed the accident but would not identify themselves.  Officer 
John Gregory from the Soldotna Police Department, stated that he found ground scars that 
indicated that the airplane touched down short of the runway.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Following the accident FAA Inspector David S. McGlothlen, FSDO-03, Anchorage, Alaska, 
interviewed the pilot, Mr. Theodore A. Smith.  At that time the pilot stated that the accident 
occurred while he was practicing short field landings.  On NTSB Form 6120.1/2 (Accident 
Report), the pilot reported that he was practicing aborted takeoffs on short fields, and applied 
the brakes too "aggressively".

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
