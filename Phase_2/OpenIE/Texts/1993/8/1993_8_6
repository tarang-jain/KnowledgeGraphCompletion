Factual Information
 HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On August 1, 1993, at 1418 central daylight time, a Grumman G-58A, N3025, registered to and 
operated by Elmer F. Ward, a private pilot of Santa Ana, California, experienced a loss of power 
on takeoff from runway 18 (8,001' x 150' dry/concrete) at the Wittman Regional Airport, 
Oshkosh, Wisconsin.  A forced landing was made in an open field one-half mile south of the 
airport.  On touchdown the airplane impacted the terrain and sustained substantial damage.  
The pilot received serious injuries.  The personal flight was being conducted under the 
provisions of 14 CFR Part 91, in visual meteorological conditions.  The flight was being 
conducted in conjunction with the annual Experimental Aircraft Association's convention.  No 
flight plan was on file.  The local flight was originating at the time of the accident.
The pilot stated that shortly after takeoff (altitude of 75 to 100 feet above ground level) the 
engine lost power and did not respond to control inputs.  He stated that he could not account 
for the midrange location of the mixture control as found at the accident site.
He stated that he left the gear extended and lowered the flaps to full down.  He indicated that 
the airplane impacted the ground in a full stall condition, right wing low, and cartwheeled 
clockwise on the nose and left wing.
There were no actual witnesses other than the pilot to the impact, although several witnesses 
saw the aircraft descending.  Their view of the impact was out of their line of sight due a 
depression in the terrain to the south of the airport, where the accident occurred.  One witness 
near the runway when the airplane departed, stated that the engine sounded as if it was 
running strong; however, about the time it passed in front of him from north to south, it 
backfired one time and the engine sound diminished.  He watched the airplane descend out of 
sight, to the south, just prior to impact.  He did not hear the engine noise increase during that 
time, although he believed that it did continue to run at a lower power setting until impact.
PERSONAL INFORMATION
The pilot born May 6, 1921, held a private pilot certificate with an instrument rating for 
airplanes.  He had accumulated 2,256 hours total time at the time of the accident with 56 hours 
in this make and model of airplane.  He was the holder of a third class medical certificate 
issued April 3, 1992, with the vision restriction for wearing lenses for near vision.  His last 
biennial flight review was on March 26, 1992. 
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
The airplane was a Grumman G58A, N3025, serial number 739A.  Total airframe time is 
unknown.  The airplane and engine had accumulated 78 hours time in service since overhaul.  
The last annual inspection was performed on July 14, 1993.
WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION
The airplane impacted the terrain approximately one-half mile off the departure end of runway 
18 at Wittman Regional Airport at Oshkosh, Wisconsin.  The impact occurred an open field of 
tall grass, which slopped slightly downhill to the south, in the direction of travel.
The airplane was configured as the pilot indicated with the landing gear and flaps in the 
extended position.  During the impact the landing gear collapsed and was torn from the 
Page 4 of 6CHI93FA296
airframe.
The pilot stated that the airplane cartwheeled clockwise on the main landing gear and the right 
wing, followed by the engine and left wing.  Ground scars confirm that the impact was as 
described by the pilot.  Wing and landing gear parts were found along the debris trail and 
within the ground scars left by the impact.
The airplane was examined at the accident site minutes after the accident.  At the arrival of 
inspectors, the pilot was trapped inside the airplane, and rescuers had difficulty in opening the 
canopy to remove the pilot.  During this time the pilot was unconscious and not moving.
Immediately after the pilot was freed from the airplane, an examination of the cockpit was 
conducted.  Switches and controls were in the "as found" condition.  The throttle was full 
forward.  The mixture and propeller controls were approximately midrange.  The mixture 
control was near the idle cutoff position.
The airplane was removed from the accident site and returned to the airport for a thorough 
examination.  Flight and engine control continuity was confirmed.  The engine controls had full 
travel.  An examination of the engine failed to reveal any anomalies when examined.  Fuel was 
found in the carburetor, lines and tank.  Filters were clean.  Engine rotation was checked and 
valve and accessory rotation was observed.  Several spark plugs were removed and found to 
have combustion deposits on the electrodes.  Oil was examined and found to be free of foreign 
material and the oil filter was clean.  
ADDITIONAL DATA/INFORMATION
Party to the investigation was the Federal Aviation Administration, Flight Standards District 
Office, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
The NTSB did not retain possession of the wreckage beyond the examination, which took place 
immediately after the accident.  The airplane's location was known to the pilot's family at the 
time the NTSB departed the accident scene and they assumed responsibility for it.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
