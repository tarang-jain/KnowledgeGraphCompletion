The collapse of the nosegear precipitated by the failure of the hydraulic nosegear drag strut 
locking actuator.

Factual Information
 On August 2, 1996, about 1100 Alaska daylight time, a deHavilland DHC-4 airplane, N800NC, 
registered to and operated by Greatland Air Cargo, sustained substantial damage while landing 
at the New Stuyahok airstrip, New Stuyahok, Alaska. The commercial certificated captain and 
first officer were not injured. The 14 CFR Part 135 cargo flight operated in visual 
meteorological conditions.
During a telephone interview with the NTSB investigator-in-charge on August 5, the captain 
related that during the landing roll at New Stuyahok, the nose gear suddenly collapsed. The 
captain said the landing was normal and uneventful until the nosegear collapsed. He also said 
that the green, gear down and locked light, was appropriately illuminated, and that he was 
uncertain why the nosegear collapsed.
The airplane was returned to its maintenance base and repaired.  According to the pilot, the 
nose gear hydraulic drag strut actuator malfunctioned, and failed to remain in the down locked 
position.  He said the part was changed, and the nosegear operated properly.  He also indicated 
that the drag strut actuator service life is "on condition."  The failed part, part number 5460-3, 
had approximately 1400 service hours at the time of failure.  The pilot, who is also a 
certificated aviation mechanic, believes that additional inspections of the drag strut and 
associated hoses are warranted.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
