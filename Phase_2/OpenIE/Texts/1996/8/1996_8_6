Factual Information
 On August 2, 1996, about 1349 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Cessna 185 airplane, 
N20752, owned and operated by Cape Smythe Air Service, sustained substantial damage while 
landing at Point Franklin, located about 25 miles northeast of  Wainwright, Alaska. The solo 
airline transport certificated pilot was not injured.  The 14 CFR Part 135 cargo flight operated 
in visual meteorological conditions.  The flight originated at Barrow, Alaska, about 1300.
According to a written statement issued by the pilot, she said she was landing on hard sand in 
light and variable wind conditions. The airplane bounced on landing, and touched down again 
in a tail low attitude. She then applied the brakes because she was concerned about the water 
in front of her. The tail of the airplane rose, and the airplane nosed over onto the sandy landing 
surface.
The Director of Operations for the operator described the landing area as a section of leveled 
beach situated behind sand dunes.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
