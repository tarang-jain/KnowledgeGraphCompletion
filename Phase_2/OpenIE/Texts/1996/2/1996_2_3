Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
LAKEVIEW, OR
Accident Number:
SEA96TA046
Date & Time:
02/01/1996, 1615 PST 
Registration:
N2866B
Aircraft:
Christen Industries A-1
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor, 1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Public Aircraft
Analysis 
The aircraft was being used on an animal control flight, and the pilot was executing a low pass 
over a frozen, flat, snow covered lake surface, in pursuit of a coyote. During this maneuver, the 
gunner's weapon jammed, and the pilot diverted his attention to the direction of the weapon's 
muzzle, which was pointed toward a fuel tank. Immediately thereafter, the aircraft's wheels 
drug in the snow covered surface, and the aircraft nosed over. An overcast existed at the time, 
and there was a lack of references available on the smooth, even surface of the lake to enhance 
the pilot's depth perception. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
failure of the pilot to maintain altitude/clearance from the terrain (snow covered, frozen lake).  
Factors relating to the accident were: the pilot's attention being diverted to a perceived safety 
hazard, and lack of visual cues for pilot perception of clearance from the lake surface. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: IN FLIGHT COLLISION WITH TERRAIN/WATER
Phase of Operation: MANEUVERING
Findings
1. TERRAIN CONDITION - SNOW COVERED
2. (C) ALTITUDE/CLEARANCE - NOT MAINTAINED - PILOT IN COMMAND
3. (F) DIVERTED ATTENTION - PILOT IN COMMAND
4. (F) VISUAL/AURAL PERCEPTION - PILOT IN COMMAND

Factual Information
 On February 1, 1996, approximately 1615 Pacific standard time, a Christen Industries, Inc., A-
1, N2866B, operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on an exclusive use lease, was 
substantially damaged during a collision with terrain while maneuvering. The certificated 
commercial pilot sustained minor injuries and the passenger was uninjured. The accident 
occurred on the frozen, snow covered surface of Goose Lake, approximately five miles 
southeast of the Lakeview Airport, Lakeview, Oregon. The flight, which was to be operated for 
the purposes of animal control, was public in nature. Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and no flight plan had been filed. The aircraft had originated from Lakeview 
approximately 1400 hours and was on a local flight.
In an interview, the pilot reported that while executing a low pass in the vicinity of a coyote the 
gunner's weapon jammed. The pilot, concerned as to the direction in which the weapon was 
aimed (towards a fuel tank), shifted his attention to the gun barrel to move it away from critical 
aircraft areas. During this event the aircraft's main gear touched down on the snow covered 
lake surface. Tracks from the wheels indicated a ground roll of approximately 30 feet before 
the aircraft nosed over.
There were no references on the surface of the lake, e.g., fence posts, trees, brush, rocks to 
provide the pilot with depth perception cues. An overcast existed which filtered the late 
afternoon sunlight reducing surface shadow effects, and the sun angle was low at the time of 
the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
