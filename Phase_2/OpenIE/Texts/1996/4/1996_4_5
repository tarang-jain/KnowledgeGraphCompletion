Analysis 
The pilot reported that while taxiing before takeoff, the airplane encountered a strong gust of

departing to the east from a two lane county road with loose gravel that ran east and west. The 
winds were reported to be 10 to 15 miles per hour from the south-southeast. The airplane came 
to rest in a ditch on the north side of the road.

Factual Information
 On April 1, 1996, at 0830 central standard time, a Cessna 206, N6237Q, sustained substantial 
damage while taxiing on a gravel county road when a gust of wind flipped the airplane on its

miles east of Ulysses, Kansas, en route to Liberal, Kansas.  Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed and no flight plan was filed.
The pilot reported that while taxiing just prior to takeoff roll, a very strong gust of wind struck 
the airplane, causing it to slide sideways.  He reported that when the airplane reached the left

The pilot reported that he was departing to the east from a two lane gravel county road that ran 
east to west.  He reported that the winds were 10 to 15 miles per hour from the south, 
southeast.
The winds in Garden City, Kansas, 30 miles to the northeast were reported as 170 degrees with

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
