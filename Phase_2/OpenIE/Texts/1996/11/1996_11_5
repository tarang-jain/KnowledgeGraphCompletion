Location:
SUPAI, AZ
Accident Number:
LAX97LA030
Date & Time:
11/01/1996, 1230 MST 
Registration:
N90144
Aircraft:
Bell 206B
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 133: Rotorcraft Ext. Load
Analysis 
The helicopter was was being used in an external lift operation, moving supplies of salt to a 
storage location. The pilot reported that he was lifting to a hover over a loaded cargo net, 
unaware that the external load cable was draped over one of the skids. As the cable took the 
strain of the load, the helicopter rolled, and the lateral control limit was exceeded. The pilot 
released the load with an electrical switch; however, before control was regained, the helicopter 
contacted the ground, nose low, and the main rotor blades struck the ground. The pilot 
reported that from initial down-force on the skid until impact, the time frame was less than 4 
seconds. He also reported no mechanical malfunction with the helicopter. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
improper routing of the external cargo hoist cable (over helicopter skid), which resulted in 
lateral imbalance and roll-over of the helicopter, as weight on the cable became effective.

Factual Information
 On November 1, 1996, at 1230 hours mountain standard time, a Bell 206B helicopter, N90144, 
dynamically rolled over and crashed while lifting an external sling load from an uncharted 
mountainous helipad located near Supai, Arizona.  The helicopter was owned and operated by 
Action Helo of Arizona, under 14 CFR Part 133 for the local flight.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed at the time of the accident and a company VFR flight plan had been filed 
for the operation.  The helicopter was destroyed and property on the ground was damaged in 
the ensuing crash.  The certificated commercial pilot, the sole occupant, sustained minor 
injuries.
In his written accident report, the pilot said that "while lifting to a hover over a cargo net 
external load, the 40 foot cable became fouled over the skid (left-right unknown).  Control 
limits were exceeded with an increasing roll rate.  The load was released by the electrical switch 
but the helicopter contacted the ground nose low striking main rotors to the ground.  From 
initial down-force on [the] skid to impact[, it] was less than perhaps four seconds."  The pilot 
also reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions with the helicopter.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
