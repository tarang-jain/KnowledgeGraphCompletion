Analysis 
The pilot and two passengers were departing on a cross-country on-demand charter flight. The 
airplane was 120 pounds below maximum gross weight. The pilot departed runway 11, but after 
lift off, the airplane would not climb. The airplane collided with snow covered tundra terrain 
about 1/8 mile from the departure end of the runway. The operator indicated the pilot and a 
mechanic passenger observed the airplane lights flicker on and off, and smelled an odor of 
overheated electrical wiring. An inspection of the airplane by the FAA did not reveal any 
mechanical malfunction. The wind conditions at the airport, from just before and just after the 
accident, varied from 300 to 312 degrees at 9 knots. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's improper planning/decision, and resultant failure to obtain/maintain sufficient 
airspeed during takeoff.  A factor related the accident was: taking off with a tailwind.

 On December 4, 1996, at 0954 Alaska standard time, a wheel equipped Cessna 172M, N20024, 
collided with terrain during takeoff from the Bethel Airport, Bethel, Alaska.  The airplane was 
being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country on-demand passenger flight to 
Napaskiak, Alaska, under Title 14 CFR Part 135 when the accident occurred.  The airplane,

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
