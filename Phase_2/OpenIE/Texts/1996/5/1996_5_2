8:50 size tires.

Factual Information
 On May 1, 1996, at 1200 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Cessna 170 airplane, 
N1828C, registered to and operated by the pilot, lost a tire while taxiing after landing and 
dragged a wingtip at the Dillingham Airport, Dillingham, Alaska.  The business flight, 
operating under 14 CFR Part 91 for the purpose of fish spotting, departed Togiak, Alaska, and 
the destination was Dillingham.  No flight plan was filed and visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed.  The certificated commercial pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured and the 
airplane received substantial damage.
During a telephone conversation with the pilot on May 4, 1996, he stated that after 
landing, while taxiing to the ramp and applying the brakes, the tire rotated on the rim and 
sheared off the valve stem.  The tire and rim then separated from the landing gear and the 
wingtip dragged the ground. 
According to the NTSB form 6120.1/2, submitted by the pilot, he stated that the bonding 
failed and the rim separated.  He did not submit the rim for examination.  The airplane was 
equipped with 8:50 size tires.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
