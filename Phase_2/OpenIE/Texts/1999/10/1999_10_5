Accident Number:
FTW00LA002
Date & Time:

Registration:
N2157S
Aircraft:
Cessna 210L
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot stated that he was cleared to land.  He extended the landing gear on 1/2 mile final, 
and he 'heard the gear lock into position.'  He added that he then visually checked to see that 
the gear was extended and confirmed this by noting the illuminated green light in the cockpit.  
Upon touchdown, a noise was heard, and the right main landing gear collapsed.  The airplane 
exited the runway surface and came to rest in a grassy area.  Examination of the landing gear 
system revealed that the right main gear down lock switch failed in the 'closed' or 'down locked' 
position. Furthermore, 'dried paint stripper and paint' were observed around the plunger 
portion of the switch, which prevented the plunger from extending. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The cause of the right main gear collapse was undetermined.  A factor was the failure of the 
gear 'down & locked' switch resulting in a false 'down & locked' indication in the cockpit. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: MAIN GEAR COLLAPSED
Phase of Operation: LANDING - FLARE/TOUCHDOWN
Findings
1. (C) REASON FOR OCCURRENCE UNDETERMINED
2. (F) LANDING GEAR,GEAR SWITCH - FAILURE

Factual Information
 On October 1, 1999, at 1530 central daylight time, a Cessna 210L airplane, N2157S, was 
substantially damaged when the right main gear collapsed upon landing at the Northwest 
Arkansas Regional Airport, near Fayetteville, Arkansas.  The non-instrument rated private 
pilot and his passenger were not injured.  The airplane was registered to and operated by the 
pilot.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 
personal flight and a flight plan was not filed.  The cross-country flight originated from the 
Sally Wofford Airport, Weiner, Arkansas, at 1300.
According to the pilot, when the airplane was 5 miles from the destination airport in 
Fayetteville, he was cleared to land on runway 16.  He extended the landing gear while on a 1/2 
mile final.  He "heard the gear lock into position," and then visually confirmed that the landing 
gear had extended.  Furthermore, the green light in the cockpit illuminated, confirming that 
the gear was extended.  Upon touchdown, a noise was heard, and the passenger stated, "I think 
we had a blowout."  The right wing tip contacted the pavement, and the airplane exited the 
runway surface to the right of the runway centerline.  The airplane came to rest upright in a 
grassy area adjacent to the runway. 
Examination of the airplane, by an FAA certified mechanic revealed that the right horizontal 
stabilizer and elevator were "severely bent in an upward direction."  The outboard leading edge 
skin and two nose ribs of the right wing were structurally damaged.  Additionally, the tail tie 
down ring and two antennas mounted on the belly were damaged.  The mechanic stated that 
the right main gear down lock switch (Cessna part number S1377-1) failed in the "closed" or 
"down locked" position. "Dried paint stripper and paint" were observed around the plunger 
portion of the switch, which prevented the plunger from extending.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
