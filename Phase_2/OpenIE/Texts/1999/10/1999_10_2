Analysis 
N300SH, a Beech D-45, was destroyed on impact with terrain following a midair collision with 
N5367G, a Beech T-34, during a practice maneuver by the Lima Lima Flying Squadron.  Both 
aircraft departed in sequence from 6-ship delta formation to perform a maneuver called a pop 
top break.  The pop top break involved each aircraft to depart from the formation in sequence 
by entering a climbing 180-degree turn to follow the lead aircraft in trail.  The narrow area of 
the human eye's visual field is approximately 10-15 degrees.  A video tape of the accident flight 
shows a delayed entry into the turn by the D-45 relative to the T-34's  entry into the maneuver.  
The pilot of the T-34 stated that he did not see the D-45  prior to the midair collision.  The 
Lima Lima Flying Squadron did not have procedures in place to recover or adjust for 
maneuvers that were not successful.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the visual lookout not obtained by the pilot of the Beech T-34 and the inadequate procedure by 
the Lima Lima Flying Squadron.  The delayed entry into the maneuver by the pilot of the Beech 
D-45 was a contributing factor. 
Findings
Occurrence #1: MIDAIR COLLISION
Phase of Operation: MANEUVERING - TURN TO REVERSE DIRECTION
Findings
1. (F) MANEUVER - DELAYED - PILOT OF OTHER AIRCRAFT
2. (F) PROCEDURE INADEQUATE - OTHER INSTITUTION

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
