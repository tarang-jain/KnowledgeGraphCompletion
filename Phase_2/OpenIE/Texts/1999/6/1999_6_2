On June 1, 1999, at 2350:44 central daylight time,1 American Airlines flight 1420, a McDonnell 
Douglas DC-9-82 (MD-82), N215AA, crashed after it overran the end of runway 4R during 
landing at Little Rock National Airport in Little Rock, Arkansas.  Flight 1420 departed from 
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Texas, about 2240 with 2 flight crewmembers, 4 
flight attendants, and 139 passengers aboard and touched down in Little Rock at 2350:20. 
After departing the end of the runway, the airplane struck several tubes extending outward 
from the left edge of the instrument landing system (ILS) localizer array, located 411 feet 
beyond the end of the runway; passed through a chain link security fence and over a rock 
embankment to a flood plain, located approximately 15 feet below the runway elevation; and 
collided with the structure supporting the runway 22L approach lighting system. The captain 
and 10 passengers were killed; the first officer, the flight attendants, and 105 passengers 
received serious or minor injuries; and 24 passengers were not injured.2 The airplane was 
destroyed by impact forces and a postcrash fire.  Flight 1420 was operating under the 
provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121 on an instrument flight rules (IFR) 
flight plan.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight crew's failure to discontinue the approach when severe thunderstorms and their 
associated hazards to flight operations had moved into the airport area and the crew's failure to 
ensure that the spoilers had extended after touchdown.
Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's (1) impaired performance resulting from 
fatigue and the situational stress associated with the intent to land under the circumstances, 
(2) continuation of the approach to a landing when the company's maximum crosswind 
Page 2 of 10DCA99MA060
component was exceeded, and (3) use of reverse thrust greater than 1.3 engine pressure ratio 
after landing.

History of Flight
On June 1, 1999, about 2350:44 central daylight time,  American Airlines flight 1420, a 
McDonnell Douglas DC-9-82 (MD-82), N215AA, crashed after it overran the end of runway 4R 
during landing at Little Rock National Airport in Little Rock, Arkansas. Flight 1420 departed 
from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Texas, about 2240 with 2 flight crewmembers, 4 
flight attendants, and 139 passengers aboard and touched down in Little Rock about 2350:20. 
After departing the end of the runway, the airplane struck several tubes extending outward 
from the left edge of the instrument landing system (ILS) localizer array, located 411 feet 
beyond the end of the runway; passed through a chain link security fence; went down a rock 
embankment to a flood plain, located approximately 15 feet below the runway elevation; and 
collided with the structure supporting the runway 22L approach lighting system. The captain 
and 10 passengers were killed; the first officer, the flight attendants, and 105 passengers 
received serious or minor injuries; and 24 passengers were not injured.  The airplane was 
destroyed by impact forces and a postcrash fire. Flight 1420 was operating under the 
provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121 on an instrument flight rules (IFR) 
flight plan. 
Flight 1420 was the third and final leg of the first day of a 3-day sequence for the flight crew. 
The flight sequence began at O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois. According to 
American Airlines company records, the captain checked in for the flight at 1038, and the first 
officer checked in at 1018. Flight 1226, from Chicago to Salt Lake City International Airport, 
Utah, departed about 1143 and arrived about 1458 (1358 mountain daylight time). Flight 2080, 
from Salt Lake City to Dallas/Fort Worth, departed about 1647 (1547 mountain daylight time) 
and arrived about 2010, 39 minutes later than scheduled because of an airborne hold during 
the approach resulting from adverse weather in the airport area. The captain was the flying 
pilot for flight 1226, and the first officer was the flying pilot for flight 2080. 
Flight 1420, from Dallas/Fort Worth to Little Rock, was scheduled to depart at 2028 and arrive 
at 2141. However, before its arrival at Dallas/Fort Worth, the flight crew received an aircraft 
communication addressing and reporting system (ACARS)  message indicating a delayed 
departure time of 2100 for flight 1420. After deplaning from flight 2080, the flight crew 
proceeded to the departure gate for flight 1420. The flight crew then received trip paperwork 
for the flight, which included an American Airlines weather advisory for a widely scattered area 
of thunderstorms along the planned route and two National Weather Service (NWS) in-flight 
weather advisories for an area of severe thunderstorms  along the planned route.  
The airplane originally intended to be used for the flight was delayed in its arrival to 
Dallas/Fort Worth because of the adverse weather in the area. After 2100, the first officer 
notified gate agents that flight 1420 would need to depart by 2316 because of American's 
company duty time limitation.  The first officer then telephoned the flight dispatcher to suggest 
that he get another airplane for the flight or cancel it.  Afterward, the accident airplane, 
N215AA, was substituted for flight 1420. The flight's 2240 departure time was 2 hours 12 
minutes later than the scheduled departure time. The captain was the flying pilot, and the first 
officer was the nonflying pilot. 
Page 4 of 10DCA99MA060
About 2254, the flight dispatcher sent the flight crew an ACARS message indicating that the 
weather around Little Rock might be a factor during the arrival. The dispatcher suggested that 
the flight crew expedite the arrival to beat the thunderstorms if possible, and the flight crew 
acknowledged this message. The first officer indicated, in a postaccident interview, that "there 
was no discussion of delaying or diverting the landing" because of the weather. According to 
the predeparture trip paperwork, two alternate airports-Nashville International Airport, 
Tennessee, and Dallas/Fort Worth-were specified as options in case a diversion was needed.
Beginning about 2258, flight 1420 was handled by controllers from the Fort Worth Air Route 
Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). About 2304, the Fort Worth center broadcast NWS 
Convective SIGMET [significant meteorological information] weather advisory 15C for an area 
of severe thunderstorms that included the Little Rock airport area. The cockpit voice recorder 
(CVR) indicated that the flight crew had discussed the weather and the need to expedite the 
approach. About 2325:47, the captain stated, "we got to get over there quick." About 5 seconds 
later, the first officer said, "I don't like that that's lightning," to which the captain replied, "sure 
is." The CVR also indicated that the flight crew had the city of Little Rock and the airport area 
in sight by about 2326:59. 
About 2327, the Fort Worth center cleared the flight to descend to 10,000 feet mean sea level 
(msl) and provided an altimeter setting of 29.86 inches of mercury (Hg). The flight was 
transferred about 2328 to the Memphis ARTCC, which provided the same altimeter setting.  
According to the CVR, the flight crew contacted the Little Rock Air Traffic Control Tower 
(ATCT) about 2334:05. The controller advised the flight crew that a thunderstorm located 
northwest of the airport was moving through the area and that the wind was 280 degrees at 28 
knots gusting to 44 knots. The first officer told the controller that he and the captain could see 
the lightning. The controller told the flight crew to expect an ILS approach to runway 22L.  The 
first officer indicated in a postaccident interview that, during the descent into the terminal 
area, the weather appeared to be about 15 miles away from the airport and that he and the 
captain thought that there was "some time" to make the approach.
 
The CVR indicated that, between about 2336:04 and about 2336:13, the captain and first 
officer discussed American Airlines' crosswind limitation for landing. The captain indicated 
that 30 knots was the crosswind limitation but realized that he had provided the limitation for 
a dry runway. The captain then stated that the wet runway crosswind limitation was 20 knots, 
but the first officer stated that the limitation was 25 knots. In testimony at the Safety Board's 
public hearing on this accident,  the first officer stated that neither he nor the captain checked 
the actual crosswind limitation in American's flight manual. The first officer testified that he 
had taken the manual out but that the captain had signaled him to put the manual away 
because the captain was confident that the crosswind limitation was 20 knots.  
About 2339:00, the controller cleared the flight to descend to an altitude of 3,000 feet msl. The 
controller then asked the flight crew about the weather conditions along the runway 22L final 
approach course, stating his belief that the airplane's weather radar was "a lot better" than the 
weather radar depiction available in the tower. About 2339:12, the first officer stated, "okay, we 
can see the airport from here. We can barely make it out but we should be able to make 
[runway] two two that storm is moving this way like your radar says but it is a little bit farther 
off than you thought." The controller then offered flight 1420 a visual approach to the runway, 
Page 5 of 10DCA99MA060
but the first officer indicated, "at this point, we really can't make it out. We're gonna have to 
stay with you as long as possible."
About 2339:45, the controller notified flight 1420 of a windshear alert,  reporting that the 
centerfield wind was 340 degreesat 10 knots, the north boundary wind was 330 degrees at 25 
knots, and the northwest boundary wind was 010 degrees at 15 knots. The flight crew then 
requested runway 4R so that there would be a headwind, rather than a tailwind, during 
landing. About 2340:20, the controller instructed the flight crew to fly a heading of 250 
degrees for vectors to the runway 4R ILS final approach course. After reaching the assigned 
heading, the airplane was turned away from the airport and clear of the thunderstorm that had 
previously been reported by the controller. The CVR indicated that, between 2340:46 and 
2341:31, the first officer stated the localizer frequency and course, the decision altitude, the 
minimum safe altitude, and a portion of the missed approach procedure for runway 4R. 
Between about 2342:19 and 2342:24, the CVR indicated that the captain asked the first officer, 
"do you have the airport? Is that it right there? I don't see a runway." About 2342:27, the 
controller told the flight crew that the second part of the thunderstorm was apparently moving 
through the area and that the winds were 340 degrees at 16 knots gusting to 34 knots. About 
2342:40, the first officer asked the captain whether he wanted to accept "a short approach" and 
"keep it in tight." The captain answered, "yeah, if you see the runway 'cause I don't quite see it." 
The first officer stated, "yeah, it's right here, see it?" The captain replied, "you just point me in 
the right direction and I'll start slowing down here." About 2342:55, the first officer said, "it's 
going right over the field." About 2342:59, the first officer told the controller, "well we got the 
airport. We're going between clouds. I think it's right off my, uh, three o'clock low, about four 
miles." The controller then offered a visual approach for runway 4R, and the first officer 
accepted. About 2343:11, the controller cleared flight 1420 for a visual approach to runway 4R 
and indicated "if you lose it, need some help, let me know please." 
About 2343:35, the first officer stated, "...you're comin' in. There's the airport." Three seconds 
later, the captain stated, "uh I lost it," to which the first officer replied, "...see it's right there." 
The captain then stated, "I still don't see it...just vector me. I don't know." About 2343:59, the 
controller cleared flight 1420 to land and indicated that the winds were 330 degrees at 21 
knots. About 2344:19, the captain stated, "see we're losing it. I don't think we can maintain 
visual." About 2344:30, the first officer informed the controller that visual contact with the 
airport had been lost because of a cloud between the airplane and the airport. The controller 
then cleared the airplane to fly a heading of 220 degrees for radar vectors for the ILS approach 
to runway 4R and directed the flight to descend to and maintain 2,300 feet msl. About 
2345:47, the first officer told the controller "...we're getting pretty close to this storm, we'll keep 
it tight if we have to." The controller indicated to the flight crew that, "when you join the final, 
you're going to be right at just a little bit outside the marker if that's gonna be okay for ya." The 
captain stated, "that's great," and the first officer told the controller, "that's great with us." 
About 2346:39, the controller advised the flight crew that the airplane was 3 miles from the 
outer marker.  
About 2346:52, the captain stated, "aw, we're goin' right into this." At the same time, the 
controller reported that there was heavy rain at the airport, the automatic terminal information 
service (ATIS) information in effect at the time was no longer current,  the visibility was less 
than 1 mile, and the runway visual range (RVR)  for runway 4R was 3,000 feet. The first officer 
acknowledged this information. About 2347:08, the controller again cleared flight 1420 to land 
Page 6 of 10DCA99MA060
and indicated that the wind was 350 degrees at 30 knots gusting to 45 knots. The first officer 
then read back the wind information as 030 degrees at 45 knots. About 2347:22, the captain 
stated, "three thousand RVR. We can't land on that." Four seconds later, the first officer 
indicated that the RVR for runway 4R was 2,400 feet, and the captain then said, "okay, fine."  
About 2347:44, the captain stated, "landing gear down," and the CVR recorded a sound 
consistent with the landing gear being operated. About 5 seconds later, the captain stated, "and 
lights please." About 2347:53, the controller issued a second windshear alert for the airport, 
reporting that the centerfield wind was 350 degrees at 32 knots gusting to 45 knots, the north 
boundary wind was 310 degrees at 29 knots, and the northeast boundary wind was 320 degrees 
at 32 knots. This transmission was not acknowledged by the flight crew. About 2348:10, the 
captain stated, "add twenty [knots]," to which the first officer replied, "right." 
About 2348:12, the controller reported that the runway 4R RVR was now 1,600 feet. About 
2348:18, the captain indicated that the flight was established on final approach;  6 seconds 
later, the first officer informed the controller that the flight was established on the inbound 
portion of the ILS. The controller repeated the clearance to land; stated that the wind was 340 
degrees at 31 knots, the north boundary wind was 300 degrees at 26 knots, and the northeast 
boundary wind was 320 degrees at 25 knots; and repeated the RVR. About 2348:41, the first 
officer acknowledged this information. The controller did not receive any further transmissions 
from flight 1420. About 2349:02, the first officer asked the captain, "want 40 flaps?" The 
captain indicated that he thought he had already called for the landing flaps, after which the 
first officer stated, "forty now." About 2349:10, the controller informed the flight crew that the 
wind was 330 degrees at 28 knots. Two seconds later, the captain stated, "this is a can of 
worms."
According to the CVR, the first officer stated, "there's the runway off to your right, got it?" 
about 2349:24. The captain replied, "no," to which the first officer stated, "I got the runway in 
sight. You're right on course. Stay where you're at." The captain then stated, "I got it. I got it." 
About 2349:32, the controller reported the wind to be 330 degrees at 25 knots. About 2349:37, 
an unidentified voice in the cockpit stated, "wipers," and the CVR then recorded a sound 
consistent with windshield wiper motion. (This sound continued throughout the rest of the 
flight.) About 2349:53, the controller reported the wind to be 320 degrees at 23 knots. 
The CVR indicated that, at 2349:57, an unidentified voice in the cockpit stated, "aw we're off 
course" and that, 1 second later, an unintelligible comment was made by an unidentified voice 
in the cockpit. In a postaccident interview, the first officer stated that he thought the approach 
was stabilized until about 400 feet above field level (afl), at which point the airplane drifted to 
the right. The first officer also stated that he said "go around" about that time but not in a very 
strong voice. The first officer indicated that he had looked at the captain to see if he had heard 
him but that the captain was intent on flying and was doing "a good job."
The CVR indicated that, at 2350:00, the first officer said, "we're way off." Flight data recorder 
(FDR) information indicated that the localizer deviation value was about one dot to the right at 
that point.  About 1 second later, the captain stated, "I can't see it." About 3 seconds afterward, 
the first officer asked, "got it?" to which the captain replied, "yeah, I got it." About 2350:13 and 
:14, the CVR recorded the sound of the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) radio 
altitude callout "sink rate."  Calculations based on FDR data indicated that the airplane was 
descending through an altitude of about 70 feet afl at the time of the first sink rate warning and 
about 50 feet afl at the time of the second warning.  FDR and CVR data indicated that the 
Page 7 of 10DCA99MA060
airplane touched down on the runway about 2350:20. About 2350:22, the first officer stated 
"we're down;" about 2 seconds later, he stated, "we're sliding." FDR data also indicated that, 
over a 7-second period after touchdown, both thrust reversers were deployed and the left and 
right engines' engine pressure ratios (EPR) reached settings of 1.89 and 1.67, respectively.  The 
thrust reversers were subsequently moved to the unlocked status (neither deployed nor 
stowed). According to the FDR, the flight spoilers did not deploy symmetrically at touchdown,  
but a momentary 8° deflection of the left outboard flight spoiler concurrent with a left aileron 
deflection was recorded. 
FDR data indicated that the right and left brake pedals began to move about 2350:25 and :30, 
respectively, and both pedals reached full travel about 2350:31. About the time the brakes were 
applied, the thrust reversers were deployed again. About 2350:32, the CVR recorded an 
unidentified voice in the cockpit stating "on the brakes."  The left engine reached a maximum 
setting of 1.98 reverse EPR, and the right engine reached a setting of 1.64 reverse EPR. The left 
brake pedal was relaxed at 2350:34 before returning to its full position 2 seconds later. About 
the time that the left brake pedal was relaxed, the reversers were returned to the unlocked 
status. As the right thrust reverser was being moved to the unlocked status, the right engine 
reached a maximum setting of 1.74 reverse EPR. 
About 2350:36, FDR data indicated a full 60 degrees deployment of the right inboard flight 
spoiler, concurrent with a full aileron deflection.  About 2350:40, the left thrust reverser was 
moved back to the deployed position, but the right reverser moved briefly to the deployed 
position and then moved to the stowed position. According to FDR data, the left thrust reverser 
remained deployed, and the right thrust reverser remained stowed, for the remainder of the 
flight. About 1 second later, the CVR recorded expletives stated by an unidentified voice in the 
cockpit, which were followed by the sounds of initial impact about 2350:44 and several 
additional impacts beginning about 2350:47. The CVR stopped recording about 2350:48. The 
airplane came to rest about 800 feet from the departure end of runway 4R, 34 degrees 44.18 
minutes north latitude and 92 degrees 11.97 minutes west longitude. The accident occurred 
during the hours of darkness.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
