Analysis 
The instructor pilot was giving the student practice in forced landings when the engine suffered 
a sustained total loss of power.  The instructor attempted to re-start the engine with negative 
results.  He then conducted an actual forced landing in a rough field where the airplane 
sustained substantial damage.  A post accident examination of the engine failed to reveal any 
mechanical anomalies. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the total loss of engine power for reasons undetermined.  Factors were total loss of engine 
power, the instructor pilot's encounter with unsuitable terrain, and the rough terrain.

Factual Information
 On February 2, 1999, at 0900 central standard time, a Cessna 152, N67568, operated by a 
commercial pilot with an instructor rating, and a dual student pilot, sustained substantial 
damage following, a loss of power, and forced landing near Odessa, Missouri.  The instructor 
reported no injuries.  The dual student reported minor injuries.  The instructional flight was 
operating under 14 CFR Part 91, in visual meteorological conditions.  The local flight departed 
Warrensburg, Missouri, about 0800.
In his written statement, the instructor pilot said that he intended to instruct the dual student 
in emergency procedures.  He said that during a simulated loss of power, the engine actually 
did quit and the propeller stopped.  He said that he took over control of the airplane and 
attempted to re-start the engine with negative results.  He then conducted a forced landing 
where on touchdown the nosewheel dug into rough terrain and resulted in substantial damage 
to the airplane.
An examination of the airplane after the accident failed to reveal any mechanical problems 
with the engine.  There was continuity throughout, and the was fuel in the tanks and fuel lines.  
The engine control continuity was verified.  The engine was test run after the accident and 
operated.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
