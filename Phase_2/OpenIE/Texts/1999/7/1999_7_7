Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
BILLINGS, MT
Accident Number:
SEA99LA103
Date & Time:
07/01/1999, 1445 MDT 
Registration:
N3513A
Aircraft:
Piper PA-22
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot reported that upon touchdown the aircraft began to drift left, and right rudder was 
applied to correct with no effect.  As the drift continued, the pilot applied right brake, 
increasing brake pressure until he 'was pushing against the seat.'  The aircraft continued to 
veer left, tightening its turn radius until it had rotated more than 180 degrees counter-
clockwise.  During the rotation, the aircraft settled to the left in line with the runway lights and 
came to a stop.  Post-crash examination by a certified mechanic revealed that the left main 
landing gear shock strut tube had separated at its attach point to the left main wheel assembly.  
This would have allowed the release of the left main landing gear, permitting it to pivot into a 
flat (collapsed) position. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The separation of the left main landing gear shock strut for undetermined reasons.

Factual Information
 On July 1, 1999, approximately 1445 mountain daylight time, a tailwheel equipped Piper PA-
22, N3513A, registered to and being flown by a private pilot, was substantially damaged during 
the collapse of the left main landing gear on landing rollout at the Billings International 
Airport, Billings, Montana.  The pilot and passenger were uninjured.  Visual meteorological 
conditions existed, and no flight plan had been filed.  The flight, which was personal, was to 
have been operated under 14CFR91, and originated from Helena, Montana, at 1234.
The pilot reported that upon touchdown on runway 28R the aircraft began to drift left, and 
right rudder was applied to correct with no effect.  As the drift continued, the pilot applied 
right brake, increasing brake pressure until he "was pushing against the seat."  The aircraft 
continued to veer left, tightening its turn radius until it had rotated more than 180 degrees 
counter-clockwise.  During the rotation, the aircraft settled to the left in line with the runway 
lights and came to a stop.  The pilot and passenger exited and noted the left main landing gear 
separated from its bungee (shock strut,) but still attached to the airframe.
Post-crash examination by an IA certified mechanic revealed that the left main landing gear 
shock strut tube had separated at its attach point to the left main wheel assembly (refer to 
DIAGRAM I).  This would have allowed the release of the left main landing gear, permitting it 
to pivot into a flat (collapsed) position.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
