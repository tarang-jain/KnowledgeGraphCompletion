aircraft struck hangars and was substantially damaged. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to maintain airspeed, and adequately compensate for torque and P-factor, 
resulting in the loss of directional control, collision with hangars, and substantial damage to 
the aircraft during the attempted go around/recovery from a landing.

Factual Information
 On August 1, 1999, about 1026 eastern daylight time, a Mooney M-20R, N9169E, 
registered to a private owner, operated as a 14 CFR Part 91 personal flight, crashed on landing 
at Rockingham County Shiloh Airport,  Stoneville, North Carolina.  Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed.  The airplane was substantially damaged, but 
there were no injuries.  The flight originated from Moneta, Virginia, the same day, about 0930, 
and was proceeding to Greensboro, North Carolina, at the time of the accident.
The pilot stated that he decided to practice landings at Rockingham County Shiloh 
Airport before going on to Greensboro, North Carolina.  The first landing was uneventful, but 
during the second landing, the aircraft bounced twice.  When full power was applied to initiate 
the go around after the second bounce, the pilot stated that he lost directional control and the 
aircraft banked to the left, collided with hangars, and incurred substantial damage.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
