Factual Information
 On August 1, 1999, about 1415 Alaska daylight time, a wheel equipped Cessna 180A airplane, 
N6180, sustained substantial damage while landing at the Gustavus Airport, Gustavus, Alaska.  
The airplane was being operated as a visual flight rules (VFR) personal flight under Title 14, 
CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred.  The certificated commercial pilot, and the one 
passenger aboard, were not injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight 
plan was filed.   
During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-
in-charge on August 2, the pilot reported that he had just landed on runway 28.  He stated that 
the touchdown and the landing roll were uneventful, until the airplane's nose veered slightly to 
the right.  He said he compensated by applying full left rudder, but the airplane suddenly 
ground looped to the right.  During the ground loop the left main landing gear collapsed, and 
the left wing collided with the runway.  The left wing and fuselage sustained substantial 
damage. 
Wind conditions at the time of the accident were reported to be from 190 degrees at 5 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
