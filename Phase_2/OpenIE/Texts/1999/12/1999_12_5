Substantial
Defining Event:

1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
 The student pilot was conducting solo touch and go landings, and on his third landing, as he 
was applying power for the takeoff, the airplane veered left. Despite his application of right 
rudder the airplane continued off the left edge of the runway, collapsing the nose landing gear, 
and striking the terrain with the right wingtip, inducing a left 'cartwheel'. The airplane came to 
rest in the grass on it's nose and left wing, having sustained wing spar and firewall damage. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the takeoff phase of a touch and go 
landing, and the subsequent skid off the runway and collapsed nose landing gear during the 
attempt to abort the takeoff.

Factual Information
 On December 1, 1999, about 1700 eastern standard time, a Cessna 150M, N704YE, 
registered to a private individual, operating as a Title 14 CFR Part 91 instructional flight, 
crashed on landing at Moore-Murrell Airport, Morristown, Tennessee. Visual meteorological 
conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The airplane sustained substantial damage 
and the student pilot, the sole occupant, was not injured. The flight departed the same airport 
about 1 hour before the accident.  
According to the student pilot, after his third touch-and-go landing, he applied power 
for the takeoff and the airplane began a left drift off the runway. Once into the grass, the right 
wing struck the ground, and the airplane "cartwheeled" to the left, coming to rest on the nose 
and left wing.
According to FAA personnel, the pilot stated that when the airplane skidded off the 
runway edge into soft dirt and grass, he elected to abort the takeoff.  Before he got the airplane 
stopped, the nose landing gear collapsed, causing damage to both wing spars and the firewall.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
