Analysis   
The pilot was returning to the departure airport after having flown for approximately two 
hours at various cruise altitudes. The pilot attempted a landing on runway 30 (2,394 feet by 48 
feet), which was slush-covered. During the landing rollout, the airplane "swerved hard right" 
and into a snowbank, where it nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage, which 
included damage to the wing ribs, wing trailing edge, and rudder. A weather reporting station 
about 9 miles from the accident site recorded variable winds at 4 knots at the time of the 
accident. Examination of the airplane revealed that the brake pin lubrication had dried out and 
the right brake caliper would not release.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inability to maintain directional control while landing on a slush-covered runway 
due to inadequate maintenance of the airplane brakes by maintenance personnel.
Findings

Directional control - Not specified (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
