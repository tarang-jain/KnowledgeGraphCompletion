Columbia, MO
Accident Number:
CEN10CA116
Date & Time:
02/04/2010, 1043 CST 
Registration:
N723JP
Aircraft:
PIPER PA-31T
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Landing gear collapse
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that the accident occurred during landing at the destination airport under 
visual weather conditions and light winds. He stated that upon landing, the left main landing 
gear collapsed and the left wing contacted the runway. The airplane subsequently departed the 
runway pavement and came to rest about mid-field in the grass adjacent to the runway. It had 
rotated about 180 degrees and was oriented on an approximately reciprocal heading. The right 
main landing gear also collapsed during the accident sequence. The pilot stated that verifying 
the landing gear indications was normally part of his before-landing procedure; however, he 
could not specifically recall observing three green indications prior to the accident. A 
postaccident examination revealed substantial damage to the lower fuselage in the vicinity of 
the cabin entry door. In addition, the inboard landing gear doors exhibited crushing damage 
consistent with the landing gear being in transit at the time of contact with the runway. The 
inboard landing gear doors open when the gear is in transit and close after the gear extension 
sequence is complete. Recorded winds at the time of the accident were 8 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to verify that the landing gear was fully extended prior to landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
