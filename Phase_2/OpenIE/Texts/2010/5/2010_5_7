Analysis   
The private pilot reported that he was landing the tail wheel-equipped airplane at a privately-
owned grass airstrip with a "slight" crosswind. He reported that after touchdown, during the 
landing roll, he lost directional control of the airplane and it collided with an unoccupied 
parked vehicle adjacent to the runway. The collision resulted in substantial damage to the right 
wing. No mechanical deficiencies or anomalies with the airplane were reported.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the crosswind conditions resulting in the loss of 
directional control while landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
