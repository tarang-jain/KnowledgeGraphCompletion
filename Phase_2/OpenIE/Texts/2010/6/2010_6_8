Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Waterville, WA
Accident Number:
WPR10LA272
Date & Time:
06/01/2010, 1129 PDT 
Registration:
N8815U
Aircraft:
EAGLE Eagle DW-1
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Positioning
Analysis 
The pilot was repositioning the airplane when the engine lost power. He made a forced landing 
in a soft field, and the airplane nosed over. An examination of the wreckage revealed a worn 
wire on one magneto. It is likely that the intermittent grounding of the magneto could have 
caused the engine to surge and lose power.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A worn wire in the magneto system, which allowed intermittent grounding and a loss of engine 
power.
Findings
Aircraft
Ignition system wiring - Fatigue/wear/corrosion (Cause)
Engine (reciprocating) - Failure (Cause)
Environmental issues
Soft surface - Contributed to outcome

Factual Information
On June 1, 2010, about 1129 Pacific daylight time, an Eagle DW-1, N8815U, made an off airport 
forced landing near Waterville, Washington. The owner was operating the airplane under the 
provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The certificated commercial pilot 
was not injured. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the empennage. The cross-
country positioning flight departed Waterville about 1115, with a planned destination of 
Missoula, Montana. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been 
filed.
The pilot was positioning the airplane for export, when he encountered a loss of engine power. 
He made a forced landing in a soft field, and the airplane nosed over.
A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector examined the wreckage. He discovered an 
anomaly with wiring on one magneto. The 'P' lead is a shielded wire with the primary 
grounding wire inside of the insulator which, in turn, is surrounded with a braided shielding 
wire. The shielding wire is always grounded. The inner 'P' wire is grounded at the ignition 
switch when the key is off. In this case the inner 'P' lead and the insulation were broken 
through. The wire was held together by about 1/3 of the shielding wire. As the air and vibration 
moved the wire around, it caused the inner 'P' lead to intermittently come in contact with the 
always grounded shielding wire. In turn, that allowed the magneto to intermittently turn on 
and off, causing the engine to surge and lose power.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
