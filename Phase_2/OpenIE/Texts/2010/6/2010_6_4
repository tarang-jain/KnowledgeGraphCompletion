Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
Following a practice instrument approach, the student pilot and flight instructor intended to 
perform a touch-and-go maneuver. During the landing roll the instructor informed the student 
to retract the airplane™s flaps; however, the student inadvertently moved the landing gear 
retraction/extension handle to the ﬁupﬂ position. Although the instructor moved the landing 
gear handle back to the ﬁdownﬂ position, the airplane™s nose landing gear collapsed. The 
airplane continued down the runway about 240 feet before exiting the right side of the runway 
into the grass. The airplane came to rest in a nose-down position and all three occupants were 
able to exit unassisted. An examination of the airplane by maintenance personnel after the 
accident revealed that the right wing sustained structural damage. There were no reported 
anomalies with the airplane™s landing gear prior to the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot™s inadvertent retraction of the nose landing gear and the flight instructor's 
delayed response.
Findings
Personnel issues
Incorrect action selection - Student pilot (Cause)
Delayed action - Instructor/check pilot (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
