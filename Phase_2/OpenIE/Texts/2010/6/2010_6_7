Registration:
N4399J
Aircraft:
SHAFFER WILLIAM C QUICKSILVER 
MX II SP
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control in flight
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
A witness observed the airplane in a field moving back and forth across a make shift dirt 
landing strip. He then observed the airplane take off and fly in a ﬁcircling maneuverﬂ for 
approximately one hour. The witness stated that the airplane was flying eastbound over the 
makeshift landing strip and he watched as it attempted to land in windy conditions. He 
observed the airplane blown by the wind slightly to the south of the landing strip and crash, 
flipping over an unknown number of times. A police officer noted that this may have been the 
pilot™s first actual flight in this airplane and that at the time of the accident there was ﬁa 
variable wind in the area that did pick up.ﬂ Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that the airplane landed on a soft/rough surface off 
the runway which resulted in the collapse of the right main gear. Further damage to the 
airplane occurred when the pusher propeller cut through a tail support tube of the airplane. 
The pilot did not hold any pilot or medical certificate.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate compensation for the gusty crosswind conditions and failure to maintain 
runway alignment while landing.
Findings
Aircraft
Crosswind correction - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Incorrect action performance - Pilot (Cause)
Environmental issues
Crosswind - Response/compensation (Cause)

Factual Information
On June 1, 2010, about 1320 Pacific daylight time, an experimental Quicksilver MX II SP 
airplane, N4399J, was substantially damaged during landing in a field near Visalia, California. 
The non-certified pilot, the sole occupant of the airplane, was uninjured. The airplane had 
recently been purchased and was operated by the pilot under the provisions of Title 14 Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 91.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was 
filed.
In a witness statement obtained by the Visalia Police Department, the witness observed a 
yellow airplane in a field moving back and forth across a dirt landing strip. He then observed 
the airplane take off and fly in a ﬁcircling maneuverﬂ for approximately one hour. The witness 
stated that the airplane was flying eastbound over the makeshift landing strip and he watched 
as it attempted to land in windy conditions. He observed the airplane blown by the wind 
slightly to the south of the landing strip and crash, flipping over an unknown number of times.
The pilot stated to the Visalia Police Department that he had just purchased the airplane and 
that he had flown this type of airplane in the past. The responding officer indicated in the 
police report that this may have been the pilot™s first actual flight in this airplane. He also 
documented that at the time of the accident there was ﬁa variable wind in the area that did pick 
up.ﬂ The police report documented that one of the landing gear tires made contact with the 
ground approximately 45 feet south of the runway and that the airplane appeared to be 
traveling in a southeasterly direction.
Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed 
that the airplane landed on a soft/rough surface which resulted in the collapse of the right 
main gear. Further damage to the airplane occurred when the pusher propeller cut through a 
tail support tube of the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
