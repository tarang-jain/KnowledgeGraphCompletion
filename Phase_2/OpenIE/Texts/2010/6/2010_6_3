Analysis   
The pilot reported that she was practicing touch-and-go landings when the accident occurred.  
During her first touch-and-go, the airplane bounced after a hard landing.  She attempted to 
correct for the bounced landing, but the airplane™s nose landing gear impacted the runway 
before the main landing gear.  The airplane stabilized onto all three landing gear and she 
proceeded with the next takeoff.  No anomalies were experienced with the two subsequent 
landings.  A postflight inspection of the airframe revealed substantial damage to the engine 
firewall and fuselage floor structure.  The pilot reported that there were no preimpact 
mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the 
airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare and recovery from a bounced landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
