Analysis   
The pilot reported that shortly after takeoff, he turned to his intended heading and climbed to a 
predetermined cruise altitude to maintain clearance from terrain during the night visual flight 
rules cross-country flight.  Following an uneventful cruise phase of the flight, the pilot observed 
what he believed to be his destination airport and initiated a descent.  The pilot stated that he 
was unable to turn on the airport runway lights and decided to continue the descent to the 
airport's traffic pattern altitude of 4,500 feet mean sea level (msl) while circling the airport.  
During the second circle and descent, the pilot aborted the descent and began to initiate a 
climb whereupon the airplane impacted terrain at an elevation of about 5,200 feet msl.  The 
pilot reported that he was surprised when local law enforcement informed him that he was in 
Seligman, Arizona, instead of his intended destination of Boulder City, Nevada.  The pilot 
reported that there were no pre-impact anomalies with the airplane that would have 
contributed to the accident and that "all systems were working."  The pilot added that prior to 
the flight; he estimated an approximate heading and altitude needed for the flight to his 
destination airport.

Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=77724
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
