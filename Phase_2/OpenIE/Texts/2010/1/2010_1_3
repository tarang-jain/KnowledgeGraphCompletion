Analysis   
While maneuvering at low level over a field during an aerial application flight, the helicopter 
pilot took his hand off the collective to adjust the sun visor because the sun was in his eyes. The 
pilot reported that he had used his leg to block the collective from moving as he adjusted the 
visor. The helicopter hit mild turbulence and bumped his leg away from the collective. The 
collective slipped down, and the helicopter impacted the ground and rolled over on its side. 
The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the tailboom and cockpit.  The pilot stated that 
there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the helicopter's flight control system or 
engine prior to the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
