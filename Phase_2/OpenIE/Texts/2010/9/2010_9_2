BEECH D35
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of engine power (total)

1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that he departed on a cross-country flight with 49 gallons of fuel on-board 
the airplane. About 3 hours later, as he approached his destination airport, the airplane™s 
engine surged followed by a total loss of power. The pilot suspected that the engine had 
experienced vapor lock/fuel blockage and attempted to resolve the problem by selecting each of 
the airplane™s three fuel tanks and affirming that the mixture control was in the full rich 
position. The airplane continued to descend and the pilot elected to conduct a forced landing at 
his destination airport. The airplane did not have sufficient altitude and the pilot made a hard 
landing diagonally across the runway. During the landing, the airplane™s nose gear collapsed 
and the right wing was substantially damaged. A Federal Aviation Administration inspector 
examined the airplane on-site and reported that it appeared the underside of the fuselage had 
blue stains on it akin to the coloration of fuel; he noted that the fuel caps had duct tape on 
them. The inspector was unable to determine if the airplane™s fuel tanks contained fuel. The 
reason for the loss of engine power was not determined.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
