Analysis   
The pilot reported that during landing he noticed the wind intensity was increasing at the 
private airstrip. He departed again for his fifth aerial application flight of the day. While on the 
takeoff, as the tail was lifting off the ground, a gust of wind struck the airplane and it veered 
towards the right. The airplane exited the runway surface and struck a power pole, 
substantially damaging the wings, fuselage and empennage. The nearest weather reporting 
station, located about 13 miles from the accident airstrip, reported wind at 13 knots gusting to 
19 knots. The pilot reported no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions with the 
airframe or engine.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot™s inadequate compensation for the wind and failure to maintain directional control 
during the takeoff roll.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Environmental issues
Gusts - Contributed to outcome
Crosswind - Response/compensation (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
