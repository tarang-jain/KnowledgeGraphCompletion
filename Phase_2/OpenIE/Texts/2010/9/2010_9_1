Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The private pilot was on a personal cross-country flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91. He said he 
had arrived at an abandoned gravel airstrip, and was making a low pass to assess wind and 
runway conditions for landing. He said while making a pass 12-15 feet above the ground, he 
decided the conditions were not right for landing due to a crosswind. He reported that as he 
applied power to terminate the low pass, a gust of wind from the right rolled the airplane to the 
left, and the left wing struck the ground. The pilot said despite full rudder, aileron, and power, 
he was unable to overcome the roll. The pilot said there were no mechanical problems with the 
airplane prior to the accident, and that the wings and fuselage sustained substantial damage 
during the accident. The pilot said he had not realized how the topography around the strip 
influenced the crosswind, and how fast the weather conditions were changing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control while maneuvering at a low altitude.
Findings
Aircraft
Lateral/bank control - Capability exceeded (Cause)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
