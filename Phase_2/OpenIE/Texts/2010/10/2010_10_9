Part 91: General Aviation - Executive/Corporate
Analysis 
The pilot-in-command (PIC) was the pilot flying and the copilot was the pilot monitoring. As 
the flight approached Teterboro Airport (TEB), Teterboro, New Jersey, the pilots received the 
current automated terminal information service data, which included visibility 2 miles in light 
rain and mist, ceiling 800 feet broken, and wind from 360 degrees at 6 knots, gusting to 16 
knots. The pilots programmed the flight management system with the current data, which 
provided a reference speed (ref) of 136 knots. The approach was briefed and the PIC elected to 
add 10 knots to the Vref speed due to the wind conditions. The flight descended on a localizer 
approach for runway 6, a 6,013-foot-long, 150-foot wide, grooved asphalt runway. The 
autopilot was disconnected after the airplane descended through 1,000 feet mean sea level 
(msl) at Vref plus 10 knots. As the airplane descended through 700 feet msl, the copilot 
obtained a wind check from the tower controller, which indicated the wind was from 010 
degrees at 15 knots, gusting to 25 knots. FDR data indicate that the airspeed slowed from Vref 
plus 10 knots to Vref, and the PIC disconnected the autothrottles about 645 feet msl, in an 
attempt to manually control the throttles and regain airspeed. The airspeed then fluctuated 
from Vref plus 5 knots to Vref plus 15 knots. 
The copilot made airspeed callouts throughout the approach, which included Vref plus 15 as 
the airplane descended through 200 feet and Vref plus 15 again as the airplane was 40 feet 
above the runway. The airplane descended into ground effect at 150 to 160 knots, floated and 
bounced, before finally touching down with approximately 2,250 feet of runway remaining (as 
captured in airport surveillance video). The thrust reversers were timely deployed by the 
captain and operated correctly. The ground spoilers, brakes, and anti-skid system also 
operated correctly when automatically deployed; however, the airplane traveled off the end of 
the runway about 40 to 50 knots and came to rest 100 feet into an engineered materials 
arresting system. There was no mention of a go-around by either pilot during the flight.
 
According to the PIC's written statement, the airplane was at Vref speed, just prior to 
touchdown, when a gust of wind caused it to float. He further stated that at no point did either 
Page 2 of 9ERA11IA006
pilot believe there was not adequate runway remaining to continue the landing. After 
touchdown, at 80 knots, the PIC and copilot continued to believe the airplane would stop on 
the remaining runway; however, the airplane had floated about 65 percent of the length of the 
runway before touching down. During a subsequent telephone interview, the PIC remarked 
that a Vref plus 15 callout by the copilot, at 50 feet above the runway, would have been cause 
for an immediate go around; yet neither pilot called for one during the flight. According to the 
copilot's written statement, it was not apparent to him that the airplane might not stop on the 
runway until 400 to 500 feet before the end of the runway, when maximum braking and anti-
skid were operating. 
Data from the airplane manufacturer, for the estimated landing weight, revealed the airplane 
required a landing distance of approximately 2,820 feet on a dry runway, or 3,600 feet on a wet 
runway, without wind factored. Runway 1 at TEB is 7,000 feet long but does not have an 
instrument approach due to the proximity of Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) 
airspace (EWR is 10 miles southwest of TEB and has runways in excess of 10,000 feet). The 
approach to runway 6 has a circling approach to runway 1; however, at the time of the incident, 
the ceiling was below the circling approach minimums. The pilots could have remained 
airborne in a holding pattern a few minutes to evaluate whether the ceiling would lift 
sufficiently to fly the circling approach to the longer runway, they could have diverted to EWR, 
or they could have initiated a go-around to land on runway 6 when airspeed became excessive. 
Instead, they continued an unstabilized approach in gusting crosswind conditions and failed to 
initiate a go around when airspeed at the end of the approach became excessive.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
The pilot-in-command's failure to attain the proper touchdown point while landing with a 
gusting crosswind and failure to initiate a go-around, which resulted in a landing more than 
halfway down the runway and a subsequent runway overrun. Contributing to the incident was 
the failure of either pilot to call for a go-around when the airplane was at Vref plus 15 at 50 feet 
above the runway or once they had floated well beyond the touchdown zone of the runway.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On October 1, 2010, at 1337 eastern daylight time, a Gulfstream Aerospace G-IV, N923CL, 
operated by Avenue Capital Management II and managed by General Aviation Flying Service 
Inc., d.b.a Meridian Air Charter Inc, incurred minor damage during a landing overrun on 
runway 6 at Teterboro Airport (TEB), Teterboro, New Jersey. The two certificated airline 
transport pilots, one flight attendant, and seven passengers were not injured. The corporate 
flight was conducted under the provision of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Instrument 
meteorological conditions prevailed and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the 
flight that departed from Lester B. Pearson International Airport (CYYZ), Toronto, Canada, 
about 1204.
 
According to written statements, the pilot-in-command (PIC) was the pilot flying and the 
copilot was the pilot monitoring. As the flight approached TEB, the pilots received the current 
automated terminal information system (ATIS) data, which indicated the winds were from 360 
degrees at 6 knots, gusting to 15 knots. The pilots programmed the flight management system 
with the current winds and temperature, which provided a reference speed (ref) of 136 knots. 
The approach was briefed and the pilots elected to add 10 knots to the ref speed due to the 
wind conditions. The flight descended on a localizer approach for runway 6, a 6,013 foot long, 
150-foot-wide, grooved asphalt runway. While descending through 700 feet mean sea level 
(msl), the copilot obtained a wind check from the control tower, which indicated the winds 
were from 010 degrees at 15 knots, gusting to 25 knots. About 500 feet msl, the flight 
experienced some buffeting and slowed to 136 knots. The autothrottles were then deactivated 
by the PIC and he manually controlled the throttles while the airspeed varied between ref plus 
5 knots and ref plus 15 knots.
 
The PIC further stated that, in the landing flare, the copilot announced the speed was ref plus 
10 knots, and the PIC reduced the throttles to idle power. At ref speed, just prior to touchdown, 
a gust of wind caused the airplane to "float up" approximately 15 feet above the ground, before 
descending back down to the runway. The PIC further stated that at no point did either pilot 
believe there was not adequate runway remaining to continue the landing. The airplane 
touched down at 120 knots and the copilot stated that a crew advisory system (CAS) message 
generated for ground spoiler deployment. Thrust reversers then deployed and braking began 
immediately, with activation of the anti-skid system. At that point the airplane was 
decelerating through 80 knots and the pilots still felt the airplane would stop on the remaining 
runway; however, the airplane departed the end of the runway at 40 to 50 knots. The airplane 
traveled about 100 feet into an engineered materials arresting system (EMAS), located 
immediately beyond the runway, and came to rest.
 
During a subsequent telephone interview, the PIC remarked that a "Ref +15" callout by the 
copilot, at 50 feet above the runway, would be an immediate cause for a go-around.
 
Page 4 of 9ERA11IA006
The copilot's statement was consistent with the PIC's. The copilot added that the airplane 
touched down about halfway down the runway and although the spoilers didn't initially deploy, 
the CAS light extinguished before he could manually deploy the spoilers. The copilot didn't 
think the airplane might not stop on the runway until 400 to 500 feet before the end of the 
runway, when maximum braking and anti-skid were operating.
 
According to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, review of airport surveillance 
video indicated that the airplane touched down on runway 6 near the intersection of taxiway 
"L," which was about 2,250 feet before the departure end of runway 6.
 
PILOT INFORMATION
The PIC, age 39, held an airline transport pilot certificate, with a rating for airplane 
multiengine land. He also held a type rating for the Gulfstream IV. The PIC reported a total 
flight experience of 7,100 hours on his most recent FAA first-class medical certificate, which 
was issued on July 30, 2010. Of the total flight experience, the PIC had accumulated 759 hours 
in the Gulfstream IV. He flew 76 hours and 46 hours during the 90-day and 30-day periods 
preceding the accident, respectively. He also reported flying 9 hours during the 24-hour period 
prior to the accident.
 
The copilot, age 40, held an airline transport pilot certificate, with a rating for airplane 
multiengine land. He also held a type rating for the Gulfstream IV. The copilot reported a total 
flight experience of 4,500 hours on his most recent FAA first-class medical certificate, which 
was issued on July 2, 2010. Of the total flight experience, the copilot had accumulated 724 
hours in the Gulfstream IV. He flew 62 hours and 46 hours during the 90-day and 30-day 
periods preceding the accident, respectively. He also reported flying 9 hours during the 24-
hour period prior to the accident.
 
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
The 16-seat airplane, serial number 1471, was manufactured in 2001. It was powered by two 
Rolls-Royce TAY 611-8 engines, each capable of generating 13,850 pounds of thrust. The 
airplane was also used by the operator for on-demand air taxi under the provisions of 14 CFR 
Part 135, and it was maintained under a continuous airworthiness program. The airplane's 
most recent inspection was completed August 15, 2010. At that time, the airplane had 
accumulated 2,391 total hours of operation.
Following the incident, the management company checked the brake wear and anti-skid 
system under the supervision of their FAA principle maintenance inspector, and no 
discrepancies were noted, nor did the pilots report any.
 
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION
The weather reported at TEB, at 1334, was: wind from 360 degrees at 12 knots, gusting to 19 
knots; visibility 3 miles in light rain; broken ceiling at 600 feet, broken ceiling at 2,200 feet, 
Page 5 of 9ERA11IA006
and overcast ceiling at 4,000 feet; temperature 17 degrees Celsius (C); dew point 14 degrees C; 
altimeter 29.62 inches of mercury.
FLIGHT RECORDERS
The airplane was equipped with a cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and a digital flight data 
recorder (DFDR), which were forwarded to the NTSB Vehicle Recorders Laboratory, 
Washington, DC for data download.
Cockpit Voice Recorder
Review of the CVR recording revealed that the copilot remarked that the airspeed was "Ref + 
10" as the airplane descended through 1,000 feet. The copilot then announced the airspeed as 
"Ref + 5" and "Ref" about 30 seconds and 45 seconds later, respectively. After requesting and 
receiving a wind check from air traffic control (ATC), the copilot noted the airspeed as "Ref 
+5," followed by "Ref +12" 4 seconds later. As the airplane descended through 200 feet, the 
copilot remarked that the airspeed was "Ref + 15," and he remarked again that the airspeed 
was "Ref + 15" as the airplane descended through 40 feet. There was no discussion or mention 
of a go-around on the recording.
 
Flight Data Recorder
Review of the data downloaded from the DFDR revealed that the airplane descended through 
1,000 feet above ground level (agl) at 1334:55, at a calibrated airspeed (CAS) of approximately 
160 knots, and the autopilot was disconnected at 1334:57. The autothrottles were disconnected 
at 1335:46, when the airplane was at 645 feet agl. The airplane descended through 500 feet agl 
at 1336:08, at a CAS of approximately 140 knots, and the airspeed subsequently increased 
about 20 knots, returning to 160 knots, where it remained until the airplane descended 
through 50 feet agl, at 1339:36, to ground level at 1336:43.
 
The left main landing gear weight-on-wheels switch went from air to ground at 1336:51, back to 
air, then back to ground at 1336:52, back to air, then back to ground a third time at 1136:57. 
The right main landing gear weight-on-wheels switch went from air to ground at 1336:51, and 
remained in the ground position. The CAS at 1336:51 was approximately 150 knots. The ground 
spoilers deployed at 1336:58, the thrust reversers deployed at 1336:59, and the brake pressure 
increased at 1337:01.
 
WRECKAGE INFORMATION
An FAA inspector reported that the airplane came to rest about 100 feet into the 400-foot-long 
EMAS. The inspector observed damage to the airplane's nosegear landing light and damage 
consistent with foreign object damage to both engines.
 
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL
Review of ATC recordings revealed that the flight crew contacted New York terminal radar 
approach control (TRACON) about 1320 and advised that they had ATIS information Uniform 
Page 6 of 9ERA11IA006
at TEB. The weather information contained in Uniform included wind from 360 degrees at 6 
knots, gusting to 16 knots, visibility 2 miles in light rain and mist, and a broken ceiling at 800 
feet.
 
The New York TRACON controller cleared the flight for the localizer runway 6 approach to 
TEB at 1332 and transferred communication to the TEB tower at 1333. The flight crew 
acknowledged both the clearance and transfer to TEB tower. When the flight crew contacted 
TEB tower at 1333, the tower controller reported the current wind from 360 degrees at 8 knots, 
which the flight crew acknowledged. About 1 minute later, the flight crew requested a wind 
check, to which the controller replied wind from 010 degrees at 15 knots, gusting to 20 knots. 
About 45 seconds later, the controller called for emergency vehicles to assist the airplane.
 
At 1331, ATIS information Victor was current, which included wind from 360 degrees at 14 
knots, gusting to 19 knots, visibility 3 miles in light rain, and ceiling 800 feet broken.
 
At 1334, ATIS information Whisky was current, which included wind from 010 degrees at 12 
knots, gusting to 19 knots, visibility 3 miles in light rain, and ceiling 600 feet broken.
 
Review of an FAA "LOC RWY 6" terminal information procedure chart revealed the minimum 
descent altitude for the approach was 440 feet, and the circling altitude was 760 feet, with 1 
mile visibility.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Landing Distance
According to a representative from the airplane manufacturer, at an estimated landing weight 
of 53,800 pounds, the airplane (operating under Part 91) required a landing distance of 2,820 
feet on a dry runway, or 3,600 feet on a wet runway, without wind factored. Runway 1 at TEB 
was 7,000 feet long but did not have an instrument approach due to the proximity of Newark 
Liberty International Airport (EWR) airspace (EWR is 10 miles southwest of TEB and has 
runways in excess of 10,000 feet). The approach to runway 6 did have a circling approach to 
runway 1; however, at the time of the incident, the ceiling was below the circling approach 
minimums.
72-hour History
During subsequent separate telephone interviews, the pilots similarly described their 72 hour 
history prior to the event. On September 28, they departed TEB for England about 2000. They 
arrived the following morning and were on an approximate 36-hour rest period at the hotel 
until the evening of September 30, when they departed for CYYZ. They landed in CYYZ about 
0300 local time on October 1, rested in a hotel for 4 to 5 hours, and departed on the incident 
flight about 1200. Both pilots indicated that they normally slept about 8 hours per night and 
that they slept for 4 to 5 hours in their hotel prior to the incident flight.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
