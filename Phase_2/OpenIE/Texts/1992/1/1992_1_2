Analysis 
 WEATHER CONDITIONS ALONG THE AIRCRAFT'S FLIGHT ROUTE WERE CONDUCIVE 
TO CARBURETOR ICING.  THE PILOT ENTERED AN AUROTATIVE DESCENT WITHOUT 
APPLYING FULL CARBURETOR HEAT AS RECOMMENDED BY THE AIRCRAFT 
MANUFACTURER. THE ENGINE FAILED DURING THE DESCENT AND THE 
HELICOPTER LANDED HARD AND ROLLED OVER ON ITS SIDE.  THE PILOT HAD 
RECEIVED MOST OF HIS FLIGHT EXPERIENCE IN TURBINE POWERED HELICOPTERS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE PILOT'S IMPROPER USE OF THE CARBURETOR HEAT CONTROL AND DELAY IN 
FLARING THE HELICOPTER FOR AN AUTOROTATIVE TOUCHDOWN. CARBURETOR 
ICING CONDITIONS AND THE SOFT TERRAIN WERE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS IN THE 
ACCIDENT.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
