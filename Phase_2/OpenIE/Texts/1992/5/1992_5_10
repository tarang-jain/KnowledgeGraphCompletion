Aircraft:
BEECH A23-24

Destroyed

2 Fatal
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
 A STUDENT PILOT WAS IN THE LEFT SEAT OF HIS NEWLY PURCHASED AIRCRAFT 
AND A PRIVATE PILOT OCCUPIED THE RIGHT SEAT. THE INVESTIGATION WAS 
UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHO WAS FLYING THE AIRCRAFT AT THE TIME OF THE 
ACCIDENT. THE PILOTS INITIATED A GO AROUND AFTER A HARD LANDING WHICH 
SHEARED OFF THE LEFT MAIN LANDING GEAR, BROKE THE NOSE GEAR STRUT, AND 
DAMAGED THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER. WITNESSES STATED THAT THE CLIMB 
RATE AND THE AIRSPEED APPEARED TO BE VERY LOW, AND THAT THE LEFT 
HORIZONTAL STABILIZER APPEARED TO BE BENT DOWN. ACCORDING TO 
WITNESSES, DURING THE CROSS WIND AND DOWN WIND LEGS, THE AIRPLANE WAS 
MAKING ABRUPT PITCH CHANGES AND NEVER ATTAINED ALTITUDES OF MORE 
THAN 300 TO 500 FEET AGL.  WHILE ON A CLOSE IN DOWN WIND LEG, THE AIRPLANE 
STRUCK AN INDUSTRIAL BUILDING WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET HIGHER 
THAN THE RUNWAY SURFACE. THE STUDENT PILOT HAD JUST TRADED ANOTHER 
AIRPLANE FOR THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE WHICH HAD JUST HAD AN ANNUAL 
INSPECTION AND WAS SIGNED OFF AS UNAIRWORTHY. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 1) THE FLYING PILOT'S IMPROPER LANDING FLARE WHICH RESULTED IN A HARD 
LANDING AND SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT EMPENNAGE FLIGHT 
CONTROLS, 2) THE FLYING PILOT'S DECISION TO INITIATE A GO AROUND WITH THE 
OBVIOUS SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT, AND 3) THE FLYING PILOT'S 
INABILITY TO CONTROL THE AIRCRAFT IN PITCH DUE TO THE DAMAGE SUSTAINED 
IN THE HARD LANDING.  A FACTOR IN THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOTS LACK OF 
EXPERIENCE IN THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
