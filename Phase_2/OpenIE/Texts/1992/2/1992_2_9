Analysis 
 THE PILOT WAS SIMULATING A FORCED LANDING TO AN ABANDONED GRASS STRIP. 
WHEN HE APPLIED POWER TO TERMINATE THE MANEUVER, HE 'PUSHED THE 
THROTTLE TO FULL POWER' BUT THE ENGINE FAILED TO RESPOND DUE TO 
CARBURETOR ICING. THE PILOT LANDED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE STRIP FOR 
WHICH HE WAS LINED UP FOR HIS SIMULATED FORCED LANDING. THE EXISTING 
WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WERE HIGHLY CONDUCIVE 
TO THE FORMATION OF CARBURETOR ICING. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PILOT'S IMPROPER USE OF CARBURETOR HEAT RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF 
ENGINE POWER DUE TO CARBURETOR ICE. THE CARBURETOR ICING CONDITIONS 
AND THE SOFT TERRAIN IN THE LANDING AREA WERE FACTORS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
