Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
 THE 60 HOUR STUDENT PILOT HAD A TOTAL OF 25 HOURS IN TYPE, ALL OF WHICH 
WERE DUAL. WITH HIS CURRENT FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR THE STUDENT RETURNED TO 
THEIR HOME BASE AIRPORT TO PERFORM A PREARRANGED GO-AROUND TO 
FINALIZE THEIR DUAL PERIOD FOR THE EVENING. AFTER THE APPROACH TO THE 
RUNWAY, THE INSTRUCTOR CALLED FOR THE GO-AROUND. AFTER THE CLIMB WAS 
ESTABLISHED AT ABOUT 500 FEET AGL HE CALLED FOR THE COWL FLAPS TO BE 
OPENED, AND MOMENTS LATER THE ENGINE SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT WARNING 
QUIT. THE INSTRUCTOR SAID THAT AFTER THE ENGINE QUIT THE STUDENT PULLED 
THE CONTROL YOKE ALL THE WAY BACK AND THE AIRCRAFT ENTERED A DEEP 
STALL. THE AIRPLANE HAD BEEN MODIFIED TO ACCOMMODATE AN ENGINE WITH 
MORE HORSE POWER WHICH REQUIRED THE INSTALLATION OF COWL FLAPS. THE 
FAA APPROVED STC MODIFICATION DRAWINGS REQUIRED THE PUSH-PULL 
CONTROL FOR THE COWL FLAPS TO BE LOCATED TO THE LEFT OF THE THROTTLE 
CONSOLE ON A SEPARATE SWITCH PANEL. THE ACTUAL LOCATION OF THAT 
CONTROL IN THE ACCIDENT AIRPLANE WAS FOUND TO THE RIGHT OF THE 
THROTTLE BELOW THE PROPELLER CONTROL AND NEXT TO 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE STUDENT PILOT'S INADVERTENT USE OF THE MIXTURE CONTROL INSTEAD OF 
THE COWL FLAPS AT A CRITICAL PHASE OF FLIGHT, HIS MISUSE OF THE FLIGHT 
CONTROLS AFTER THE ENGINE FAILURE AND THE INSTRUCTOR'S INADEQUATE 
SUPERVISION OF THE STUDENT. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS IN THE ACCIDENT WERE: 
THE NON STANDARD LOCATION OF THE COWL FLAP PUSH PULL CONTROL, DUE TO 
AN IMPROPER AIRCRAFT MODIFICATION, THE DARK NIGHT LIGHT CONDITIONS 
WHICH IMPAIRED THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS ABILITY TO MONITOR THE STUDENT 
COCKPIT CONTROL MANIPULATIONS.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
