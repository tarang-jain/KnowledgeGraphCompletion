Analysis 
 THE OWNER, SEATED IN THE RIGHT SEAT ALLOWED A PROSPECTIVE BUYER SEATED 
IN THE LEFT SEAT TO MAKE THE TAKEOFF.  AFTER GETTING AIRBORNE, THE 
AIRPLANE WAS OBSERVED TO PITCH UP TO A NEAR VERTICAL ATTITUDE, FALL OFF 
ON A WING AND THEN STRIKE THE GROUND NOSE FIRST.  THE PROSPECTIVE BUYER 
HAD NO PREVIOUS TIME IN THE AIRPLANE, AND WAS A PRIVATE PILOT WITH 150 
HOURS TOTAL TIME.  THE OWNER/OPERATOR HAS LESS THAN 100 HOURS TOTAL 
TIME AND WAS UNRESTRAINED IN THE AIRPLANE WHICH WAS EQUIPPED WITH 
ONLY ONE SET OF SEAT BELTS. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 IMPROPER USE OF THE FLIGHT CONTROLS BY THE PROSPECTIVE BUYER, AND THE 
FAILURE OF THE OWNER/OPERATOR TO ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE THE 
PROSPECTIVE BUYER.  FACTORS RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WERE THE LACK OF 
EXPERIENCE IN TYPE OF AIRPLANE FOR THE PROSPECTIVE BUYER, AND THE LACK 
OF A RESTRAINT SYSTEM FOR THE PASSENGER.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
