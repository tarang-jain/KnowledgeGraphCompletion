Analysis 
 THE AG PILOT HAD BEEN SPRAYING COTTON FIELDS FOR ABOUT AN HOUR, AND 
WAS PERFORMING ANOTHER PASS. HE REPORTED 'ROLLING AND TURBULENT' 
WINDS NEAR THE TREE LINES. AS HE PULLED THE STICK AFT TO ARREST THE SINK 
RATE, THE AIRCRAFT CONTINUED TO DESCEND. THE LANDING GEAR BOGGED DOWN 
IN THE COTTON AND THE AIRCRAFT CONTACTED THE GROUND, RESULTING IN 
STRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO THE AIRFRAME. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT JUST PRIOR 
TO THE COLLISION, HE LOST ABOUT 20 KNOTS OF AIRSPEED DUE TO WIND SHEAR. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
 THE PILOT'S INADEQUATE COMPENSATION FOR EXISTING WIND CONDITIONS, 
WHICH RESULTED IN HIS INABILITY TO MAINTAIN A PROPER ALTITUDE. FACTORS 
WERE THE TURBULENCE AND WIND SHEAR PRESENT AT THE TIME OF THE 
ACCIDENT.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
