Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot stated that he was flying traffic patterns and was practicing landings to a full stop. His 
first landing was satisfactory, just landing beyond the runway numbers. The second traffic 
pattern was again satisfactory until he was on short final approach. His airspeed was too high, 
and the airplane touched down just passed the runway numbers and bounced "high".  He 
misjudged the severity of the bounced landing and failed to apply engine power to correct the 
situation. The airplane immediately started to porpoise, and became "uncontrollable". The 
pilot stated there were no mechanical failures or malfunction to the airplane or any of it's 
systems prior to the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings

The pilot's improper flare and recovery from a bounced landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
