Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The pilot stated that he had been practicing short field approaches at the Sandpoint Airport 
with a flight instructor and then decided to go to his property where he had a private airstrip.  
The pilot stated that the flight instructor was flying the glider, making a low approach over the 
airstrip when he unexpectedly decided to land.  The airspeed was too high to stop on the 
remaining runway which was covered with compacted snow.  After rolling about 300 feet, the 
flight instructor applied full throttle for the takeoff.  The pilot pointed out the power lines 
beyond the end of the runway, and the flight instructor stated that they would fly under them.  
At this time the left wing struck a tractor that was positioned at the end of the airstrip.  The 
wing separated from the airframe and the glider spun around, coming to rest.  The pilot stated 
that there was no mechanical failure or malfunction with the glider at the time of the accident.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
Excessive speed for the landing roll and inadequate remedial action for the initial takeoff.  An 
object near the end of the runway and snow covered surface were factors.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
