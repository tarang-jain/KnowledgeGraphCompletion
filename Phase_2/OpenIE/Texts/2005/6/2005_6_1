Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
A pilot applicant was demonstrating a simulated power failure from a two-foot hover to an FAA 
inspector when he lost control of the helicopter.  The helicopter drifted aft and to the left before 
it impacted the ground and rolled on its left side. The FAA inspector's attempts to recover the 
helicopter were unsuccessful.  According to the FAA Rotorcraft Flying Handbook, common 
errors when executing a power failure in a hover are; failing to use sufficient proper antitorque 
pedal when power is reduced, failing to stop all sideward and backward movement prior to 
touchdown, failing to apply up-collective pitch properly, resulting in a hard touchdown, failing 
to touch down at a level attitude, and not rolling the throttle completely to idle.  In addition, "A 
helicopter is susceptible to a lateral rolling tendency, called dynamic rollover, when lifting off 
of the surface.  For dynamic rollover to occur, some factor has to first cause the helicopter to 
roll or pivot around a skid, or landing gear wheel, until its critical rollover angle is reached.  
Then, beyond this point, main rotor thrust continues the roll and recovery is impossible.  If the 
critical angle is exceeded, the helicopter rolls on its side regardless of the cyclic corrections 
made."  
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The applicant's failure to maintain directional control of the helicopter during a simulated 
power failure from a hover and the FAA inspector's delayed remedial action resulted in a 
dynamic rollover.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
