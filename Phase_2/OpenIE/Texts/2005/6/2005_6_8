Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
According to the pilot, when he departed his departure airport for his short cross-country flight 
he requested to fly visual flight rules on top due to the low visibility. Upon arriving at the 
destination airport, the pilot discovered that there was a cloud layer over the airport. He looked 
for an opening in the clouds so that he could begin his descent. During the descent through the 
clouds the pilot encountered instrument meteorological conditions. As the flight descended 
through the clouds, the airplane collided with the ground. The pilot did not report any flight 
control or mechanical anomalies prior to the accident. The nearest weather reporting facility 
Crossville Memorial Airport reported: scattered clouds at 1000 feet, overcast at 1700 feet, and 
seven miles visibility.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's continued VFR flight into IMC conditions which resulted in an in-flight collision 
with trees.  A related factor was the clouds.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
