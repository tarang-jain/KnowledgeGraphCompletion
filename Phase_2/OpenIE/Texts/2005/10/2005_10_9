Analysis   
The pilot and flight instructor were practicing soft field landings on the turf runway.  During 
the landing rollout, the right main landing gear collapsed and the airplane nosed over.  The 
right landing gear was fractured completely around a weld where the gear attached to the 
spindle assembly.  Metallurgical examination of the fracture revealed features typical of an 
overstress separation, with no evidence of fatigue cracking.
 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
An overload fracture of the right main landing gear during the landing roll, which resulted in a 
nose over.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
