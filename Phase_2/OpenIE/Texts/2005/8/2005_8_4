Analysis   
The experimental amateur-built airplane was destroyed by fire during its taxi to parking after a 
landing.  The pilot stated, "After reaching pattern altitude I turned on boost pump and 
approach flaps, and opened cowl flaps.  I then pulled power back to enter upwind.  Engine felt 
like it was going to quit.  I entered down wind and pulled throttle back all the way.  I landed 
and turned on to taxi way.  There was smoke coming out of instrument panel.  I shut down 
everything and got out of plane to check front of plane.  Engine was still turning over then it 
stopped.  I went back inside to get fire extinguisher.  I went back outside and shot extinguisher 
up cow flaps.  Could not stop fire and plane was destroyed."  Examination of the wreckage did 
not reveal the source of the fire.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
