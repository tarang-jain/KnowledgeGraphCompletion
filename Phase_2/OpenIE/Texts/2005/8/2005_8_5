Analysis   
The airplane stalled and impacted the ground near the departure end of the runway during the 
pilot's attempted go around.  The pilot reported that on approach, he had been a little high and 
fast, so he elected to go around.  After increasing engine power, the airplane stalled and 
descended a few feet until colliding with the ground.  The pilot reported that no mechanical 
malfunctions were experienced during the flight.  He said his airplane had worked flawlessly, 
and the accident resulted from his error.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
