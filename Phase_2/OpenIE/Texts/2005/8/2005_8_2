Location:
Willard, MO
Accident Number:
CHI05CA208
Date & Time:
08/01/2005, 1830 CDT 
Registration:
N6846J
Aircraft:
Piper PA-28-181
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The airplane sustained substantial damage when in veered off the end of the runway, impacted 
a utility pole, and nosed over during landing on a 1,800 feet by 75 feet grass runway.  The pilot 
reported that on final approach the airplane was configured with two notches of flaps with 80 
mph airspeed.  The airplane touched down in the first one-third of the runway and the pilot 
applied brakes.  The pilot reported the airplane was approaching the end of the runway so he 
applied a burst of power to initiate a go-around.  He reported that he saw power lines off the 
end of the runway, and since he was not airborne yet, he rejected the go-around and initiated 
heavy braking.  The airplane went off the end of the runway and veered to the right, impacting 
a utility pole.  The pilot reported the temperature was 96 degrees Fahrenheit, and that the 
high-density altitude affected the landing ground roll adversely.  The pilot reported that the 
approach speed noted in the Pilot Operating Handbook was 76 mph.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The airplane overran the runway and hit a utility pole due to the pilot's delayed decision 
making and his failure to execute a go-around.  Contributing factors included the exessive 
airspeed during the final approach, the high density altitude, the transmission wires, and the 
utility pole.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
