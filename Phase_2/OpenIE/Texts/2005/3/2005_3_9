Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The flight was cruising at 3,000 feet approximately 15 nautical miles north of Bomar Field - 
Shelbyville Municipal Airport, Shelbyville, Tennessee, when the engine sputtered and lost 
power. The pilot stated he moved the fuel selector from the auxiliary fuel tank to the right main 
fuel tank, established glide airspeed, and reported the loss of engine power to the Nashville air 
traffic control tower. The pilot stated he tried to find a road or clearing for landing, but he 
could not distinguish the terrain in the darkness. The pilot glided the airplane toward a dark 
area, then turned on the landing light and immediately saw treetops. The airplane collided with 
the trees and the ground. The pilot reported no mechanical malfunction with the airplane. He 
stated he had planned to change the selected fuel tank in five or ten minutes, and he had 
inadvertently allowed the auxiliary tank to run out of fuel before switching to a tank containing 
fuel. The elevation at the accident site was approximately 830 feet.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's mismanagement of the fuel supply by his failure to switch the fuel selector position , 
which resulted in a loss of engine power due to fuel starvation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
