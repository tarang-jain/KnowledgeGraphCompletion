Berrien Springs, MI
Accident Number:
CHI05CA060
Date & Time:
02/01/2005, 0850 EST 
Registration:
N9515B
Aircraft:
Cessna 172RG
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The airplane, piloted by a private pilot receiving instruction from a certified flight instructor 
(CFI), sustained substantial damage during a hard landing following a simulated loss of engine 
power during takeoff and subsequent emergency landing after takeoff.  The pilot's accident 
report stated, "On climb out, the air speed was held between 63 and 65 knots (Vy).  To simulate 
an engine failure, the CFI reduced the throttle.  Immediately upon noticing the loss of power, I 
lowered the nose of the aircraft to avoid loss of airspeed and to avoid a wing stall.  While 
maintaining control of the aircraft, altitude was lost.  An attempt was made to flare the aircraft 
before contact with the runway.  Subsequently, a hard landing was made, and the aircraft came 
to a complete stop on the runway."  The CFI's accident report stated, "We then made a short 
field takeoff and during the takeoff I simulated an engine failure.  We immediately pushed the 
nose over but with insufficient airspeed we developed a high sink rate and made a hard 
landing."  The CFI stated that there were no mechanical malfunctions associated with the 
airplane during the flight.  The wind was calm.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot not maintaining airspeed leading to an excessive sink rate during a simulated 
emergency landing after takeoff.  An additional cause was the certified flight instructor's 
inadequate supervision.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
