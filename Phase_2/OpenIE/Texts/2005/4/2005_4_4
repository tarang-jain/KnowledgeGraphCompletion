Analysis   
The 99-hour student pilot, who had logged 2.4 hours of solo time, reported that on final 
approach to runway 17, his airspeed was 61 knots.  He planned on making a normal landing, 
and when he reached the runway, he "pulled the throttle to idle and flared," but the airplane 
"hit the ground heavily and jumped back up."  The pilot then "lowered the airplane nose and 
flared again."  When the airplane touched down, the student pilot noticed that he was left of 
the centerline, so he applied right rudder.  "Suddenly, the nose gear broke, and the airplane 
nose fell on the ground."  The propeller then hit the ground and stopped, and the airplane 
came to a stop.  The student pilot performed the proper shutdown procedures and exited the 
airplane, uninjured.  Reported winds at the time of the landing on runway 17 were from 200 
degrees at 8 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper landing flare and his inadequate recovery from a bounced landing.  A 
factor was the prevailing crosswind.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
