Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Montague, CA
Accident Number:
LAX05CA129
Date & Time:
04/02/2005, 1040 PST 
Registration:
N50G
Aircraft:
Beech D50C
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
Following a loss of engine power from the right engine during takeoff, the airplane veered to 
the right of the runway and collided with a hangar.  The pilot reported that he had found a leak 
in a fuel line fitting on the right engine during the flight prior to the accident.  He fixed the leak 
by tightening the fitting; however, he had not determined how much fuel remained in the right 
main fuel tank after the repair or during preflight for the accident flight.  The pilot said the 
start, taxi, and run-up were normal on both engines.  Just after liftoff, the airplane yawed to 
the right.  Despite full left rudder and aileron input, the pilot could not prevent the airplane 
from veering off the runway and colliding with a hangar.  An examination of the airplane after 
the accident determined that the fuel system for the right wing was still intact, and that there 
were no leaks.  The right auxiliary fuel tank was still full of fuel.  No fuel was found in the right 
main fuel tank or in any of the fuel lines leading to the right engine.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate aircraft preflight and failure to verify that an adequate fuel supply was in 
the right main tank prior to flight, resulting in a fuel starvation induced loss of engine power in 
the right engine.  Also causal was the pilot's failure to maintain directional control following 
the loss of engine power.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
