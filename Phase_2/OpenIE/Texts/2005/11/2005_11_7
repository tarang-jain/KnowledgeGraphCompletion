Analysis   
The airplane collided with a hangar while taxiing from landing to parking.  The pilot was 
making a right-hand turn off the taxiway when his left wing came into contact with a hangar.  
The airplane veered left, and the propeller struck the outside wall of the structure.  The 
collision resulted in damage to the hangar, propeller, and extensive damage to the left wing.  
The pilot felt that an excessive taxi speed and his misjudgment of the right-hand turn led to the 
accident.  He stated that the airplane and engine had no mechanical failures or malfunctions 
during the flight.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
