Analysis   
The 485-hour flight instructor and the 11-hour student pilot were executing a crosswind 
landing during a local training flight.  Shortly after touch down on Runway 17R, the nose 
landing gear collapsed, and the airplane began to skid down the runway.  While attempting to 
bring the airplane to a stop, the propeller and left wing contacted the ground.  The winds at the 
time of the mishap were reported from 180 degrees at 11 knots.   An examination of the 
airplane by an Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that the axel for the 
nose landing gear was missing and it was later located along the centerline of the runway.  The 
lock nut securing the axle to the landing gear assembly was not located, and it was not 
determined why the nut was not in place.  The last annual inspection was completed on 
October 24, 2005, about 22.2 hours prior to the mishap.  No recent maintenance was reported 
on the nose landing gear assembly.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inability to maintain directional control of the airplane while landing due to the 
separation of the nose landing gear tire assembly.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
