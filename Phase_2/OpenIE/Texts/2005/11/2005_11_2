Aircraft:
Robinson R44
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Injuries:
1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - External Load
Analysis   
The pilot was conducting external load operations, when a gust of wind blew the lifting strap 
into the tail rotor.  The helicopter began to shudder, and rotate to the left.  The pilot entered an 
autorotation; however, during landing, the helicopter rolled over onto its left side.  Winds 
reported at an airport located about 4 miles east-southeast of the accident site, about the time 
of the accident, were from 200 degrees at 17 knots, with 23 knot gusts.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The inadvertent contact of a lift strap with the tail rotor during external load operations, which 
resulted in a forced landing and subsequent collision with terrain.  A factor in this accident was 
the gusty wind conditions.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
