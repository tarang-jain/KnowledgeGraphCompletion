Analysis   
The pilot reported that the pin that secured the control stick to the elevator control system 
came out, the control stick disconnected from elevator control rods, and he lost elevator 
authority.  The pilot conducted a forced landing in an alfalfa field and the nose landing gear 
collapsed when it encountered the field's border.  The airplane underwent its last annual 
inspection 34.5 hours prior to the accident.  At the time of the last inspection the airframe and 
flight controls were lubricated.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the in-flight separation of the control stick.  A contributing factor was the rough terrain for the 
forced landing, which resulted in a collapsed landing gear.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
