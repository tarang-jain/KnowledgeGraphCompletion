Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The airplane stalled and collided with terrain during takeoff, and went into a canal.  The pilot 
reported that the weight of the airplane was 2,300 pounds, which is 150 pounds above the 
certified maximum gross weight of the airplane.  He stated that he had not paid thorough 
attention to the weight and balance considerations.  The airplane did not obtain enough 
airspeed at takeoff, which resulted in a departure stall, and the collision with terrain.  The pilot 
stated that the airplane and engine had no mechanical failures or malfunctions.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the pilot's failure to comply with weight and balance limitations and failure to attain an 
adequate airspeed, which resulted in a stall and loss of control.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
