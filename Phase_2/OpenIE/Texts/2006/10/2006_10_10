Analysis 
The pilot reported that he was conducting an aerial application flight. He stated that about half 
way through the third turn-around maneuver a gradual loss of power occurred. He added full 
throttle but did not notice the difference in the engine sound or the power output. He made a 
forced landing into a small field of trees and the airplane collided with the ground. The pilot 
exited the airplane, and an immediate post-crash fire consumed the airplane. Examination of 
the airplane by an FAA inspector revealed that all components for flight were located at the 
crash site. An examination of the engine revealed that all of its components were heavily fire 
damaged, and an engine examination could not be facilitated due to the fire damage. Due to 
the engine fire damage the cause of the loss of power could not be determined.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The total loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.

The pilot reported that he was conducting an aerial application flight. He stated that about half 
way through the third turn-around maneuver a gradual loss of power occurred. He added full 
throttle but did not notice the difference in the engine sound or the power output. He made a 
forced landing into a small field of trees and the airplane collided with the ground.
 
Examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector revealed that all components for flight were 
located at the crash site. An examination of the engine revealed that all of its components were 
heavily fire damaged, and an engine examination could not be facilitated due to the fire 
damage. A review of the engine logbook pages revealed that the engine was overhauled on July 
27, 2006 at an engine total time of 524.7 hours. After the engine was reinstalled it was run for 
1-hour. The owner of the airplane did not submit the airplane logbooks or records for review to

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
