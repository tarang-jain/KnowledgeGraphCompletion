Analysis   
The pilot stated that he entered the traffic pattern for runway 5 at Bessemer Airport, Bessemer, 
Alabama. "About 10 feet above the ground two deer came into the landing light from the left. I 
proceeded to go-around. As I started to pull up and climb, the left main gear contacted one of 
the deer. I continued the climb to a safe altitude and cleaned up the aircraft. I looked outside to 
inspect the left main gear to find it severely damaged." The pilot made the decision to divert to 
Birmingham International Airport, Birmingham, Alabama. The pilot was vectored for a visual 
approach to runway 36. The airplane was landed on the right main landing gear, and the pilot 
held the airplane off the ground as long as possible. The left wing and stabilizer contacted the 
runway, and the airplane went off the left side of the runway coming to a complete stop.
Probable Cause and Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
