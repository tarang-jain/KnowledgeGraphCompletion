Analysis   
The pilot stated that approximately 20 minutes after takeoff he radioed the Kendall-Tamiami 
Executive Airport Air Traffic Control Tower and requested touch-and-go landings.  He 
reported having difficulty with the aircraft's radio and was cleared for a full stop landing on 
runway 9R.  He further reported,''...the landing seemed normal; the main wheels touch down, 
but then as I noticed the yoke not releasing from the flare, the aircraft starts to balloon, I add a 
little power and attempt to land but the yoke was stiff."  The airplane ballooned "...a couple of 
times, hitting the ground hard until I finally stopped."  He taxied the airplane to the ramp and 
secured it where he again noticed the elevator control still stiff.  Postaccident examination of 
the airplane by an airframe and powerplant mechanic revealed impact damage to the firewall, 
and the control yoke was displaced up and was in contact with an instrument panel support 
bracket.  Examination of the elevator flight control system revealed no evidence of preimpact 
failure or malfunction.

The improper flare by the pilot resulting in a hard landing and substantial damage to the

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
