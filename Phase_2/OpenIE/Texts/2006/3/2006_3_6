Substantial

Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot did not ensure that the snow that had accumulated on the aircraft both prior to and 
after he began the taxi sequence was fully removed from the aircraft's wings prior to takeoff. 
During the takeoff, the aircraft did not lift off as it normally does, and the takeoff roll ended up 
being longer than usual. Once the pilot got the aircraft in the air, it was not climbing at an 
acceptable rate, so the pilot retracted the landing gear because he thought that action would 
help the aircraft to climb. Soon after the landing gear was retracted, the aircraft settled back 
onto the runway, hit a runway light, and then slid off the departure end of the runway onto a 
snow and ice covered field. According to the pilot, the engine was producing full power and was 
running very smoothly.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from the terrain during the takeoff sequence. Factors 
include his inadequate removal of snow and ice from the wings prior to takeoff, his improper 
decision to retract the landing gear before it had been positively determined that the aircraft 
would not settle back onto the runway, and snowy conditions both prior to and during the 
takeoff sequence.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
