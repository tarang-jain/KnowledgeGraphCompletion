Flight Conducted Under:
Part 137: Agricultural
Analysis   
While in cruise flight, the 19,620-hour commercial pilot lost control of the rudder pedals and 
experienced trouble maintaining directional control of the single-engine, turbine powered 
agricultural airplane.  The pilot reported that "he dumped his chemical load at a safe location" 
and elected to discontinue the aerial application flight.  The pilot proceed to a larger airport for 
a landing.  The pilot added that he made several attempts to land as he was having trouble 
keeping the airplane aligned with runway 35 unless he maintained a much higher than normal 
airspeed on final approach.  On his final attempt, the pilot was able to land, but as the airplane 
slowed down, it veered off the right side of the 5,949-foot long, by 75-foot wide asphalt runway.  
Following the loss of control, the left wing of the airplane collided with a tractor.  A Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) safety inspector performed an on-scene examination of  the 
airplane and found that the rudder horn was corroded and had completely separated.  
According to the pilot, the rudder horn is covered by fabric and it was difficult to inspect during 
a preflight inspection.  The pilot added that even though the operator has a procedure in place 
to wash the airplane after spraying corrosive chemicals, he suggested that somehow chemicals 
had made contact with the rudder horn which caused the corrosion.  At the time of the last 100 
hour inspection, which was completed less than 11 days prior to the mishap, the tailwheel-
equipped airplane had accumulated a total of 11,107.8 hours since new.  The wind at the time of 
the accident was reported from 030 degrees at 8 knots.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inability to maintain directional control while landing due to the failure of the 
rudder horn due to corrosion.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
