Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Flight Test
Analysis   
The non-instrument rated commercial pilot departed on a maintenance test flight in a single-
engine agricultural airplane.  During the test flight the airplane's radial engine lost power and 
the pilot elected to execute a forced landing to a cotton field.  The airplane sustained structural 
damage during the forced landing.  There was no fire and the pilot was able to egress the 
airplane unassisted.  The winds at the time of the accident were reported from 040 degrees at 
11knots, gusting to 18 knots.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, who 
traveled to the accident site, confirmed the airplane sustained structural damage during the 
forced landing.  Additionally, the inspector reported that the aircraft ran out of fuel.  Despite 
repeated attempts by the Investigator-In-Charge (IIC), the pilot failed to return a completed 
Pilot Operator Aircraft Accident Report Form (NTSB Form 6120.1).
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper in-flight planning resulting in the loss of engine power due to fuel 
exhaustion.  A contributing factor was the lack of suitable terrain for the forced landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
