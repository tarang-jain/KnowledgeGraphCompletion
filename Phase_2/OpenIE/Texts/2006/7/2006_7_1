Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The certificated private pilot reported that he was landing a tailwheel-equipped airplane with 
about a 3 knot quartering tailwind from the right during a Title 14, CFR Part 91 personal flight.  
During the landing roll, the airplane began to veer to the right, and the pilot's application of left 
rudder and left brake did not correct the turn.  He then applied both brakes, and the airplane 
nosed down, slid off the right edge of the runway, and nosed over.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's failure to maintain directional control of the airplane during the landing roll, which 
resulted in a nose over when the airplane departed the runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
