Analysis 
THE INSTRUCTOR PLT (CFI) ELECTED TO DEMONSTRATE A SOFT FIELD LANDING AT 
AN UNIMPROVED RANCH STRIP.  AS HE WAS ABOUT TO LAND, HE SAW MOUNDS OF 
SOFT DIRT ON THE STRIP & INCREASED POWER TO 'CARRY THE GLIDE BEYOND 
THEM.'  SUBSEQUENTLY, HE REALIZED THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT RWY REMAINING 
TO COMPLETE THE LANDING, SO HE INITIATED A GO-AROUND. HE APPLIED FULL 
POWER & RAISED THE ACFT'S NOSE TO CLEAR A FENCE, BUT THE ACFT LOST FLYING 
SPEED & SETTLED INTO A FIELD BEYOND THE LANDING AREA. THE LANDING GEAR 
THEN HIT AN IRRIGATION PIPE & WAS DAMAGED. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A DELAY BY THE PILOT IN ABORTING THE LANDING AND HIS FAILURE TO ASSURE 
SUFFICIENT AIRSPEED FOR THE GO-AROUND (ABORTED LANDING).  A FACTOR 
RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT WAS:  THE UNSUITABLE LANDING AREA THAT WAS 
SELECTED BY THE PILOT.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
