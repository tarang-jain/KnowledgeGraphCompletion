Analysis 
AFTER TAKEOFF, THE PLT TURNED TO A NORTHERLY HEADING & REMAINED AT 
LOW ALT TO VIEW HIS AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPEMENT NEAR THE AIRSTRIP. THIS 
HEADING TOOK THE ACFT TOWARD HIGH TENSION POWER LINES, JUST NORTH OF 
THE PRIVATE STRIP. THE PLT SELECTED A FLT PATH OVER THE LOWEST SAG IN THE 
LINES; HOWEVER, NEITHER HE NOR THE PASSENGER SAW THE STATIC CABLES 
ABOVE THE MAIN TRANSMISSION LINES. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE ACFT COLLIDED 
WITH AN UPPER (STATIC) CABLE. THE CABLE STOPPED THE ACFT'S FORWARD 
MOVEMENT & IT DROPPED NEARLY STRAIGHT-DOWN TO THE GROUND. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO MAINTAIN PROPER ALTITUDE AND HIS FAILURE TO 
MAINTAIN ADEQUATE VISUAL LOOKOUT TO SEE AND AVOID OBSTRUCTIONS.  THE 
STATIC LINE (OBSTRUCTION) WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
