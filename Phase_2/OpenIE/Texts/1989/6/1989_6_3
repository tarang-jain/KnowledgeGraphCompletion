Analysis 
DURING THE TAKEOFF ROLL ON AN INSTRUMENT INSTRUCTIONAL FLIGHT, WHILE 
AT A POINT APPROXIMATELY HALFWAY DOWN THE RUNWAY, THE PRIVATE PILOT 
JUDGED THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS NOT ACCELERATING SATISFACTORILY AND 
ELECTED TO ABORT THE TAKEOFF. THE PILOT APPLIED BRAKES BUT WAS UNABLE 
TO STOP THE AIRCRAFT BEFORE IT RAN OFF THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY 
AND COLLIDED WITH TREES. BOTH THE PRIVATE PILOT AND THE INSTRUMENT 
INSTRUCTOR REPORTED THAT IT HAD BEEN RAINING IN THE AREA PRIOR TO THE 
FLIGHT, AND THE RUNWAY WAS WET, WITH STANDING WATER IN SPOTS. THE PILOT 
STATED THAT THE WATER 'DAMPERED THE BRAKING ACTION CONSIDERABLY.' 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
PILOT'S INADEQUATE AIRCRAFT CONTROL DURING THE ABORTED TAKEOFF 
ATTEMPT, AND THE AIRCRAFT'S RESULTANT COLLISION WITH TREES. THE WET 
RUNWAY WAS A FACTOR IN THE LACK OF NORMAL BRAKING ACTION.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
