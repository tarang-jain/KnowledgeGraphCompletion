Analysis 
THE COMMERCIAL AIR TAXI PILOT AND HIS PASSENGER WERE UNINJURED 
FOLLOWING A FORCED LANDING. THE PILOT SAID THAT HE HAD FLOWN OVER HIS 
INTENDED LANDING SITE AT RUSSIAN MISSION, AK., TO INSPECT THE RUNWAY. ON 
THE DOWNWIND LEG, THE ENGINE OF CESSNA 207 LOST MOST OF ITS POWER. HE 
WAS UNABLE TO RESTORE SUFFICIENT POWER TO REMAIN AIRBORNE AND ELECTED 
TO LAND ON THE NEARBY, FROZEN, YUKON RIVER. HE SAID THAT HE MISJUDGED 
HIS ALTITUDE DURING THE LANDING APPROACH DUE TO THE FEATURELESS, ALL 
WHITE SURFACE OF THE RIVER, AND STRUCK THE SURFACE WHILE STILL IN A 
SLIGHT RIGHT TURN. INSPECTION OF THE CRASH SITE TWO DAYS AFTER THE 
ACCIDENT REVEALED NUMEROUS ICE CRYSTALS IN THE LEFT FUEL TANK SUMP. NO 
OTHER OBVIOUS ABNORMALITIES WERE NOTED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF THE ICE 
CRYSTALS FOUND IN THE FUEL TANK WERE CONTRIBUTORY TO THE ACCIDENT DUE 
TO THE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE SAMPLE AND THE ACCIDENT. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
THE PARTIAL ENGINE POWER LOSS DUE TO UNDETERMINED REASONS. 
CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT WAS THE PILOT'S IMPROPER INFLIGHT 
PLANNING BY FLYING AT A TRAFFIC PATTERN ALTITUDE INSUFFICIENT TO INSURE A 
SAFE EMERGENCY LANDING EITHER ON OR OFF THE AIRPORT AND HIS 
MISJUDGEMENT OF CLEARANCE ABOVE THE FROZEN RIVER.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
