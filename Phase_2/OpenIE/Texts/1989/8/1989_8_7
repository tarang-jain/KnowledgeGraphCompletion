Analysis 
THE PILOT HAD BEEN MAKING AGRICULTURAL AERIAL APPLICATION FLIGHTS ALL 
DAY WITH SOME INTERRUPTIONS FOR RAIN.  HE HAD BEEN APPLYING LANNATE 
AND BRAVO; THE LOAD ABOARD AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WAS THE SAME.  
AFTER A LUNCH BREAK, THE PILOT MADE ONE FLIGHT & LOADED FOR THE NEXT.  
THE LIFTOFF AND DEPARTURE WERE REPORTED TO BE NORMAL, BUT WHEN THE 
HELICOPTER DID NOT RETURN AS EXPECTED, A SEARCH WAS INITIATED.  
WRECKAGE OF THE HELICOPTER WAS FOUND NEAR THE INTENDED AERIAL 
APPLICATION SITE.  NO PREIMPACT MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION OR FAILURE WAS 
FOUND; HOWEVER, THE HELICOPTER WAS EXTENSIVELY DAMAGED.  A TOXICOLOGY 
CHECK OF THE PILOT'S BLOOD REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF METHOMYL (LANNATE) 
AT A LEVEL OF 600 PARTS/BILLION.  THE PILOT HAD NOT BEEN USING A 
RESPIRATOR.  HIS LAST RPRTD MEDICAL CHECK WAS ON 2/7/89. 
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
IMPROPER PLANNING/DECISION BY THE PILOT, WHICH RESULTED IN HIS PHYSICAL 
IMPAIRMENT FROM EXPOSURE TO LANNATE, AND HIS FAILURE TO MAINTAIN 
ALTITUDE/CLEARANCE ABOVE THE GROUND.  A FACTOR RELATED TO THE 
ACCIDENT WAS:  FAILURE OF THE PILOT TO USE A RESPIRATOR WHILE HANDLING 
OR BEING EXPOSED TO LANNATE.,

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
