Factual Information
On August 1, 2012, about 1145 mountain daylight time, a Piper PA-18-150, N7808Z, ground 
looped and impacted terrain during an after landing taxi at Meadow Lake Airport (FLY), 
Peyton, Colorado. The airline transport pilot was uninjured. The airplane sustained substantial 
damage to the left wing. The airplane was registered to and operated by High Flights Soaring 
Club Inc (HFSC) under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a glider tow 
flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which had not been operating 
on a flight plan. The local flight originated from FLY about 1000.
The pilot stated that before he towed anyone on any given day, he flew the tow airplane in the 
FLY traffic pattern and performed at least three simulated tow patterns and landings. On the 
day of the accident, the pilot was scheduled to be the on-duty tow pilot for HFSC. He 
performed several full-stop landings on runways 15 (6,000 feet by 60 feet, asphalt) and NS 
(1,800 feet by 15 feet, north 1,530 feet paved with asphalt) even though no one was scheduled 
to fly a sailplane. After his last full-stop landing, he cleared runway NS at mid-runway and 
taxied in a continuous sweeping right turn toward the northwest to the tie down area. About 
half-way through the right turn heading west, the airplane's right wing suddenly lifted 
upwards, which resulted in the left wing contacting the ground "in the blink of an eye" and 
before he could apply corrective control input. He did not see any airplane damage at first 
glance from the cockpit and continued the taxi to the tie down area without further incident.  
 
Postflight inspection of the airplane by the pilot and a mechanic revealed that the fabric for the 
top left wing was wrinkled, and the left rear wing spar was bent.
The pilot stated that the accident could have been prevented if he had been more vigilant in 
watching and immediately correcting for any wind gust conditions that might upset the 
airplane during taxi. He said to always fly the airplane to the chocks, never relax.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
