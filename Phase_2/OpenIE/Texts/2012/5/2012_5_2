Analysis   
According to the certified flight instructor (CFI), the student pilot was practicing touch-and-go 
landings. During the second touch-and-go, as the airplane rotated for takeoff, it hit a deer. The 
CFI took control of the airplane, continued the takeoff, and established that there were no 
vibrations and that the airplane was controllable. The CFI elected to divert to a nearby airport 
where emergency services were available, if needed, and landed without further incident. 
Examination of the airplane revealed that the right wing strut and right gear mount were bent, 
and the right side of the fuselage was buckled.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
