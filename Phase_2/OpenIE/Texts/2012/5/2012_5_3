Location:
San Antonio, TX
Accident Number:
CEN12CA277
Date & Time:
05/01/2012, 1615 CDT 
Registration:
N94500
Aircraft:
CESSNA 152
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Hard landing
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The solo student pilot intended to practice takeoffs and landings at a nearby airport. On the 
first landing, the airplane touched down on the main wheels and bounced. The nose landing 
gear subsequently impacted the runway, separating the nosewheel and landing gear strut. The 
airplane sustained substantial damage to the firewall and wing struts. The pilot noted that she 
had very little practice with straight-in approaches. In addition, she thought that using the 
traffic pattern to set up for the landing might have prevented the accident. The student pilot's 
logbook revealed that this was her second solo flight and the first time she traveled to the 
nearby airport without a flight instructor on board. She had logged a total of 1/2 hour of solo 
flight time prior to the accident flight. Several flights had been logged between the student 
pilot's home airport and the nearby airport with a flight instructor on board. The logbook 
contained a current solo endorsement and an endorsement for repeated solo flights between 
the airports involved.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's misjudgment of the landing flare, which resulted in a hard/bounced landing 
and subsequent impact with the runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
