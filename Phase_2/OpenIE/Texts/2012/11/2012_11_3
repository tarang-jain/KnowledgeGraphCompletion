Analysis   
The student pilot reported that he was conducting a solo flight in the airport traffic pattern at 
the time of the accident. He stated that the airplane made a "soft landing on [the] main 
wheels." However, once the nose landing gear touched down, the airplane "darted" to the left. 
His attempts to maintain control were unsuccessful, and the airplane departed the runway 
pavement. A postaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies related to the nosewheel 
steering or main wheel brakes. The recorded wind was calm about the time of the accident.

The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's loss of directional control during landing.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
