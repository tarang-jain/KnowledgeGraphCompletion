Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Shelter Island, NY
Accident Number:
ERA12LA132
Date & Time:
01/02/2012, 1500 EST 
Registration:
N8282P
Aircraft:
PIPER PA-34-200T
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Landing gear collapse
Injuries:
1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis 
The pilot stated that after crossing over trees at the runway threshold, the airplane experienced 
a downdraft and decay in airspeed. The airplane touched down hard and bounced, and the 
right main landing gear separated from the airplane. Detailed examination of the landing gear 
revealed that the retraction arm fractured at its bolt connection, which allowed the oleo strut to 
rotate, where it sheared at the wheel axle assembly. None of the fracture surfaces exhibited 
evidence of any preexisting cracks or signatures of fatigue.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
A hard landing, which resulted in a failure of the right main and collapse of the left main 
landing gear.
Findings
Aircraft
Landing flare - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Pilot (Cause)

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On January 2, 2012, approximately 1500 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-34-200T, N8282P, 
was substantially damaged during landing at a private airport near Shelter Island, New York. 
The certificated airline transport pilot was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight, which originated from 
Farmingdale Airport (FRG), Farmingdale, New York. The flight was operated under the 
provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.
The pilot stated that he departed FRG and completed the flight to Shelter Island at an altitude 
of 1,400 feet. He reported moderate turbulence during the flight, and stated that a nearby 
airport reported surface winds from 280 degrees at 19 knots. The pilot entered the airport 
traffic pattern for runway 22, a 1,800-ft-long by 100-ft-wide turf runway, and stated that he 
crossed over trees at the runway threshold at an indicated airspeed of 87 kts. He stated that 
after crossing the trees, the airplane experienced a downdraft and decay in airspeed. The 
airplane touched down "hard" and bounced, and the right main landing gear separated from 
the airplane. The airplane came to rest off the right side, and approximately one-third down 
runway 22.
Postaccident examination by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspectors revealed that 
the right main landing gear fractured at the axle hub, and that the right main wing spar 
sustained substantial damage.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
 
The pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land 
and sea, airplane multiengine land, and rotorcraft-helicopter, in addition to a flight instructor 
certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land, airplane multiengine land, and 
instrument airplane. The pilot reported 18,548 total hours of flight experience, of which 2,500 
hours was in the accident airplane make and model. His most recent flight review was 
conducted on September 27, 2011 in the accident airplane. His most recent FAA second-class 
medical certificate was issued in December, 2011.
 
AIRPLANE INFORMATION
 
The airplane's most recent 100-hour inspection was completed on August 19, 2011 at a total 
time of 3,270.07 flight hours. At the time of the accident, the airplane had accumulated 3,287 
total flight hours. The airplane service manual mandated specific 100-hour-interval 
inspections if the airplane was operated from "soft or unusual terrain." The landing gear were 
to be inspected for cracks, attachment, damage, and cleanliness,  and the wheels inspected for 
cracks, damage, and chipped rims; as well as damage, corrosion, and lubrication of the 
bearings.
METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION  
The 1453 weather observation at Francis S. Gabreski Airport (FOK), located approximately 20 
Page 3 of 5ERA12LA132
nautical miles southwest of the accident site, reported winds from 290 degrees at 15 knots with 
gusts to 21 knots, 10 statute miles visibility, few clouds at 5,500 feet, temperature 4 degrees C, 
dew point -9 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 29.71 inches of mercury. 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Review of the airplane information manual revealed that, given the atmospheric and wind 
conditions about the time of the accident, the landing distance required to clear a 50-foot 
obstacle would have been approximately 1,800 feet. 
The right main landing gear was sent to a private facility, where the components were 
examined macro-and microscopically. The report stated that the gear retraction arm fractured 
at its bolt connection, which allowed the oleo strut to rotate, where it sheared at the wheel axle 
assembly. Analysis of the fracture surfaces did not reveal evidence of any preexisting fatigue 
cracks.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
