Analysis   
The airplane was landing on a grass strip toward the west. The pilot stated that the airplane 
touched down on the centerline of the runway and was slowing down when the airplane 
encountered a strong gust of wind from the right. The pilot was unable to correct for the gust of 
wind and the airplane impacted trees on the left side of the runway. Examination of the 
airplane revealed that the right wing spar was broken, and the left wing spar was bent. The 
pilot stated that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded 
normal operation. The wind at the time of the accident was recorded as 090 degrees at 9 knots.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
