Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot stated that he was turning from the downwind to the base leg of the traffic pattern 
when the airplane™s engine had a total loss of power. The pilot trimmed the airplane for its best 
glide speed and maneuvered the airplane toward the runway. However, the airplane impacted 
the airport™s perimeter fence, which resulted in substantial damage to the right wing. A 
postaccident examination revealed that the engine air inlet cowling ducting had separated from 
its attaching material, and the ducting tube slid into the engine air flow control box, blocking 
the carburetor™s air inlet.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The failure of the airplane™s engine air inlet system resulting in a total loss of engine power.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
