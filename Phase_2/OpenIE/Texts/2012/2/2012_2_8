Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Dinsmore, CA
Accident Number:
WPR12LA090
Date & Time:
02/03/2012, 1230 PST 
Registration:
N3879S
Aircraft:
CESSNA 172E
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Hard landing
Injuries:
1 Serious, 1 Minor
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
According to postaccident statements from both pilots, the flight instructor took control of the 
airplane from the student pilot either at touchdown or just before. The airplane bounced 
several times after touchdown while veering to the right, and the right main wheel rolled off the 
48-foot wide runway into the grass. The flight instructor added full engine power to go around. 
The flight instructor stated that he pulled back on the yoke to try to clear the trees beyond the 
end of the runway, and the airplane stalled and hit the ground. After the airplane™s right wing 
tip contacted the ground, the airplane reversed direction and came to a stop. Shortly after the 
airplane came to rest, a postimpact fire began, which consumed the airplane. The student pilot, 
who was the airplane owner, reported no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with 
the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The flight instructor's delayed remedial action, inadequate recovery from a bounced landing, 
and failure to attain/maintain adequate airspeed during an attempted go-around.
Findings
Aircraft
Landing flare - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Airspeed - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Personnel issues
Aircraft control - Instructor/check pilot (Cause)

Factual Information
On February 3, 2012, about 1230 Pacific standard time, a Cessna 172E, N3879S, veered off 
runway 27 during an aborted landing at the Dinsmore (uncontrolled) airport, Dinsmore, 
California. The airplane came to rest in a field about 50 yards beyond the runway™s end. A post 
impact ground fire occurred, which consumed the substantially damaged airplane. The 
commercial pilot holds a certified flight instructor (CFI) certificate, and he was seriously 
injured. The CFI was providing flight instruction to a student pilot, who was the airplane™s 
registered owner. The student pilot was not injured. Visual meteorological conditions 
prevailed. The flight was performed under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 91. No flight plan was filed. The flight originated about 1115.
The student pilot reported to the National Transportation Safety Board investigator that the 
CFI directed him to land at the Dinsmore airport. However, on final approach, the CFI took the 
flight controls away from him. The student released the controls, and he did not touch them 
again. The wing flaps were extended to the 30-degree setting, and the CFI attempted to land. 
After touching down on the runway, the airplane bounced several times, the right main wheel 
rolled off the 48-foot wide runway into the grass, and the CFI attempted to go around. The CFI 
added full engine power, and the stall warning sounded as the airplane veered back across the 
runway as it continued to bounce. After the airplane™s right wing tip contacted the ground, the 
airplane reversed direction as it cartwheeled to a stop.  Shortly after coming to rest, a post 
impact fire began, which consumed the airplane.
During a telephone conversation the CFI said they took off from Garberville about 1130 for an 
instructional session.  He said he does not recall completely but believes he took over the 
controls either just after the student had landed or just before he touched down. The airplane 
was veering to the right and he decided to do a go around.  The stall warning was going off 
during the go around at the west end of the runway.  He said he was trying to go over the trees 
beyond the end of the runway; he pulled on the yoke to clear the trees and the airplane stalled 
and hit the ground.
The student pilot owner said there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with 
the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
