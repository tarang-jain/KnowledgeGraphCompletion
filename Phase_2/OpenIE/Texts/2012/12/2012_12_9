Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The airplane bounced twice during landing. The pilot said that after the second bounce, he 
added full throttle for a go-around and that the airplane began to drift to the left side of the 
runway centerline. Just as the airplane began to climb, the pilot retracted the landing gear and 
flaps, and the nose of the airplane immediately pitched up. The right wingtip struck the runway 
surface, and the airplane veered sharply to the right and impacted terrain on the right side of 
the runway. The impact resulted in the collapse of the landing gear and substantial damage to 
the engine mount, firewall, fuselage, and horizontal stabilizer. The pilot reported that there was 
no mechanical malfunction or failure and that he just failed to maintain control of the airplane 
during the landing.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's improper recovery from a bounced landing, and his failure to maintain airplane 
control during the go-around maneuver.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
