Analysis   
The non-certificated pilot stated that he purchased the unregistered powered parachute on the 
internet. He stated that he practiced taxiing in the grass beside the runway at a private airport 
for 15 to 20 minutes at a time and that he would occasionally fly the powered parachute about 5 
feet off of the ground and set it back down in the grass. No one witnessed the accident, and the 
powered parachute was found in the grass beside the runway partially inverted with the pilot 
inside. The pilot reported to the responding local law enforcement officer that he was 
attempting to land the aircraft and did not know what had caused the crash. Postaccident 
examination revealed substantial damage to the undercarriage frame and engine mounts. The 
pilot did not keep a pilot log book, had received no flight training, and stated that he had not 
experienced any mechanical issues with the powered parachute.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
