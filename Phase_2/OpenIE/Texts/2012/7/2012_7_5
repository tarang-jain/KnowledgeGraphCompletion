Analysis   
The pilot of the float-equipped airplane reported that he planned to step taxi while making a

power, and started a turn to the left. The airplane turned to the left sharper than he 
anticipated. He applied right rudder and reduced left aileron. As the turn started to straighten 
out, the airplane™s right wing struck the water and sustained substantial damage.  There were 
no preaccident mechanical issues with the airplane.

Note:

to the NTSB.
Investigation Docket:
http://dms.ntsb.gov/pubdms/search/dockList.cfm?mKey=84174
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
