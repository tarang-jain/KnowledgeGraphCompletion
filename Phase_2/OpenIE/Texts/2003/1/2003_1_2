Aviation Accident Final Report
Location:
Milford, UT
Accident Number:
DEN03LA027
Date & Time:
01/01/2003, 2200 MST 
Registration:
N8500R
Aircraft:
Aircraft Mfg & Dev. Co. (AMD) 
CH2000
Aircraft Damage:
Destroyed
Defining Event:
Injuries:
2 Serious
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis 
The two pilots received an in-person weather briefing from the Flight Service Station at 2000.  
They said that they would later air-file an IFR flight plan so that they could practice instrument 
approaches.  They departed about 2100.  Approximately 2200, the Sheriff's Office received a 9-
1-1 cellular telephone call from one of the airplane's occupants, advising that they had crashed, 
one of the occupants was trapped in the wreckage, and that he was unable to activate the ELT 
(emergency locator transmitter).  Using NTAP (National Track Analysis Program) data from 
the Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and homing in on the cellular telephone signals, 
the wreckage was located about midnight.  The two pilots were airlifted to a hospital in serious 
condition.  One of the pilots told a sheriff's detective that they did not see the mountain.  The 
accident site was at an elevation of about 8,500 feet msl.  The Sectional Chart depicted terrain 
in that area at 8,840 feet msl.  The instructor was reportedly "familiar with the area" and did 
not consult his VFR sectional charts.  U.S. Naval Observatory data indicated the Moon's phase 
was a waning crescent, with 1 percent of the visible disk illuminated.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the inadequate altitude chosen by the flight instructor, resulting in inadequate clearance and 
subsequent collision with mountainous terrain.  Contributing factors were the instructor's 
failure to consult pertinent VFR sectional charts for the area, and the dark night conditions.

Factual Information
On January 1, 2003, approximately 2200 mountain standard time, an Aircraft Manufacturing 
& Development Company CH2000, N8500R, registered to and operated by the Salt Lake 
Community College, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain 7.1 miles southeast of 
Milford, Utah.  The commercial certificated flight instructor and private pilot receiving 
instruction were seriously injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight 
plan had been filed for the instructional flight being conducted under Title 14 CFR Part 91.  The 
flight originated at Cedar City, Utah, approximately 2100, and was en route to Salt Lake City, 
Utah.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the two pilots received an in-person weather 
briefing from the Cedar City Flight Service Station at 2000.  They said that when they arrived 
in the vicinity of Delta, Utah, they would air-file an IFR flight plan to Salt Lake City 
International Airport so that they could practice instrument approaches.  They departed about 
2100.  Approximately 2200, the Beaver County Sheriff's Office received a 9-1-1 cellular 
telephone call from one of the airplane's occupants, advising that they had "crashed north of 
Milford," one of the occupants was trapped in the wreckage, and that he was unable to activate 
the ELT (emergency locator transmitter).  Using NTAP (National Track Analysis Program) data 
from the Salt Lake City Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and homing in on the 
cellular telephone signals, the wreckage was located about midnight, 7.1 miles east-southeast of 
the Milford VORTAC on the 116 degree radial.  The two pilots were airlifted to a Salt Lake City 
hospital in serious condition.
One of the pilots told a sheriff's detective that they did not see the mountain.  The accident site 
was at an elevation of about 8,500 feet msl.  The Salt Lake City Sectional Chart depicts terrain 
in that area at 8,840 feet msl.  The instructor was reportedly "familiar with the area" and did 
not consult his VFR sectional charts.
U.S. Naval Observatory data indicated the Moon's phase was a waning crescent, with 1 percent 
of the visible disk illuminated.

NTSB accident and incident dockets serve as permanent archival information for the NTSB™s 
investigations. Dockets released prior to June 1, 2009 are publicly available from the NTSB™s

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
