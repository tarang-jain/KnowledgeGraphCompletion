Analysis   
The helicopter's main rotor struck the tail boom while the pilot was practicing a run-on 
landing.  While the student pilot was attempting to execute a landing, he touched down on the 
heels of the skids.  The helicopter rocked forward and the pilot pulled back on the cyclic.  As a 
result, the main rotor blades made contact with the tail boom.  No mechanical problems were 
noted with the helicopter.  The student pilot had accumulated about 58 hours in helicopters, 
with 7 as pilot-in-command.  The operator reported that students were not permitted to 
practice run-on landings during solo flight.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
the student pilot's inappropriate remedial action through the application of excessive aft cyclic 
during a run-on landing.  A factor in the accident was the student's disregard for company 
procedures.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
