Analysis 
During the landing rollout the airplane encountered a gust of wind and nosed over.  The pilot

28-knot gusts.  The pilot made a straight-in approach and touched down without incident on 
runway 26.  During the rollout, a wind gust was encountered.  The pilot indicated that despite 
his efforts at maintaining airplane control, he lost control and the airplane nosed over on the 
runway.

Factual Information
On May 1, 2003, about 1400 Pacific daylight time, a Cessna 170A, N1607D, nosed over during 
landing rollout at the Twentynine Palms (uncontrolled) Airport, Twentynine Palms, California.  
The airplane, operated by the pilot, was substantially damaged.  Neither the commercial pilot 
nor the passenger was injured.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed during the personal 
flight that was performed under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91.  No flight plan was filed.  The 
flight originated fromTehachapi, California, about 1250.  
The pilot reported that approaching Twentynine Palms for landing he had received the local 
weather information from the airport's Unicom operator.  The pilot indicated that the wind was 
from about 320 degrees at 12 knots, with occasional 28-knot gusts.  The pilot made a straight-
in approach and made a wheel landing without incident on runway 26, between 400 and 500 
feet beyond the runway's threshold.  During rollout, the airplane began to weathervane to the 
right.  The pilot stated that he initially maintained directional control by applying rudder and 
left brake.  However, as he lowered the tail he lost control when a wind gust was encountered, 
and the airplane nosed over on the runway.   According to the pilot, during the accident no 
mechanical malfunctions or failures were experienced with the airplane.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
