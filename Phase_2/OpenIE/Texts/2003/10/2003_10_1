Analysis 
Upon returning to the airport the pilot requested a traffic advisory and a glider pilot 
announced he was in the traffic pattern for runway 36. The pilot announced that he would 
extend his downwind and base to final to give the glider time to land. He stated that he went 
through his pre-landing checklist but elected not to lower the gear at that time, instead he 
lowered the flaps and proceeded to turn base to final. He said that he spotted the glider on the 
ground about one mile out on final and proceeded to land and forgot that he had not lowered 
his landing gear until he heard the gear warning horn and landed with the gear retracted. The 
pilot did not report a mechanical problem with the airplane during the landing. According to 
the pilot, he had accumulated over 750 landings in retractable geared airplanes and had never 
forgot to put the gear down until now.
Probable Cause and Findings

Factual Information
On October 1, 2003, at 1738 central daylight time, a Beech 58, N7219H, registered to and 
operated by the private pilot collided with the ground during landing at Columbus-Lowndes 
County Airport, Columbus, Mississippi. The personal flight was operated under the provisions 
of Title 14 CFR Part 91, and visual flight rules. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and 
no flight plan was filed. The pilot was not injuries and the airplane sustained minor damage. 
The flight originated from Columbus-Lowndes County Airport Columbus, Mississippi, on 
October 1, 2003, at 1721.

about two and one-half weeks since the airplane had been flown. He remained in the area and 
about 20 minutes later announced over the Unicom that he was 10 miles out and was going to 
enter the traffic pattern for a downwind approach to runway 36. He requested a traffic advisory 
and a glider pilot announced he was in the traffic pattern for runway 36. The pilot stated that 
he announced that he would extend his downwind and base to final to give the glider time to 
land. The pilot said that he went through his pre-landing check list but elected not to lower the 
gear at that time, instead he lowered the flaps and proceeded to turn base to final. He said that 
he spotted the glider on the ground about one mile out on final and proceeded to land and 
forgot that he had not lowered his landing gear until he heard the gear warning horn and 
landed on the belly of the airplane. 
Damage to the airplane consisted of both propellers, fuselage skin damage, and the inboard 
section of both flaps. The pilot did not report a mechanical problem with the airplane during 
the landing. According to the pilot, he had accumulated over 750 landings in retractable geared 
airplanes and had never forgot to put the gear down until now.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
