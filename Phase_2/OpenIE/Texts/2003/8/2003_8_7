Analysis 
The unregistered two-place airplane was destroyed on impact with terrain.  The non-
instrument rated pilot was fatally injured.  The accident pilot was told by his wife prior to the 
flight that the weather conditions at the destination were foggy.  The accident pilot replied to 
his wife that he could see the tops of the trees "and he was going to fly low and follow the rail 
road tracks."  The Sheriff's report stated the pilot's brother said that "it was too foggy to be 
flying.  The only reason he was flying was to look for [the accident pilot,] his brother."
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's intentional flight into known fog and failure to maintain aircraft control during 
cruise flight.  A factor was the fog, and the low altitude flight.

Factual Information
HISTORY OF FLIGHT
On August 2, 2003, about 0630 central daylight time, an unregistered Teratorn two-place 
airplane, piloted by a private pilot, was destroyed on impact with terrain about three quarters 
of a mile west of the Elbow Lake Municipal Airport (Y63), near Elbow Lake, Minnesota.  The 
personal flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 91.  Instrument meteorological conditions 
prevailed at the time of the accident.  No flight plan was on file.  The pilot was fatally injured.  
The flight originated from a private airstrip near Elbow Lake, Minnesota, about 0600, and was 
en route to Y63 at the time of the accident.
The Grant County Sheriff's report stated that prior to the flight the pilot's wife told the accident 
pilot that the weather conditions at Elbow Lake Airport were foggy.  The report said that the 
accident pilot replied that he could see the tops of the trees "and he was going to fly low and 
follow the rail road tracks into Elbow Lake."
The Grant County Sheriff's report stated:
[The accident pilot's brother] told me that he had flown from Fergus Falls 
to Elbow Lake this morning looking for his brother's plane which had 
not arrived at the Elbow Lake Airport.  ... [He] then called [his brother's 
wife] and ... asked what direction [the accident pilot] was taking to get 
to the airport.  [She] said that he was following the train tracks east that 
come from Wendell to Elbow Lake.  [He] then flew over the railroad tracks 
and followed them east to Elbow Lake and found his brother's plane in the 
wheat field.  ... [He] said that it was too foggy to be flying.  The only reason 
he was flying was to look for his brother.
PERSONNEL INFORMATION
The pilot held a private pilot certificate with a single-engine land airplane rating.  His FAA 
third-class medical certificate was issued on December 26, 2002, with a limitation for 
corrective lenses.  On his application for that flight physical, the pilot reported that he had 
accumulated 12 total flight hours.  His pilot certificate was issued on April 23, 2003.  On his 
application for that certificate, the pilot reported that he had accumulated 45.8 total flight 
hours of which 3 hours were listed as instrument flight time.
AIRCRAFT INFORMATION
The accident airplane was an unregistered Teratorn, two-place airplane.  The original kit 
manufacturer is no longer in business.  The airplane's original kit builder could not be 
confirmed.  The accident airplane was a single-engine, high-wing airplane.  Its engine was a 
64-horsepower Rotax 532 engine, serial number 3488536.  The engine was shipped from its 
manufacturer in April of 1985 to Teratorn Aircraft.  The propeller was a three-bladed, 66-inch

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
