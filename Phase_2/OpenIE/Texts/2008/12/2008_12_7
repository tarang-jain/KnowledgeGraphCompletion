Analysis   
The twin-engine airplane was being operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration conducting snow survey flights.  The airplane initially departed from the Grand 
Forks International Airport (GFK), Grand Forks, North Dakota, and made a refueling stop at 
the Fargo International Airport, Fargo, North Dakota. The airplane was on a repositioning 
flight back to GFK when the accident occurred. During the flight, the airplane was cleared by 
air traffic control for the runway 17R localizer backcourse approach to GFK. The airplane 
landed on runway 17R with the landing gear in the retracted position, resulting in substantial 
damage to the airplane. Subsequently, the engines were shut down and the aircraft was 
evacuated.  The minimum descent altitude and visibility requirements for the approach were 
1,200 feet above mean sea level (msl) and 1 mile respectively. The ceiling and visibility at the 
time of the accident were 800 feet (about 1,650 feet msl) and 1 mile respectively. The operator 
noted that there were no mechanical malfunctions.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
