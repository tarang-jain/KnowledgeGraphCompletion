He cleared for traffic and started his takeoff roll.  Approaching the crest of the runway he saw 
an airplane landing in front of him.  He steered his airplane into corn near the runway to avoid 
the collision.

The pilot's selection of the unsuitable terrain next to the runway to avoid the landing traffic.  
Contributing to the accident was the hill in the middle of the runway that blocked the pilot's 
view of the other traffic and the high vegetation near the runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
