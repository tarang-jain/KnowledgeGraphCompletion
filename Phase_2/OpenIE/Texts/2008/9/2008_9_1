Flight Conducted Under:
Part 135: Air Taxi & Commuter - Non-scheduled
Analysis   
The commercial pilot related that he was attempting to land at a rough and uneven remote 
airstrip, which was surrounded by mountainous terrain. He added that the southerly approach 
to the airstrip required a correction for variable, easterly winds between 5 and 10 knots. He 
said that just before touchdown he elected to add engine power to avoid an area of rough 
terrain on the northern end of the site. The airplane ballooned, and landed about mid-length 
along the 1,500 foot-long, by 30 feet-wide airstrip. After touchdown, the pilot realized that he 
would be unable to stop the airplane before reaching the end of the airstrip, and he added full 
engine power to abort the landing, but the airplane failed to become airborne again. The 
airplane continued off the south end of the site, down an embankment, and into a creek bed. 
The airplane sustained structural damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage. The pilot 
noted that there were no preaccident mechanical anomalies with the airplane.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's delay in aborting the landing. A factor contributing to the accident was a variable 
wind.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
