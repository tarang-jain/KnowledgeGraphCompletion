Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The flight crew was advised by air traffic control that the wind was from 320 degrees at 13 
knots with gusts to 16 knots, and was cleared for a touch-and-go landing on runway 35. After 
touchdown with neutral aileron and rudder control input, the student glanced to remove 
carburetor heat and retract the flaps but looked outside of the cockpit and noted the airplane 
was moving towards the right side of the runway and was not lined up. The certified flight 
instructor took control of the airplane and attempted to correct but the right main landing gear 
collided with a snow bank at the right edge of the runway.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
