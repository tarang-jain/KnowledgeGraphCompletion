Substantial

Part 91: General Aviation - Personal
Analysis   
The pilot reported that the airplane entered the airport traffic pattern, and he made a visual 
approach to runway 35 with a 90 degree crosswind. He stated that he was "slow" on final, and 
when he touched down using a soft field landing procedure, the airplane was "pushed" off the 
runway by a wind gust, contacted a snow bank with the left main landing gear tire, and nosed 
over. Both wings were damaged.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions, and his failure to obtain/maintain 
directional control. Contributing factors were a crosswind and a snow bank.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
