10/01/2008, 1520 CDT 
Registration:
N251ND
Aircraft:
PIPER PA-28-161
Aircraft Damage:
Substantial
Defining Event:
Loss of control on ground

1 None
Flight Conducted Under:
Part 91: General Aviation - Instructional
Analysis   
The student pilot stated that he was established on final approach for runway 31 (4,300 feet by 
75 feet, dry asphalt) and "everything was on track."  When the airplane crossed the threshold, 
he reduced engine power and began the landing flare.  After touchdown, the student pilot 
applied the brakes, which resulted in a skid and he was unable to maintain control.  The 
airplane subsequently departed the runway pavement and came to rest in a ditch.  The left 
main landing gear collapsed.  The student pilot was performing his first landing on his initial 
solo flight at the time of the accident.  He noted that the skies were clear and the winds were 
calm.  The pilot reported that he had accumulated 13 hours total flight time, with 9 hours in the 
same make and model airplane.  A post accident inspection did not reveal any anomalies 
associated with a pre impact failure or malfunction.
Probable Cause and Findings
The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
The student pilot's failure to maintain directional control during landing.  A contributing factor 
was the student pilot's limited flight experience.  Additional factors were the presence of the 
ditch adjacent to the runway and the resulting collapse of the left main landing gear.
Findings
Aircraft
Directional control - Not attained/maintained (Cause)
Main gear strut/axle/truck - Capability exceeded (Factor)
Personnel issues
Total experience - Student pilot (Factor)
Environmental issues
Sloped/uneven terrain - Contributed to outcome (Factor)

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established in 1967, is an independent federal agency mandated 
by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine 
the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate 
the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The NTSB makes public its actions and 
decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and 
statistical reviews. 
The Independent Safety Board Act, as codified at 49 U.S.C. Section 1154(b), precludes the admission into evidence 
or use of any part of an NTSB report related to an incident or accident in a civil action for damages resulting from a 
matter mentioned in the report.
