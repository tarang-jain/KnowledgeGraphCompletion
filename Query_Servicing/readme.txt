Folder contents:
-Slides and Papers: It contains the slides and research papers relevant with the project  updates.

-myproject: This folder contains the python code files used for developing graphical user interface.
  
  -aircraft_base.owl and AircraftAccident.owl files are ontology schema and populated ontology that is Knowledge graph. These two files should be kept 
  within the same folder.
  
  -The extracted_cause.txt file contains the unstructed information about the cause of accident as mentioned in NTSB report. The python code used to 
  extract this information is written in the file cause_extraction.py.
  
  -nlqapp: The subfolder nlqapp contains the files and folders that categorises the codes based upon the django MTV(Model-Template-View) architecture.
	-The templates folder in nlqapp refers to the presentation layer that manages the presentation logic in the 
	framework and essentially controls the content to display and how to display it for the user. It has different files for various functionalities, 
		-home.html file contains the html code for the designing of user interface.
		-views.py file communicates with the knowledge base and the data which transfer to the template for viewing. 
		-nlqpy_new.py file is used to generate the sparql query for a natural language query.
		-nlqpy2.py file is used to find all the instances available in knowledge graph.
		-nlqpy3.py file contains the code to find all the subclasses of a particular class.
		-nlqpy4.py file contains the code to find the list of all the classes within a knowledge graph.
		-nlqpy5.py file contains the code to find the superclasses of a particular class.
		-search_all.py file contains methods to find the class and predicates of instances from the knowledge graph that helps in generating                  the sparql query.
		-The search_accident.py file takes the sparql query generated by the nlqpy_new.py python file and then retrieves the information from                  the AircraftAccident.owl file.
		-urls.py, tests.py, models.py, apps.py, admin.py, migrations, __pycache__ and __init__.py are inbuilt files having a predefined role in Django framework.

    -The sparql folder contains the predefined files that stores the path of different django models. 
	-The manage.py file is executed to run the django server at the localhost by using the command: 'python manage.py runserver'
	-Now the path of desired django model is concatinated at with the ip address generated for django server.

User Interface Execution Process:
    Softwares:
        -Python 3
        -Anaconda
	-Owlready2
	-Spacy library
	-Django

    Execution:
	-Change the path in the python files of templates folder for AircraftAccident.owl file and aircraft_base.owl file
        -Run the manage.py file in myproject folder using command: python manage.py runserver
        -open the browser go to the url: http://127.0.0.1:8000/nlqapp/
	-(Note: Internet Connection is required while executing the program)
	-The query is typed on the interface and then submit button is pressed for the execution.
